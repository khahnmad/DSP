http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/330264121.html,"Crime, courts and legal issues in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin By Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel The Wisconsin Court of Appeals on Thursday affirmed the convictions of a man responsible for killing four people at a Fourth of July street party in 2008. James Washington was one of three men charged with shooting into a crowd, fatally hitting four people. Killed were Kendrick L. Jackson, 34, Jacoby E. Claybrooks, 28, and  Theresa Raddle, 23, all of Milwaukee; and Marielle Fisher, 27, of  Glendale. One of the three men charged, Rosario Fuentez, pleaded guilty and testified that Washington had a rifle, and while Fuentez did not see him shooting directly, he saw shots coming from where Washington was standing between two houses, and that he later heard Washington say he was out of ammunition. As part of his appeal, Washington cited Fuentez's written recantation of his trial testimony. After the trial, Fuentez wrote that he only mentioned Washington to help himself escape worse punishment. He admits he fired weapons over the crowd, hoping to scare people into running away, but that Washington was not even present. The appellate opinion notes that, at a post trial motion hearing, the trial judge had determined the written recantation was not credible, and likely the result of intimidation. At that hearing, Fuentez invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, and said only, “if that’s what’s in there, if that’s what the affidavit says, you got the letters, the affidavit, it’s in my handwriting, I ain’t going to say no more.” The appeals court found, ""The circuit court’s finding that Fuentez’s recantation was not credible is supported by the evidence and is, therefore, not clearly erroneous."" The court also rejected Washington's claims that his lawyer was ineffective, and that the trial court judge had biased the jury when she told jurors Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. Fuentez agreed to plead guilty to four counts of first-degree reckless homicide in exchange for a 20-year sentence. He also testified against Antonio ""Cheem"" Williams, who, like Washington, was also convicted of four courts of first degree intentional homicide and sentenced to life in prison.

	Variety Staff Follow Us on Twitter At least 10 people have been killed in a shooting rampage at an Oregon college that sent TV news reporters scrambling to piece together sketchy information emanating from Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. The 26-year-old male gunman, who has been identified as Chris Harper Mercer, was killed after a confrontation with police, according to local law enforcement officials According to ABC affiliate KATU-TV Portland, Oregon State Police said that 20 people were injured in the attack. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown appeared shaken as she expressed “profound dismay and heartbreak at this tragedy. … We are holding the community of Douglas County in our hearts today.” The shootings began to unfold at 10:38 a.m. PT in a building that houses science facilities on the college’s large campus in the logging community situated in the south-central region of the state, about 179 miles south of Portland.  The campus was evacuated, with students and faculty taken by bus to nearby Douglas County Fairgrounds, and remained on lockdown Thursday afternoon. Umpqua is said to have about 3,000 full-time students. Within minutes of the attack there were horrifying first-hand accounts of the shooting streaming out via social media and Twitter — reports of students and teachers huddling together in classrooms in terror and students waving other students away from the campus as they tried to head to class. Students are running everywhere. Holy God. — Kayla Marie (@KP_KaylaMarie) October 1, 2015  The Oregon shootings join a long line of mass shootings that spark saturation media coverage. The rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech University in 2007 remains the worst mass shooting in the nation’s history, with 33 left dead. In December 2012, the nation was rattled by the slayings of 26 people, 20 of them children, at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Columbine, Colo., has become synonymous with the mass shootings carried out at a high school there by two students in 1999 that left 13 dead and more than 20 wounded. Movie theaters have also become the site of attacks. In July 2012, James Holmes opened fire at an Aurora, Colo., multiplex, killing 12 and wounding 70 during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.” In August he was sentenced to life in prison. In July, a gunman shot three people in a in Lafayette, La., theater that was screening the comedy “Trainwreck.” Gun violence came shockingly close to home for TV news reporters in August when two employees of CBS affiliate WDBJ-TV in Roanoke, Va., were shot to death during a live broadcast by a former station employee. The remote site of the Oregon shootings — far removed from the state’s urban center in Portland — made it harder for the national news networks to get immediate live coverage of the events. Even network affiliate stations with news operations in the larger town of Eugene were still 70 miles away from Roseburg. As such, TV news networks scrambled to contact students, law enforcement and others by phone and online to gather information. The news coverage on MSBNC and others followed a somber ritual of talking heads decrying the easy availability of guns and the lack of mental health services for those who might be identified as potential threats.  “To have a mass shooting of this magnitude in Oregon is positively unspeakable to us,” Oregon’s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, told MSNBC.

The sheriff was not able to release an exact count of the injured or the death toll during the ongoing press conference. Shooting in Oregon Update - Roseburg police are now reporting that the UCC shooting was confined to a single classroom. The White House has already called for more stringent gun laws in the wake of the Umpqua Community College shooting. Second Amendment advocates were quick to point out that the Roseburg, Oregon school was a ""gun free zone"" and feel that perhaps some of the students could have survived if a staff member or student had been permitted to carry a handgun on campus. The White House has come under criticism on social media for the decision to enter into a gun control debate so quickly in the wake of the tragedy. No details are yet known about the identity of the shooter or a possible motive in the horrific school shooting. UCC Shooting Update -- Local officials have now confirmed that 15 people are dead in the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon. No details about the alleged gunman, or a motive for the shooting, have yet emerged.

The shooting took place at the western Oregon college campus on Thursday morning, with reports that as many as 15 people were killed in a mass shooting. Police said they have detained the shooting suspect and that the danger to students is over, but the death toll from the attack has continued to rise.  — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) October 1, 2015  — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) October 1, 2015   The post reads as follows.  happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning so long space robots""  happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning so long space robots""  Some of the users on 4chan also appeared to egg on the person, though they may not have known if the threat was legitimate.

Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it is possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.""  ""Willl post again in am, 10 min countdown. Won't say much more to prepare."" If true, this would not be the first time that someone has left evidence of their crime on 4chan. In November, a man identified as David Kalac allegedly posted a picture of a dead and half-naked woman along with a confession that he had murdered her. ""Turns out it's way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks in the movies,"" the first post read. Though some doubted the authenticity, police in Port Orchard, Washington, later confirmed that the details fit a recent homicide. The Port Orchard Independent reported that police found the body of a woman in her early 30s who matched the pictures seen on 4chan. ""It's a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,"" Sheriff's Office spokesman Scott Wilson said. Kalac also stole the woman's vehicle, and appeared to promise more bloodshed.
""I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough,"" the user wrote. ""When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the f****** news. I have to lose my phone now."" But Kalac was ultimately arrested without incident and charged in the woman's murder. The 4chan post that seemed to predict the Oregon community college shooting was shared on Reddit on Thursday afternoon, where it attracted hundreds of user upvotes. Some called out the users who seemed to egg the shooter on, but others noted that there was likely no way of stopping the massacre. ""This is what a lot of people fail to recognize with internet hate,"" one user wrote. ""People have been crying for attention for a long time, with thinly veiled threats of suicide and homicide. There's no point coddling and negotiating with these types because the real psychopaths will just see reward in making more threats."" There is no confirmation yet whether the 4chan post that appeared to predict the Oregon community college shooting is legitimate. Police said the suspect has been neutralized, but they have not yet said if the person is alive or dead. [Image via KDFW Fox 4 screenshot]"

ROSEBURG, Oregon — Hannah Miles went to Umpqua Community College to study nursing, considering to one day work in an emergency room. On Thursday, her classroom became an emergency room when 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured seven. “Not what I expected, my first year of college,” Miles told The Daily Beast. At about 10:30 a.m., Miles said she heard “a yardstick or ruler smacking against a chalkboard.” A fellow student joked that it sounded like a shotgun, she said. Then shots came “one after the other” as she heard people in the next room cry out. Teacher Amy Fair led the class to a nearby bookstore where all the students took refuge in a back room. Miles said she left everything—her phone, wallet, purse, and books—behind. “It was utter chaos, the fear and the panic,” Miles said of running for her life. Student Kortney Moore told the News Review that the gunman entered her classroom after firing a shot through the window. Moore said she saw her teacher get shot in the head. The gunman told everyone to get on the floor, according to Moore, then asked people to stand up and state their religion before opening fire. Douglas County Sherrif Douglas Hanlin said officers immediately responded and exchanged fire with the gunman, who is dead. Umpqua is the fourth shooting on a college campus since August and the deadliest since the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32. There have been at least 142 school shootings in the U.S. since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, according to Every Town for Gun Safety. This isn’t even the first school shooting in Roseburg: In 2006, a high school freshman shot another student in the back four times. Thursday was the fourth day of school at Umpqua, so Miles and her classmates were mostly strangers to each other. By the end of the day, they were hugging and crying in the book store’s back room. “Yes, [the shooting] was unthinkable,” she said, “but it is even more incredible that people can become supporters for one another.” Miles said the day makes her want to be a nurse “more than ever.” “I can tell you, I’m going back to UCC.” Scenes From the Oregon College Shooting (PHOTOS)"

She estimated roughly 20 ambulances and 75 police cars, including police officials in their private vehicles, pouring into the area. Officials aren't allowing students to leave campus in their own vehicles, Andrews said, they are bussing them out. ""Everybody is in shock. Very very shocked,"" Andrews said. Umpqua Community College, located about three hours south of Portland, has a student body of almost 5,000 students, most part time. The school sits six miles outside Roseburg, a timber town where the downturn in the logging industry has hurt the finances of many families. Kristapher Yates, president of Umpqua Community College's student council last year, was in the student leadership center Thursday morning when an adviser notified he and his classmates the school was on lockdown. ""We were behind a door, and we shut the door, and we stayed in this room,"" said Yates, 35. He didn't hear or see the shooting himself, but said students he had spoken with told him the shots were fired at Snyder Hall. At least four English classes were meeting there at the time. Students and faculty are being bused from campus to the Douglas County Fairgrounds. ""It's a small community,"" said Yates, now the school's student life liaison, ""but it's very supportive. So we will get through it."" According to crowd-sourced accounts of violence in the United States, this would be the 294th mass shooting this year and the 45th school shooting. It's been a little more than a year since a student killed a classmate and injured a teacher at Reynolds High School outside Portland. Roseburg High School was the site of a school shooting in 2006. Oregon Governor Kate Brown will hold a 1:30 p.m. PST news conference to discuss the shooting, and then will travel to Roseburg.

	Ted Johnson Senior Editor President Obama, reacting to Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., said “somehow this has become routine,” but said change won’t happen until gun laws are strengthened. “Each time this happens, I am going to say, ‘We’re going to have to do something about it,’ but we have got to change our laws,” Obama, appearing angry and frustrated, said in making a statement at the White House. “Someone somewhere, will say ‘Obama politicized this issue,'” Obama said. “This is something we should politicize. This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America.” He called on voters to take a candidates’ position on gun laws into account when making their voting decisions.  “We’ve become numb to this,” he continued. Legislation to expand background checks and close the so-called “gun show” loophole has stalled out in Congress, and, in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012, proposals to strengthen gun laws never made it to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Obama also said that Congress also is blocking data collection “on how we can potentially reduce gun deaths.” According to CBS News’ Mark Knoller, this was the 15th time that Obama has made remarks following a shooting since he became president.

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122997/how-republicans-ignore-gun-control-after-mass-shootings,"Every time there's a mass shooting in America, Republican politicians respond in a strikingly similar way. Thursday was no different. Presidential candidates Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Mike Huckabee responded to news of the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon with tweets expressing their condolences and offering prayers for the victims and their families. What they didn't do, of course, is comment on our country's lenient gun laws. Praying for Umpqua Community College, the victims, and families impacted by this senseless tragedy. My prayers are with everyone in Oregon. May the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, guard your hearts. The thoughts and prayers of Ohioans go out to the families & victims of the tragic shooting in Oregon today. -John Surely the other presidential candidates—if their reaction to the Charleston shooting is any indication—will comment in a similar way, if at all. After Dylann Roof killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June, here's how many of them responded: May the families and the city of Charleston be lifted up by the prayers of our entire nation. http://t.co/WIcKOWRWJy pic.twitter.com/pZ1irL5qbZ My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of last night's shooting in Charleston https://t.co/GCtPg7yQ1r My heart and prayers go out to Charleston, the families who have lost loved ones, and everyone who is hurting... https://t.co/vInh5b4fRy My heart aches for the families of the #Charleston victims.

          pbump To be fair, offering condolences and prayers after a mass shooting isn't just a Republican strategy to avoid discussing the National Rifle Association, automatic assault weapons, and background checks.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114756259/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Obama-Our-thoughts-and-prayers-are-not-enough/,"WASHINGTON — A visibly frustrated President Obama offered condolences to the victims of the mass shooting at an Oregon college on Thursday, but he added that ""our thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" and voters should demand changes to the nation's gun laws. Having now spoken after more than a dozen senseless killings during his administration, Obama again called for ""common sense"" legislation aimed at preventing gun violence, and he mocked opponents of past initiatives he has pushed. USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war ""Each time this happens, I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said during emotional remarks in the White House press room. ""Each time this happens, I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" Obama noted that he has been to Roseburg, Ore., where the shooting took place, and ""there are really good people there"" who are the latest victims of gun violence. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" Throughout his presidency, especially after shootings, Obama has called for legislation to try to stop gun violence, including enhanced background checks, an assault weapons ban, and improved mental health programs. On this occasion, the president said, ""it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm to get his or her hands on a gun."" As he echoed those calls in the wake of the Oregon shooting, Obama predicted that statements of opposition from gun rights groups were already being written. Many of those opponents will accuse him politicizing tragic shootings, the president said. ""Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" He later said: ""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America."" Oregon officials said a 20-year-old man killed at least 10 people in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Obama visited the city during his 2008 presidential campaign. Obama has spoken in the wake of shooting tragedies on at least a dozen occasions, including the 2012 murders at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and this past summer's killings at African-American church in Charleston, S.C. Other countries have mental health issues, but none have the kind of gun violence the United States does, Obama said. The president mocked opponents of gun control legislation, including those who say the solution is ""more guns"" or fewer safety laws. ""Does anybody really believe that?"" Obama said. Given the frequency of mass shootings, Obama said people should demand action at the federal and state levels, and make it an issue at election time.

Obama pressured news outlets and networks to publicize the statistics of Americans ""who have been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence.""

""The notion that gun laws don't work or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, it's not borne out by the evidence,"" the president said. ""We know that other countries in response to one mass shooting have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours, Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.""

""What's also routine, of course, is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama declared.

""I would... have news organizations put up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side on your news reports,"" Obama wished.

""This won't be information coming from me,"" he declared. ""It will be coming from you."""

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114756259/0/phoenix/nation~Obama-Our-thoughts-and-prayers-are-not-enough/,"WASHINGTON — A visibly frustrated President Obama offered condolences to the victims of the mass shooting at an Oregon college on Thursday, but he added that ""our thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" and voters should demand changes to the nation's gun laws. Having now spoken after more than a dozen senseless killings during his administration, Obama again called for ""common sense"" legislation aimed at preventing gun violence, and he mocked opponents of past initiatives he has pushed. USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war ""Each time this happens, I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said during emotional remarks in the White House press room. ""Each time this happens, I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" Obama noted that he has been to Roseburg, Ore., where the shooting took place, and ""there are really good people there"" who are the latest victims of gun violence. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" Throughout his presidency, especially after shootings, Obama has called for legislation to try to stop gun violence, including enhanced background checks, an assault weapons ban, and improved mental health programs. On this occasion, the president said, ""it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm to get his or her hands on a gun."" As he echoed those calls in the wake of the Oregon shooting, Obama predicted that statements of opposition from gun rights groups were already being written. Many of those opponents will accuse him politicizing tragic shootings, the president said. ""Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" He later said: ""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America."" Oregon officials said a 20-year-old man killed at least 10 people in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Obama visited the city during his 2008 presidential campaign. Obama has spoken in the wake of shooting tragedies on at least a dozen occasions, including the 2012 murders at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and this past summer's killings at African-American church in Charleston, S.C. Other countries have mental health issues, but none have the kind of gun violence the United States does, Obama said. The president mocked opponents of gun control legislation, including those who say the solution is ""more guns"" or fewer safety laws. ""Does anybody really believe that?"" Obama said. Given the frequency of mass shootings, Obama said people should demand action at the federal and state levels, and make it an issue at election time. He also said lawful gun owners should question whether gun rights organizations are truly representing their views when it comes to efforts to prevent violence. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,"" Obama said.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/qVY_ryOk2tw/," On Thursday afternoon, President Obama held a press conference to address the mass shootings that took place on the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Ore. Obama addressed the media with a request for voters. He referenced prior mass shootings in America — the most recent being the theater shooting in Lafayette, La. — and he expressed his sadness at how these shootings (and his subsequent place on the podium) have become “routine”: “As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I say each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America … next week, or a couple of months from now.” Obama paid tribute to the families and loved ones whose lives have been changed forever” in Oregon. He also called for changes in gun laws: “We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ‘The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient, common sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings. And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.” Within his speech, Obama warned that his opponents would accuse him of using the Oregon tragedy to meet an agenda, and he’s okay with it: “This is something we should politicize. This is a political choice that we make.” (Via USA Today) "

Another shooter police say is ""deceased."" Another death toll that — no matter what the number — leaves you with a sick feeling in your gut. It's a painful story that's far too familiar — especially in 2015. The school year was off to an especially violent start even before Thursday’s senseless shooting at an Oregon community college: Just since August, there have been three shootings at college campuses across the nation. And as the details of the tragedy at Umpqua Community College emerge, that awful, familiar feeling of sadness and helplessness takes hold again and we ask ourselves — again — When will the killings end? Swiping is so yesterday Ready or not, it's time to chip in. So to speak. Thursday marked a milestone in the effort to shift the U.S. to the use of microchip-embedded credit cards, a more secure alternative to the old cards that require the swipe of a magnetic stripe. Don't have your fancy new card? Don't worry. The October deadline is more a call to action for retailers than a cutoff. Stephanie Ericksen, Visa's VP of risk product, explains: ""We know, based on experience in other countries, it takes several years to get to critical mass. So we're seeing Oct. 1 as more of a kickoff toward increasing the momentum toward chip. People will still be able to use their (cards with) magnetic stripes."" Good to know. Because many retailers don't have the chip-card readers. Whatcha gonna do, Joaquin?

Now the storm is heading north. The National Hurricane Center says Joaquin could graze the East Coast over the weekend — or it could go out to sea. Regardless of how close Joaquin comes, torrential rain from a separate weather system is forecast to drench much of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with catastrophic flooding possible in the Carolinas and Virginia.

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/10/obama_on_oregon_school_shootin.html," Gallery: Oregon School Shooting - Obama Speaks President Barack Obama, in what he said has become ""routine,"" addressed the nation Thursday in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College and urged the American public and lawmakers around the country to take action. ""Somehow this has become routine,"" Obama said during a nearly 13 minute speech. ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."" ""We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,"" Obama said. ""It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun."" The shooting at the Roseburg campus left 10 people dead and seven wounded, officials confirmed during a late-afternoon news briefing. Obama already this year has given national statements in response to the movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana, and the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre. Obama this time said that the nation's grief isn't enough. ""But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we have one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel."" The president urged the Americans and Congress to take action on ""sufficient common sense gun safety laws."" He also directly addressed the gun lobby for what he predicted will draw comments that he is once again politicizing the issue. ""Well, this is something that we should politicize,"" Obama said. ""It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic."" He added: ""We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" Obama, who is nearing the end of his second term, said the nation is going to have to change its laws. ""That is not something I can do by myself,"" he said. He closed with a prayer for Roseburg family and friends and a somber note. ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I cannot guarantee that, and that is terrible to say."" He then took a long pause. ""And it can change."" Below is a full transcript of Obama's speech: There's been another mass shooting in America. This time in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families, or their children. I've been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there. I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today. Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we've offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs for as long as they need. In the coming days we'll learn about the victims. Young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard with their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who is grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America. Next week, or a couple of months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did. And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds. Regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. You know earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ""The United States of America is the only advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings."" And later that day, there was a mass shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day. Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press release is being cranked out. ""We need more guns,"" they'll argue. ""Fewer gun safety laws."" Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country, they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws, including the majority of responsible, law abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And of course what's also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, ""Obama politicized this issue."" Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic. I would ask news organizations, because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade, and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports. This won't be information coming from me, it will be coming from you. We spent over a $1 trillion and passed countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be? This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We, collectively, are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we worked to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them, to reduce auto fatalities. We have seat belt laws because we know it saves lives So the notion that gun violence is somehow difference, that our freedom and our constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and everything do everything that they do under such regulations, doesn't make sense. So tonight as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat, or a Republican, and an Independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. And I would particularly ask America's gun owners who are using those guns -- properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that suggests its speaking for you. And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up. Each time this happens I'm going to say we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress, and I've got to have state legislatures, and governors, who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out, again, during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that, and that is terrible to say. And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May he bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back, and may he give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/florida-universities-outline-response-to-emergencies-like-oregon-mass/2248022,"After nine people were killed Thursday by a gunman who also killed himself at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, the Tampa Bay Times asked university police departments across the Tampa Bay area and Florida to explain how they would handle an active shooter situation and other emergencies on campus. UCF police Chief Richard Beary said they have a ""layered"" response to on-campus emergencies. In addition to indoor and outdoor sirens, Beary said, students and staff receive text, email and automated phone alerts. UCF police also have their own 911 dispatch center. The alert system can be activated by most all campus supervisors and doesn't require approval from the chain of command. All campus police officers also carry tourniquets, quick-clot bandages and military-grade field dressings to treat gunshot wounds. In case of an emergency, UF students and staff receive alert text and email messages. Loudspeakers on campus also broadcast the alert, and any campus supervisor can activate the notification system. UF police Chief Linda Stump-Kurnick also likes to remind staff and students to always be aware of their surroundings. ""How would you get out (in an emergency), and what would you do?"" Stump-Kurnick said she asks students and staff. ""Nobody can make that decision for you."" In the event a gunman were to open fire on campus, alerts would be sent through text messages as sirens blared warnings to student and staff. Confirmed information also would be bannered across digital displays and featured prominently on the university website. ""As a police department on campus, we are fully sworn, trained and certified and capable of handling almost any situation,"" said Chris Daniel, USF's assistant police chief. One group meets annually to discuss safety measures at the urban campus near downtown Tampa. Another group meets weekly to discuss emergency response plans, particularly in an active shooter scenario. Emergency text messages and emails are sent to students and staff, and audio alerts are broadcast across public address systems that are in all but three residence halls. The UT campus does not have an outdoor PA system. Anyone connected to the university network also will see emergency notifications on their campus computers. They also may opt to receive the alert on personal laptops. ""For a campus like UT, we really welcome in the outside world,"" said Linda Devine, vice president for operations and planning. ""So, we're not immune from violence. We have in place a number of emergency communications tools."""

All those memories came flooding back after a gunman opened fire at the school on Thursday, killing at least nine people before dying in a shootout with police. ""It's a very small community,"" Guthrie said of the town where he was born and lived until he was 12. ""My mom spent time there. I don't remember — I was so young — if she was going to school there or if she was helping out there, but my brothers and I used to go swimming there at the swimming pool that you can see in those aerial photos. We used to watch basketball games there for the local team."" Another tragic shooting. This one hits home being from Roseburg.

He stayed in Oregon after he moved and visited his hometown often for sporting events. He said he heard about the mass shooting when an old friend sent him a text message to express his sadness. ""You keep them in your prayers and just hope that at some point in time, we, as a society, and as people, can learn to cope with struggles and difficulties and challenges in our lives in a different way,"" Guthrie said before the Royals played the Chicago White Sox. ""We obviously all have the ability to go out and do harm, whether it's with a gun or whether it's through other forms of violence, that's never the answer,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we've seen too many people resort to that in recent times. All of us go through struggles; all of us have our challenges. Maybe we can show a little more love and compassion to those who are going through other things. Hopefully the end result is that we can stop having to witness these types of tragedies.""

Police have confirmed that 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer opened fire on the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Oregon. Multiple witnesses at the scene claim that Harper-Mercer made victims lay on the ground before having them stand up one-by-one and answer a question about their religious affiliation. The gunmen allegedly shot all followers of Christianity in the head while those who did not proclaim the Christian faith were shot in the leg.   The Blaze reports that victims of the Oregon shooting are proclaiming that Chris Harper-Mercer was specifically targeting people of Christian faith in his rampage on the Umpqua Community College campus. Bodhi Looney posted her grandmother's account of the shooting on Twitter which outlined that all Christians were shot in the head while those who denied being Christian or remained silent were shot in the leg.  — Bodhi (@BodhiLooney) October 1, 2015  — Bodhi (@BodhiLooney) October 1, 2015  Though the motive of the Oregon community college shooting is currently unknown, it appears that Harper-Mercer had an infatuation with mass shootings. Just three days ago, the gunman downloaded This World Surviving Sandy Hook, a 2015 BBC Documentary documentary covering the horrifying elementary school shooting. In addition to watching the Sandy Hook movie, the deranged killer also proclaimed his admiration for Vester Flanagan, the ex-reporter who gunned down two of his former colleagues on live television.   It also appears that the gunman may have posted an anonymous 4chan thread about his intentions before the shooting took place. The 4chan thread, which appeared in an anonymous forum, notes that people living in the northwest should not go to school tomorrow as he had something planned. The thread began by noting that ""some of you guys are alright"" and not to go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. Many people on the forum encouraged the anonymous user and even gave him tips on how to pull of the shooting. Some even gave suggestions that sound eerily familiar to what witnesses described at the scene at the Oregon college shooting. Following news of the shooting, it seems that many on the message board believe that the anonymous user was actually Chris Harper-Mercer and that he actually followed through with his plan. Some even seemingly praised the OP for following through with his plan.   Now, according to The Verge, the FBI is investigating the thread in an attempt to determine if Harper-Mercer was the poster in question. The 911 dispatcher recordings from the horrifying scene reveal that police exchanged gunfire with the shooter before he was eventually shot down. The dispatcher called the shooting a ""major trauma"" and police were heard in the recording saying it was a mass casualty event with upwards of 20 victims, with approximately 15 deceased.

Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin was one of hundreds of sheriffs around the country who in 2013 vowed to stand against new gun control legislation. In a letter to Vice President Joe Biden, he wrote that ""any actions against, or in disregard for our U.S. Constitution and 2nd Amendment . . . would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people."" USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war Hanlin wrote the letter after the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six staff members dead. He wrote that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions ""offending the constitutional rights of my citizens."" ""It is my position as sheriff of Douglas County, Oregon, that I will refuse to participate in, nor tolerate enforcement actions against citizens that are deemed unconstitutional,"" he told Biden. Hanlin registered his opposition this year as state lawmakers considered requiring background checks on private, person-to-person gun sales. Hanlin told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate wouldn't prevent criminals from getting firearms. He said the state should combat gun violence by cracking down on convicted criminals found with guns, and by addressing people with unmanaged mental health issues. At an evening press conference following Thursday's shootings at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon, Hanlin told the media that he would never utter the name of the killer and he urged reporters not to publish the name of the gunman. A law enforcement official identified the killer to USA TODAY as Chris Mercer, 26. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,"" Hanlin said. ""You will never hear me mention his name. He in no way deserves"" any notoriety. CONTRIBUTING: Associated Press"
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114811469/0/phoenix/nation~Andy-Parker-Ore-shooting-shows-we-are-at-war/,"We are engaged in a war in this country. It is a war between rational, responsible people and self-interested zealots; a war between good and evil. It is a war to decide whether we will continue to let the senseless tragedy of gun violence continue. It is a war to put reasonable safeguards in place to prevent incidents like that which occurred in Oregon yesterday. On one side of that war is a group that is successfully fighting to ensure that a discussion to try to find solutions never takes place. Everyone knows of whom I'm talking: the National Rifle Association. An organization that had at its founding the core mission to teach firearm safety, now has set itself on a course to prevent any laws from being enacted to do just that. And some of our legislators are complicit in this crime. Is the support of a fringe element of the NRA so important that they are willing to accept our children as collateral damage? On the other side are the families and their circles of loved ones whose lives have been shattered by the devastation of gun violence. And every year, 30,000 new families and circles of loved ones are inducted into this fraternity. This is the fraternity my wife, Barbara and I joined almost exactly a month ago. USA TODAY Calculated killing of Christians in Roseburg? Column USA TODAY Ore. shooting: 'I don't even want to know the names yet. I'm not ready' On August 26th, a disturbed gunman shot my daughter Alison on live television. Yesterday another senseless act of gun violence took place in this country. This time ten individuals lost their lives and seven were wounded; 17 families and their circles of loved ones now enter a fraternity they did not choose to join. It is the fraternity of those whose lives have been permanently changed by the brutality of gun violence. I was a Reagan Republican years ago. I have slowly watched the party mutate into something Reagan wouldn't recognize today, with an agenda he would not have supported. Republican legislators across the country refuse to consider common sense measures to prevent the horrific gun violence that kills our loved ones each and every day. By refusing to act, they are aiding and abetting domestic terrorism. POLICING THE USA Policing the USA I am also from Texas and, like many from that state, I believe in the rights guaranteed in the Second Amendment. But with rights come responsibilities. It is not sufficient to say, ""There's nothing you can do to prevent someone, even someone who is mentally ill, from getting a gun if they want it."" Something can be done if we try hard enough. For example, following the tragic 2014 mass shooting in Isla Vista, California passed a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) policy GVRO, a life-saving reform that allows family members and/or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily remove firearms from a loved one in crisis. The parents of the gunman in that case, Elliot Rodger, had requested a welfare check on their son because they believed he was a potential threat. Law enforcement officers did the check, but had no authority to remove Rodgers' firearms from his home. The results were disastrous. Lives were taken for no good reason at all; certainly no reason our Founders would have supported. To California legislators' credit, they wasted no time in taking decisive action to prevent the next tragedy. USA TODAY Brothers in arms - Vester Flanagan, Dylann Roof & Ayoub El-Khazzani: Column Of course we have no way of knowing whether a bill like this would have made a difference in my daughter's case, in the incident yesterday, or in the cases of the almost daily occurrences of gun violence. We don't know if the family was aware of a problem. Nor do we know whether removing firearms would have just prompted him to use something else. But we do know that we must have an open and honest discussion in this country about what we can do as a people to reduce the number of victims of gun violence. Only through engagement in a meaningful and honest dialogue can we hope to find a solution. But I do not underestimate our enemy. We are at war in this country for the answers, and we must win – whatever it takes. Andy Parker lives in Virginia.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114798681/0/phoenix/nation~Column-Shooting-coverage-is-routine-and-thats-the-story/,"Another day, another mass shooting. That’s become literally true; according to the Washington Post, the tragedy today in Roseburg, Ore., brings the total of mass shootings, in which four or more people are killed or injured, to 294. Thursday was the 274th day of the year. Whenever something like this happened, I used to drop what I was doing and monitor media coverage, looking for some kind of meaning. In retrospect, that probably wasn’t the best place to look. And not just because cable news goes into what-it-all-means mode, which quickly gives way to grandstanding and agenda pushing. No, ultimately it was a dead end because there is no meaning. You can’t be inside the head of every shooter. What’s more, you can’t rationally explain why we continue to allow this to happen. We can look to social media, which has supplanted traditional news coverage as the go-to way to experience big events, for clues. But like everything else about the coverage of these events, it’s become predictable, too. USA TODAY Up to 13 killed by shooter at Ore. community college First there is the report of what happened. Details are added as the story develops, some accurate, some not. Things sort out and then the fights begin. Gun-control opponents warn that it’s not a good time to debate laws, it’s too soon to talk about the politics of it all; let’s let the families mourn. That actually worked for a while, but soon gun-control advocates began saying that there is never a good time, so we might as well jump in now. This goes back and forth for a while, President Obama is mentioned — praised or vilified, again predictably depending on your political leanings — and … we move on. We move on. How strange is that? At one time, we might have said this was a coping mechanism. But that’s no longer true. Now it’s just routine. That sounds cold, heartless. But can you name the shooter in any of the more-recent tragedies? Or even where they took place? We aren’t numb to it, exactly. We’re numb to tragedies in the Middle East or Africa. In the United States, at least, we still bother to become outraged enough to tweet a thought or two before going back to whatever else is trending. STATESMAN JOURNAL Obama: 'Our thoughts and prayers are not enough' I’m not a social scientist, but I am an observer of human behavior and I would suggest that any possible scenario in which something like the shooting death of at least 10 people at a community college becomes routine means something is seriously wrong. How do we fix it? Stop making it so easy for disturbed people to get access to guns is a start. But it’s hardly the only solution. Something has to give. We can’t give up on outrage and heartbreak. Not as media, and not as a society. A story like today’s still has to shock us. It still has to move us. And it has to make us do something to stop this insanity. Events become newsworthy in part because they’re rare. They don’t happen every day. Mass shootings do. And that’s a story that has to change.

http://www.ibtimes.com/did-chris-harper-mercer-practice-target-shooting-fbi-working-build-oregons-umqua-2124263,"Chris Harper Mercer, who has been identified as Oregon’s Umpqua Community College shooter, liked to practice target shooting, the 26-year-old’s former neighbors said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Mercer killed at least nine people and wounded seven Thursday at the college in southwest Oregon. Mercer’s ex-neighbors at an apartment complex in Torrance, California, said they had seen him and his mother carry black cases that they suspected contained firearms. The residents of the Arlington Avenue complex recalled, after Thursday’s incident, that they had asked Mercer if he owned guns, but he often deflected. “It's hard to believe,” David Westly, one of the neighbors, told the Los Angeles Times. Another resident, Derrick McClendon, 42, said: ""I wouldn't have suspected him to be a troubled person … I'm surprised and shocked, I really am.” The Los Angeles Times also reported about a MySpace profile of Chris Harper Mercer from Torrance that showed a young man with a barrel of a rifle pointing up into the frame of his portrait. “Me, holding a rifle,” the caption reportedly read. “It was supposed to be all the way in the picture, but it didn't work out.” Mercer’s relative, who did not want to be named, reportedly said that he lived with his mother for “most of his life” in Torrance, and had recently moved to Oregon. The relative described Mercer as “quiet.” According to a law enforcement source, FBI agents in Los Angeles reportedly visited Torrance to interview the people Mercer knew when he lived there a few years ago. Investigators are working to build a profile of Mercer’s history, beliefs and prior behavior, to help determine the motive of the rampage. Religion may have been a motivating factor for Mercer’s actions, the New York Times reported. Mercer, who later died, reportedly asked about people's religion before opening fire at the community college, one witness said. He had four weapons -- three handguns and one rifle, according to reports. It was not clear if Mercer was killed by authorities or took his own life. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official told the New York Times. Residents gathered at a Roseburg, Oregon, park for a vigil for the victims of the deadly mass shooting, with many holding candles as the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" was played, the Associated Press reported late Thursday."

http://www.ibtimes.com/4chan-comments-linked-oregon-shooter-chris-harper-mercer-under-federal-investigation-2124325,"Federal law enforcement officials are actively investigating if comments made on anonymous message board 4chan were linked to Oregon shooter Chris Harper Mercer. Mercer, 26, has been identified as the person responsible for shooting dead at least nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon Thursday. Mercer died during an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement officials on the campus. Soon after the news of the latest mass shooting emerged, people began highlighting a series of comments posted on an obscure forum called r9k of the notorious message board 4chan. The message, posted just after midnight Thursday, read: ""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. So long space robots."" The New York Times reported that federal law enforcement officials said they were examining a conversation on 4chan as well as other social media to try to determine if any of these were linked to Mercer. The message, which is archived here, immediately raised the possibility that the anonymous poster was Mercer. However, given the inherently anonymous nature of 4chan, it is impossible to quickly verify the identity of the person behind the post. Responses to the message encourage the person to carry out the attack with some even giving tips on how to carry out such an attack. ""I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun,"" one of the comments read. In the wake of the shooting, members of r9k forum, which is predominantly made up of people who identify as socially awkward and loners, began trolling media outlets by creating fake profiles to try and trick them into reporting them. The motive behind the shooting is unknown with investigators attempting to piece together any evidence from the people who knew Mercer, including his former neighbors who revealed that he enjoyed target shooting. A MySpace profile of Chris Harper Mercer shows a young man with a barrel of a rifle pointing up into the frame of his portrait with the caption: ""Me, holding a rifle. It was supposed to be all the way in the picture, but it didn't work out.” Following the shooting, President Barack Obama delivered a strong message to the pro-gun lobby, calling once again for more sensible gun laws and tasked the media with highlighting the number of deaths from gun violence compared to terrorism in recent years. ""As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now,"" Obama said."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/2O_wjQjmuVE/,"The Oregon shooter who opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday was armed with five pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines and wore protective body armor, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators also discovered four rifles, two pistols, and a shotgun at the shooter’s home. Although Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin refused to say his name and “give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice,” the shooter was identified by multiple media outlets, citing anonymous law enforcement sources, as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Mercer was reclusive and introverted, according to descriptions based on his online presence and neighbors at the apartment complex where he apparently lived. At a press conference Friday, Hanlin and his team said that all the firearms were purchased legally, some by the shooter and others by a family member. Sheriff Hanlin said there were a total of ten fatalities, including the shooter. Among Mercer’s weapons were a 9mm Glock pistol and a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, according to the report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He also had a .40-caliber pistol that was traced to a different person in Portland. Investigators suspect he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the crime scene shows he purchased textbooks on campus two days before the shooting, according to the AP. Mercer was born in the U.K. before moving to the U.S. at a young age, Carmen Nesnick — whose mother married his father a few years ago — told CBS News Los Angeles. Although she had only met Mercer a few times and last spoke to him a year ago, Nesnick described her stepbrother as “caring and supportive.” Police on Thursday night surrounded the apartment building in nearby Winchester — four miles from the college — that is believed to be Mercer’s place of residence after he moved there from Torrance, Cal. “I just started noticing him the last 4-6 months, there’s a playground out behind the apartments, and we’re on the second story. I go outside to smoke and I watch for anyone,” Steven Fisher, a neighbor, told Reuters. “Around 5-5:30 in the evening I’d see him out there with a couple kids. He seemed skittish, always looking over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching,” Fisher said, adding that he had never spoken to Mercer. Both Fisher and another neighbor said they recognized the young assailant from circulated photographs that appeared on a profile purportedly belonging to him on social network MySpace. The photos show a man with a shaved head and glasses looking into the camera while holding a long-barrel gun. Several other photos on the profile depict masked gunmen and symbols of the Irish Republican Army, while another profile on dating website Spiritual Passions says he “Doesn’t Like Organized Religion” and is “shy at first, but warm up quickly.” The username on the dating profile, IRONCROSS45, is also part of an email address — ironcross45@gmail.com — that has been traced back to Mercer at his Winchester address. There are suspicions that the username may be a reference to a Nazi military symbol, and multiple reports said someone with the same handle had purchased Nazi memorabilia online. The email is also reportedly linked to the profile of one Lithium_Love on torrent-sharing website KickAssTorrents, where a linked blog post talks about Vester Flanagan — the man who gunned down two television journalists on camera in late August. “On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are,” the post reads. “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.” The latest activity on the torrent account was a video uploaded on Tuesday, a BBC documentary about the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 people — most of them children under the age of 10 — lost their lives. Former neighbors from Torrance, where Mercer lived before moving to Oregon, described him as a reserved young man who was almost inseparable from his mother and wore the same outfit (a white t-shirt with green army pants and combat boots) every day. “He always seemed anxious,” 51-year-old Rosario Lucumi, who remembers frequently riding the same bus as him, told the New York Times. “He always had earphones in, listening to music.” Others in the neighborhood said Mercer’s mother, Laurel Harper, would go door-to-door complaining about a variety of nuisances like pet dogs, children playing loudly and cockroaches. She reportedly claimed they bothered her son, who was apparently dealing with “some mental issues.” When Brian Clay, 18, once asked Mercer why he wore “military get-up” all the time, he says he didn’t get a straight answer. “He kind of just didn’t want to talk about it” and quickly changed the subject, Clay told the Times. “He didn’t say anything about himself.” Ian Mercer, the gunman’s father who reportedly divorced Harper in 2006 and now lives in Tarzana, Cal., told reporters outside his residence Thursday night there that he was “as shocked as anybody” at his son’s alleged crime. “I can’t answer any questions right now. I don’t want to answer any questions right now,” he said. “Obviously, it’s been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family.” Write to Rishi Iyengar at rishi.iyengar@timeasia.com."

If I could see a picture of his mom maybe it could jog some memory. I wonder what his experience was like here. This is not a big building. I’m sure we crossed paths at some point.” Lists of Daily Breeze graduates from 2009 showed Harper-Mercer graduated from the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance with four other students. Switzer teaches students with learning disabilities and emotional issues. Records showed they moved to Winchester, Ore., in 2013. Medrano said it was shocking to learn Harper-Mercer shot his victims after asking them if they were Christian. “I wonder what happened in his life that brought him to that point,” Medrano said. “It’s heartbreaking.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

During an early evening appearance in the White House press room, Obama said this latest mass shooting again shows the need to beef up the nation's gun laws. ""Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws,"" Obama said. ""And this is not something I can do by myself,"" he added. ""I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this."""

          / CBS News Heroes and survivors are emerging from Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon that killed 10, including the gunman, and critically injured seven others, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villareal. According to his family, Chris Mintz didn't run away from the gunfire. The army veteran charged towards the gunman instead, trying to protect his classmates. ""Tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming in, gets shot three times, hits the floor, looks up at gunman and says, 'it's my son's birthday today,' gets shot two more times,"" said his aunt, Wanta Mintz. Mintz survived the shooting -- but spent most of the day in surgery. ""His vital signs are okay. He's going to have to learn to walk again but he walked away with his life and that's more than so many other people did,"" said his cousin, Ariana Earnhardt. According to Army records, Mintz served from October 2004 to March 2007 in the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade and the 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis (Joint Base Lewis-McChord), Washington. Records show he earned numerous awards, including a National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and Army Service Ribbon. Student Anastasia Bboylan also survived the shooting but is in critical condition, after a bullet passed near her spine. Her family told CBS News she has movement in her legs. All shooting victims were initially brought to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. Three female patients were then tranposrted north to another hospital in Springfield. Students and community members of the small town gathered at a candlelight vigil for the victims Thursday night, and were still visibly shaken. ""I heard a couple loud noises, our whole class heard them,"" said Angel Ardito. ""I didn't hear any gunshots, I heard screaming,"" said Hannah Lee.

http://www.ibtimes.com/oregon-umqua-community-college-shooting-hate-crime-race-religion-may-have-played-role-2124495,"Oregon’s top federal prosecutor said he and other government officials have heard rumors of ""some sort of race-related manifesto"" connected with Thursday's gunman, the Oregonian reported Friday. Speculation that the shooter, 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, was motivated by hate have gained traction since witnesses have reported that they heard Mercer ask victims about their religion, specifically targeting Christians in a classroom. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” a law enforcement official told the New York Times. The official motive of the shooting remained unknown Friday morning, as investigators began meeting people who knew Mercer. The shooting at Umpqua Community College left at least 10 people dead and injured seven others at the southwest Oregon campus. Mercer was killed in a firefight with law enforcement. Little is known about Mercer, but relatives described the gunman, who reportedly lived with his mother, as quiet. Mercer carried with him three handguns, one rifle and body armor.

One commenter on the message board 4chan seemed to foreshadow the shooting rampage, writing shortly after midnight Thursday: ""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. So long space robots."" The shooting has unleashed a protracted debate over gun violence and regulations in the country. President Barack Obama called for sensible gun laws following the incident Thursday. “As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough,” he said. “It's not enough.”"
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/BjOkbaaiUho/,"President Barack Obama‘s emotional statement Thursday evening marked the 15th time the president addressed the nation in the aftermath of a mass shooting during his time in the White House. But Obama’s message was markedly different from previous incidents, encouraging Americans to politicize the issue to reform the nation’s gun laws. “This is something we should politicize,” Obama said, warning the nation was growing “numb” to the “routine” shootings which don’t occur with such frequency in any other advanced country. At one point, Obama encouraged gun owners to rethink their relationship with the powerful National Rifle Association. The call for new reforms remains a political pipe-dream, especially under Obama’s tenure. But the president’s comments reflected his “fourth quarter” mentality, in which he feels freed from the political limits of re-election that allow him to speak his mind. The détente between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio was always more of a media creation that a reality, but the gloves are now officially off, with the one-time mentor openly criticizing the younger, better-liked, freshman senator. On Thursday, Bush said only time would tell whether Rubio was prepared to be president, drawing a comparison to his sharing Obama’s previous status as a first-term lawmaker. And he’s criticized members of Congress for skipping votes, something Rubio does with proclivity as he travels the country running for president. Bush’s super PAC was caught trying to “track” Rubio at a campaign event, a standard practice when it is looking for footage with which to attack the candidate. Democratic and Republican lawmakers announced an accord on high-profile criminal justice reform legislation Thursday which may be the only substantive legislation to move through the divided Congress in the coming months. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew informed Congress Thursday that the federal government will run out of “extraordinary measures” to work around the debt limit on Nov. 5, weeks earlier than previously predicted.

But honestly this is not a normal situation for me. I haven’t had the time to feel, let alone think, about everything that’s happened. I’m sure that’s true for many people out there. So, right now, we can only express our grief for the people who are lost. I guess I can do what I do best, and that’s try to make people laugh. Let’s do our show.” Ten people were murdered in the shooting, which happened in Roseburg, Oregon. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,” President Barack Obama said in an address about the killings on Thursday night. “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache, grief and anger we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America, next week or a couple of months from now.” Watch Noah discuss the shooting below.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/oregon-shooter-left-behind-online-portrait-of-a-lonely-youth-with-a-grudge/2248046,"As the horrific details of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., slowly came together like a grisly jigsaw puzzle, one crucial piece remained missing. A portrait of the shooter. Federal law enforcement officials identified the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer of the nearby town of Winchester. But information about Mercer remained fragmented as of Friday morning, much of it scattered online like a shredded photograph. His family has so far declined to comment. His father, Ian Harper, told reporters simply that he was ""shocked"" by the news of his son's acts. Many of the scraps of information about Mercer uncovered so far by the media did not fit together easily and there was no immediate way to be sure that the various social media and Internet utterances and postings that appeared to come from him actually did. WATCH THE VIDEO: Shooter's family in shock Mercer was mixed race, according to an Internet dating profile that appeared to come from him, yet his email address referenced an iron cross, a symbol often associated with Nazis. He described himself as a ""lover,"" but posed with guns and posted photos glorifying violence. But two things are increasingly clear. Mercer was a quiet, withdrawn young man who struggled to connect with other people, instead seeking attention online or, ultimately, through violence. ""Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight,"" he wrote in a blog expressing admiration for Roanoke, Va., shooter Vester Flanagan, according to the Daily Beast. And for reasons unknown, he apparently bore a deadly grudge against organized religion. ""Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual"" he wrote on one dating website, also listing membership in a group called ""Doesn't Like Organized Religion."" On Thursday morning, those two aspects of his personality apparently drove Mercer to go on a rampage, shooting at least 16 people at Umpqua Community College, killing nine and injuring seven. According to survivors, Mercer asked his hostages if they were Christians. ""The shooter was lining people up and asking if they were Christian. If they said yes, then they were shot in the head. If they said no or didn't answer, they were shot in the legs,"" a witness said in a text message to the Roseburg Beacon News, according to its publisher. Yet, the picture of Mercer remains murky. Some of the confusion is deliberate. During a press briefing Thursday evening, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin refused to name Mercer, saying that doing so would ""give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice."" Hanlin appeared to be referencing a growing movement that argues against naming mass shooters. Survivors and victims' family members believe naming the culprits only encourages copycats. Little is known about Mercer, who records show moved to the Roseburg area with his mother in 2013. He was born in the United Kingdom and came to the United States as a young boy, his stepsister Carmen Nesnick, told CBS Los Angeles. Mercer moved to California, where he attended the Switzer Center. The school in Torrance serves ""students from 3rd grade to 22 years of age who have moderate to severe learning disabilities, emotional issues, attention problems and behavioral disorders,"" according to the Switzer Center's Web site. A graduation ad printed in the Daily Breeze, the local newspaper for Los Angeles County's South Bay region, lists a ""Chris Harper-Mercer"" as a member of the Switzer Center's class of 2009. Rick Rada, a classmate who graduated from the school the same year as Mercer, spoke to the Washington Post over the phone late Thursday evening. ""To me Chris was just an ordinary guy, really,"" Rada said. Rada would not say if Mercer had a learning disability or behavioral disorder, but he said his classmate ""was one of the silent types, like me."" ""Everyone in the school knew who each other was,"" said Rada, who, with Mercer, was part of a graduating class of just five people. ""Some made fun of others, others made fun of others. You know?"" Despite being a silent kid, Mercer could be coaxed into opening up, Rada said. ""He opened up with the teachers, talked to them, had fun,"" he said. Mercer was ""smart"" and could be ""cheerful"" at times, Rada said. But Mercer also had a harder streak. ""He actually broke up a couple of fights back in those days,"" Rada said. ""A certain female student would have a problem with a male student. He would step in and defend them."" Rada occasionally saw Mercer at Switzer's annual reunions. The last time they spoke was at a reunion several years ago, where Rada noticed nothing out of the ordinary. ""I saw him and said 'Hey what's up?' And he said 'Oh, good.' After that we just went on with the event and went our separate ways,"" Rada told the Post. ""I don't really know why he did what he did."" That portrait of Mercer as a quiet guy capable of violence is backed up by online profiles that appear to belong to the gunman. They sketch out an image of a young man who struggled to connect with people in real life, so he reached out online. ""Looking for someone who shares my beliefs, and is similar to me,"" he wrote on a dating profile on a website called Spiritual Passions. The profile hints at Mercer's social anxiety. ""Shy at first, but warm up quickly, better in small groups,"" he wrote. Under ""personality,"" he wrote: ""lover, conservative, professional, intellectual, introvert."" Mercer wrote that he was looking for ""romance, soulmate, conversation, miss right now, the yin to my yang, dating, penpal, friends only, relationship, miss right."" The profile, apparently created while he was living in California, listed his musical interests as ""Industrial, Punk, Rock"" and said that he didn't drink or do drugs. But that same profile also hinted at darker interests. He favored horror movies along with other cinematic genres, it said. And under hobbies, Mercer wrote ""killing zombies"" along with ""internet"" and other pursuits. Under food, he added ""Always Dieting, BRAINS!!!"" And in the clearest foreshadowing of Thursday's attack, the profile stated that Mercer was ""Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual"" and belonged to a group called ""Doesn't Like Organized Religion."" Another account, also linked to his email account, showed similar interests. ""I'm 20 years old, in college, I like to listen to music, mostly goth/punk/industrial/electronic, and I love to watch movies,"" he wrote on a website called Morgue Penpals. ""Horror movies are the best, but i also like some action films, depending on the type, and I like crime dramas as well."" A clearer glimpse into Mercer's mindset ahead of Thursday's attack comes from his MySpace account. An account associated with the same email address features photographs of him holding a rifle alongside posters for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). One of the images is a magazine cover from an Irish newspaper with the headline ""British army could not defeat IRA."" Another poster, depicting black-and-white armed figures wearing balaclavas, quotes hunger-striker Bobby Sands: ""They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken."" But the starkest sign that something was wrong appeared in a blog that praised Roanoke shooter Vester Flanagan. According to the Daily Beast, the blog was linked to Mercer's email address. ""I have to say, anyone who knew him could have seen this coming,"" the blogger, identified by the Daily Beast as Mercer, wrote. ""People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned him."" ""On an interesting note,"" the blog continues ominously, ""I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. . . A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" Neighbors in both California and Oregon said they saw signs of a militaristic bent and angry attitude from Mercer. His head was shaved and he wore military-style green pants with black boots, neighbors told the Los Angeles Times and New York Times. Several neighbors said they had seen Mercer and his mother carrying black cases that appeared to hold firearms while living in Torrance. When neighbors asked him about the weapons at a community BBQ, Mercer didn't respond but said he enjoyed going target shooting, neighbor David Westly told the Los Angeles Times. Torrance residents told the newspaper that Mercer and his mother, a nurse, were quiet people who kept to themselves. ""She would go around knocking on neighbor's doors,"" Rosario Lucumi told the Times. ""She would call him 'baby' all the time. I thought it was strange because he was an adult."" ""He was always moving around"" as if unsettled, Lucumi said. ""It's like he was always anxious or nervous,"" added her daughter, Rosario Espinoza. On one occasion, Mercer's mother went door-to-door with a petition to get the landlord to exterminate cockroaches. ""She said, 'My son is dealing with some mental issues, and the roaches are really irritating him,'"" Julia Winstead told the New York Times. ""I never saw him with friends or a girlfriend,"" another neighbor, Derrick McClendon, told the Los Angeles Times. ""He was bashful and timid."" Neighbors in Winchester described a similarly agitated young man, but angrier. ""He yelled at us, me and my husband,"" Bronte Hart, told the New York Times. ""He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone."" She told the Associated Press that Mercer would ""sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" Hart said that a woman she believed to be Mercer's mother lived with him and was ""crying her eyes out"" Thursday. Steven Fisher, another Winchester neighbor, described Mercer as ""skittish."" ""His demeanor, the way he moved, always looking around,"" Fisher told CNN. ""I got a bad vibe from him."" ""He was a little odd, like sensitive to things,"" Rebecca Miles, who took a theater class at UCC with Mercer, told CNN. It's still unclear how those elements - anxiety, loneliness, a distaste for religion and a taste for guns - added up to an alleged killer. A hint could lie on the anonymous web forum 4chan. A message was posted on Wednesday night warning: ""Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest."" ""Some of you guys are alright,"" the anonymous user wrote. ""so long space robots."" On Thursday afternoon, the thread was flooded with responses. ""THE MADMAN ACTUALLY DID IT,"" one wrote. Authorities are now investigating the threat, according to the New York Times. It's unclear if the anonymous warning actually came from Mercer, a young man who apparently felt more comfortable sharing online than he did in real life. But Mercer's actions matched the carnage predicted on the message board. On Thursday morning, the misfit interrupted a class at UCC's Snyder Hall, wearing a dark shirt and jeans and spewing bullets from multiple guns. Students told of hiding between desks and huddling in darkness as the shooter methodically sought out victims. ""There's a shooter! Run! Run! Get out of there!"" groups of students screamed as they ran out of the building. Some hid under cars or tried to hold shut classroom doors. Witnesses told Roseburg's local paper, the News-Review, and CNN that Mercer asked students in the classroom he entered to stand up and state their religion. According to CNN, victim Anastasia Boylan told her father before she went into surgery that Mercer said to the students who identified as Christian, ""'Good, because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second.'"" Mercer was killed in a shootout with police. Four guns were recovered from the crime scene, including three pistols and a type of semiautomatic rifle, people familiar with the investigation told the Post. A law enforcement official told CNN that the shooter had body armor with him and had enough ammunition for a prolonged gunfight. Mercer's family has so far been tight-lipped about the atrocity. Ian Harper, the suspect's father, briefly stepped outside of his Los Angeles home Thursday night and spoke with the Los Angeles Times. He said he couldn't answer any questions about his son or the shooting. ""Shocked is all I can say,"" he said. ""It's been a devastating day."""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114906611/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~mass-shootings-speeches-How-Obama-has-responded/,"WASHINGTON — A visibly angry President Obama gave perhaps his most forceful speech on gun violence yet on Thursday, noting that it wasn't his first speech in response to a mass shooting and probably wouldn't be his last.

All of Obama's remarks in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting have some commonalities: extending ""thoughts and prayers"" to the victims families, offering the help of federal law enforcement and emphasizing that the details of what happened are still developing. But most of them made no mention of guns as a root cause of the violence. A turning point was 2012, when 20 children and six teachers were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Obama created a commission on gun violence, and took some executive actions, but Congress failed to strengthen laws on the background checks. A look what Obama said, and when, on mass shootings over the years: ""My immediate thoughts and prayers are with the wounded and with the families of the fallen, and with those who live and serve at Fort Hood. And these are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk and at times give their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis. It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil."" ""Gabby Giffords was a friend of mine. She is not only an extraordinary public servant, but she is also somebody who is warm and caring. She is well liked by her colleagues and well liked by her constituents. Her husband Mark Kelly is a Navy captain and one of America's valiant astronauts. It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does: listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors. That is the essence of what our democracy is all about. That is why this is more than a tragedy for those involved. It is a tragedy for Arizona and a tragedy for our entire country."" ""Even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved, and they were loved. They were mothers and fathers. They were husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future, and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled. ""And if there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited, and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, it's not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately, it's how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another."" ""I think all of us recognize that these kinds of terrible, tragic events are happening with too much regularity for us not to do some soul searching and to examine additional ways that we can reduce violence. .. ""We don't yet know fully what motivated this individual to carry out this terrible act. If it turns out, as some early reports indicate, that it may have been motivated in some way by the ethnicity of those who were attending the temple, I think the American people immediately recoil against those kinds of attitudes, and I think it will be very important for us to reaffirm, once again, that in this country, regardless of what we look like, where we come from, who we worship; we are all one people, and we look after one another, and we respect one another."" ""We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a President, but as anybody else would: as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. ""The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams."" ""So we are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital. It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel. These are men and women who were going to work, doing their job protecting all of us. They're patriots, and they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn't have expected here at home."" ""Any shooting is troubling. Obviously, this reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood five years ago. We know these families. We know their incredible service to our country and the sacrifices that they make. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers were — are with the entire community. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure that the community at Fort Hood has what it needs to deal with the current situation, but also any potential aftermath. ""We're heartbroken that something like this might have happened again. And I don't want to comment on the facts until I know exactly what has happened, but for now, I would just hope that everybody across the country is keeping the families and the community of Fort Hood in our thoughts and in our prayers. The folks there have sacrificed so much on behalf of our freedom. Many of the people there have been on multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. They serve with valor, and they serve with distinction. And when they're at their home base, they need to feel safe."" ""That this occurred now — as Jews were preparing to celebrate Passover, as Christians were observing Palm Sunday — makes this tragedy all the more painful. And today, as Passover begins, we're seeing a number of synagogues and Jewish community centers take added security precautions. Nobody should have to worry about their security when gathering with their fellow believers. No one should ever have to fear for their safety when they go to pray."" ""Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church. We knew their pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night. And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their community doesn't say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel. Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship. ""We don't have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun."" ""My main message right now is obviously the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four marines that have been killed. It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion. And although the families are still in the process of being contacted, I want them to know that I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences and knowing that they have their full support — our full support as they try to overcome the grief that's involved here."" ""There's been another mass shooting in America, this time in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever. ... ""We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. ""And what's become routine, of course, is the response to those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: 'We need more guns,' they'll argue, 'fewer gun safety laws.' Does anybody really believe that? ... ""And of course, what's also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' This is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.... ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. And it can change."""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114909861/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~James-Alan-Fox-Umpqua-shooting-a-tragedy-not-a-trend/,"Another mass shooting sears deep into the collective consciousness of the American people. Another school — this time a community college in an otherwise peaceful town in rural Oregon — is devastated by a young man taking aim at students trapped in classrooms. Nine are murdered, and many others wounded, before the gunman is killed in a shootout with the police. Within a few hours, President Obama appeared before the camera, reinforcing the notion that America is under siege. “Somehow this has become routine,” noted Obama with obvious emotion. “The reporting is routine.” USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war POLICING THE USA Policing the USA Although the sense of urgency may be overstated, Obama is certainly correct about the almost formulaic media response. The Oregon shooting had countless news outlets flooding the airwaves and the Internet with questionable statistics on the incidence of mass shootings along with sidebar listings of the deadliest shooting sprees in U.S. history. In the usual rush to offer up some breaking information, news reports were embellished with unconfirmed details about the massacre and the assailant that did little but fuel a contagion of fear. For context, media folks reminded us of the unforgettable, high profile shootings that have taken place over the past few months, hinting of a problem that has grown out of control. They lumped together rather different types of incidents (the hate-inspired church killing in Charleston, the random shooting at a Louisiana movie theater in which two victims were slain, and the targeted killing of two employees of a Virginia television station by a disgruntled former co-worker seeking payback for perceived mistreatment) as if there is a pattern emerging. USA TODAY FBI report: Violent and property crime down slightly in 2014 Further adding to the state of alarm and confusion, headlines featured scary yet conflicting statistics from various sources. By reducing the standard threshold in defining a mass shooting (four or more killed by gunfire, not including the perpetrator), the incidence can reach incredible proportions. For example, the “Mass Shooting Tracker” website redefines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people (including the assailant) are shot, but not necessarily killed. By this criterion, there have been nearly 300 thus far this year. Notwithstanding the sadness caused by each of these tragedies, nothing has really changed in term of risk. One can take virtually any period of months or years during the past few decades and find a series of shootings that seemed at the time to signal a new epidemic. The ‘80s were marked by a flurry of deadly postal shootings, which gave rise to the term “going postal.” The ‘90s witnessed a string of mass shootings in middle and high schools carried out by alienated adolescents with access to borrowed guns, prompting the venerable Dan Rather to declare an epidemic of school violence. More recently, the “active shooter” has become the new boogeyman armed with a gun. Of course, there were shootings in public places long before this frightening catchphrase was created. Nowadays, any time someone shows up with a gun in a school, a church, a movie theater, a shopping mall or a restaurant, twitter becomes alive with messages of alarm. I certainly don't mean to minimize the suffering of the Oregon victims and their families, but the shooting spree is not a reflection of more deadly times. Consider the facts. According to a careful analysis of data on mass shootings (using the widely accepted definition of at least four killed), the Congressional Research Service found that there are, on average, just over 20 incidents annually. More important, the increase in cases, if there was one at all, is negligible. Indeed, the only genuine increase is in hype and hysteria.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/02/oregon-college-shooting-guns-kill-people-in-us-pervert-second-amendment,"Our founding fathers put the right to bear arms in the US Constitution to protect us. Now we must protect our country from those who misuse it Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST America’s gun violence, like our grief in Oregon, seems to know no bounds, no limits, no end. The reason is deadly simple: our very lives are chained to a constitutional amendment that is willfully misinterpreted by many and perverted by gun rights advocates for political ends.  That sullied amendment is the United States constitution’s Second Amendment which states, “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” The gun industry and its supporters have turned that simple statement into a clever marketing tool, and Americans are paying the price in blood. On Thursday, Roseburg, Oregon – a three-hour drive south of the Oregon’s largest city, Portland – was rocked by a deadly mass shooting that wounded seven people and took the lives of 10 others, including the gunman. Students were in classes at Umpqua Community College when a 26-year-old gunman shattered their world when he opened fire on them. They are, sadly, not unique: hardly a week has passed in the last three years without a mass shooting. For 15 years, Ceasefire Oregon has fought the gun lobby – and people like Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin, the gun rights advocate who is investigating this latest shooting – and worked to pass reasonable, effective gun laws. Hanlin is one of many who claim that the answer to gun violence is to help those who have mental health problems while the rest of us stock up on guns and ammo. Hanlin, gun extremists and groups like the National Rifle Association have scapegoated people with mental health problems for years – but they know that such people are far more likely to be victims of violence than the perpetrators of it (and far more likely to kill themselves than other people). Gun rights advocates also claim that we need more guns to protect ourselves from gun violence. But with 310m firearms in the US, and despite the fact that one in every three Americans owns guns, more guns are not making us safer. After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, we at Ceasefire Oregon worked with Moms Demand Action, Everytown for Gun Safety, Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership, the Brady Campaign and the Oregon Alliance for Gun Safety to pass a background check law despite opposition from a few Democratic legislators and a few Oregon sheriffs, including Hanlin. And, after years of work, Oregon finally passed a bill requiring background checks for almost all gun sales last spring. But gun violence is a cancer in our nation and, just as no single drug will cure all cancers, no single gun law will cure all gun violence. Rather, we need comprehensive, effective legislation and caring, courageous leadership to change both America’s laws and Americans’ views on guns and gun violence. Too often, gun control advocates hear that nothing can be done to change things in this country, but that’s just not true. Gun violence prevention researchers and advocates know that we can reduce gun violence by passing effective, common-sense laws, like background checks for all gun sales to stop criminals and those with demonstrated mental health issues and histories of violence from buying guns. Waiting periods between the time of gun purchase and possession can provide purchasers with a cooling-off period to help deter homicide and suicide. Instituting gun violence restraining orders can reduce violence by allowing family members and law enforcement to remove a gun from a loved one who is exhibiting warning signs of violence. We can require – or at least heavily incentivize through liability statutes – that firearms be kept secured at all times with trigger locks or in a safe. We can reduce gun trafficking by allowing people to purchase only one gun per month. We can reinstate the federal assault weapons ban to ban the purchase and possession of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles, which are not necessary for the most dedicated home-defender or hunter. And Americans can refuse to support lawmakers of any party who do not support “gun-sense” laws – like background checks, higher standards for gun ownership and funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms – at the ballot box. We can challenge all 2016 presidential candidates to issue a plan to cut gun violence by 50% before 2020 (the final year of the next president’s first term in office), and Ceasefire has done so. We are citizens of a great nation, but our children, our mothers, our fathers and our friends are being mowed down, fed to the gun industry’s insatiable appetite for profit. Our founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect our country. Now we must protect our country from those who pervert the Second Amendment. We know this can be done. We know this must be done. Our national nightmare of paying into the gun lobby’s profit machine must be brought to an end."

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-oregon-shooting-huppke-20151002-story.html,"Here are a few facts: • Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people and wounded nine others at a community college in Oregon. • There have been 294 mass shootings — defined as a shooting in which four or more people are killed or wounded — this year. Today is only the 275th day of the year. • The Washington Post calculated that during President Barack Obama's second term, not a single Sunday-to-Saturday calendar week has passed without a mass shooting. The political response to these facts? Prayers for the families of the dead, with many of those prayers disbursed via tweets from politicians' Twitter accounts. Here are some more facts: • A series of undercover videos released this year have attempted to paint the women's health organization Planned Parenthood as a soulless operation that sells the body parts of aborted fetuses to tissue procurement companies for profit. The edited versions of the videos, as well as the full videos that have been released, are disturbing but at no point provide proof that the organization is profiting from fetal tissue donation, which is legal under federal law. • Missouri recently became the sixth state to investigate Planned Parenthood on these allegations and find no evidence of wrongdoing. • Abortions account for 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides, and by law, no federal money can be used to fund those services. • The vast majority of the money Planned Parenthood receives from the government is Medicaid reimbursement for services ranging from breast exams to pregnancy tests to tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Cutting off federal funding would impact those services. The political response to these facts? Outrage, and calls that the government be shut down until Planned Parenthood is defunded. Tweeted prayers in response to mass shootings. A government shutdown in response to disturbing but suspect videos. Taking nothing away from those who oppose abortion, this is a wildly disproportionate response. I'm not saying abortion opponents should temper their passion, not at all. I'm just wondering how it is that certain people and politicians can be so incensed by an act that they view as murder, and so resigned — thinking a head bent down in prayer is action enough — to an act that everyone agrees is murder. People can hold different views on when life begins. But there can be no argument over when the life of a victim of gun violence ends. It ends moments after the gun is fired. If you're willing to shut down the government because you believe the allegations of an activist group with a clear agenda, what are you willing to do when confronted with the indisputable fact that Americans are being indiscriminately gunned down in places they once felt safe? The answer, apparently, is that you're willing to send your prayers out on Twitter. And that, clearly, is not doing a damn bit of good. rhuppke@tribpub.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Cooke apeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" this morning to discuss the president's immediate call for more gun laws following the deadly mass shooting in Oregon yesterday morning.

The debate between Cooke and Bloomberg's Mark Halperin gets heated after Cook stumps Halperin by asking for one specific gun control policy that the U.S. should try.

""I completely agree with the president,"" Halperin said. ""People need to find solutions to this and not talk about what won't work, and why it's so complicated. We can't be the only country in the world that's like this...""

""Then, with respect, what is your plan?"" Cooke asks.

""Finding solutions, short term, in terms of finding legislation, state and federal, coming up with ideas--"" sputters Halperin.

""Which ideas?"" Cooke quickly follows up. 

Halperin gives up the pretense of attempting to come up with ideas: ""I'm not an expert in this field, I'm trying to be civil, not to criticize or attack you, but as I listen to your tone... I want everybody in the country to be saying we need to find solutions, not talk about how complicaed it is... We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity or how the ther side's ideas aren't good.""

""So you don't have any more ideas that I do, we've now established that,"" responds Cooke. ""It is complicated, and it is difficult, and there are no ideas. What I'm suggesting is that Mark Halperin and President Obama and Biden and now you keep saying we need to do something, and that is it. What? ... At least we could have a debate, what is it you are proposing?""

At this point, Howard Dean jumps in to the conversation and proposes making gun sellers liable for selling to potential criminals. 

""And now we can have a debate,"" jokes Cooke.

Transcript (part one) 

CHARLES CW COOKE: There's a difference in saying, ""are we upset? Yes, we are,"" and, ""is the president upset? Yes he is,"" and does the president have the slightest clue to fix this. 

Let's look at what he proposed in the past: universal background checks. Oregon had background checks as you said. 

The argument for universal background checks is that guns can come in from other states, but that is an anti-crime measure. No mass shooter seems to get their guns in any sense that would intersect with private sales. They either buy them from a dealer or get them illegally. 

Obama also wanted a ban on assault rifles, that doesn't seem to have much of an effect either; the shooter had three hand guns...

We have a problem in the United States with stopping contraband. We have never done it effectively. Not during the prohibition, the drug war. If anything, if you look at the way our police attitudes are changing, we're more reluctant to go after people, especially minorities and those more vulnerable, and search them, check them for items, drugs, guns we don't want them to have...

It's not true that the majority of mass killers and serial killers are white. It's equally distributed. What they are always is men. Always young men. What we have in America is a problem with young men killing a lot of people when they get the chance and I think an increasing copy cat problem because at some point someone decided hey, when you're upset with people you feel as if you're alone, you can do this...

It is distributed across all races evenly... but women do not commit these sorts of things...

If we want to focus on one thing, it should be this: Why are young men between 15-30 taking out their anger and sense of isolation on schools and other soft targets. There's a copy cat problem, but there is also a problem with masculinity, which is part of this sort of violence.

Transcript (part two)
MARK HALPERIN:  There's no question this is a difficult problem. I want to engage Charles a little bit in a civil way. 

You know, everyone in the country in a leadership position, journalism, politics, etc. should have a thirst and hunger and passion to try to come up with solutions. To just talk about how other people's solutions won't work, or this is a complicated sociological issue. I don't think that's enough. I completely agree with the vice president. people need to find solutions to this and not talk about what won't work, and it's so complicated. We can't be the only country in the world that's like this...

CHARLES COOKE: Then, with respect, what is your plan?

MARK HALPERIN: Finding solutions, short term, in terms of finding legislation, state and federal, coming up with ideas--

CHARLES COOKE: Which ideas?

MARK HELPERIN: Well, we can talk about specific policies in a minute, but here's a second point. You say part of the issue involves young men. Well, again, public policy people should come up with long term ideas to deal with the question of what is causing young men to do this. 

CHARLES COOKE: So you don't have any more ideas that I do, we've now established that.

HALPERIN: I'm not an expert in this field, I'm trying to be civil, not to criticize or attack you, but as I listen to your tone... I want everybody in the country to be saying we need to find solutions, not talk about how complicaed it is... We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity or how the ther side's ideas aren't good. 

COOKE: It is complicated, and it is difficult, and there are no ideas.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Well what are you saying, no one has the answer? No one can do anything, so let's not do anything. 

COOKE: What I'm suggesting is that Mark Halperin and President Obama and Biden and now you keep saying we need to do something, and that is it. What? ... At least we could have a debate, what is it you are proposing? 

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I agreed with the Vice President, sorry. 

COOKE: He didn't make any proposals.

HOWARD DEAN: I think I can be helpful... First of all, universal background checks might be helpful...

You make the people who sell guns to people who are crazy liable in law suits, criminal prosecutiins, that might help, putting dealers onthe hook... There are ways we can put pressure on people who supply the guns... To make them understand they have some responsibility to who they sell to. 

COOKE: And now we can have a debate."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/hT9mEjuiJ88/,"Taking President Obama’s cue, Democratic lawmakers have seized on Thursday’s deadly shooting at an Oregon’s Umpqua Community College to bring gun control to the forefront of the national conversation. Connecticut Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy announced new legislation Friday morning in Hartford, Connecticut that would bar gun sales until background checks are complete. Currently, if a background check isn’t completed within 72 hours, then a gun can be sold without the check. In what Blumenthal called a “tragic and sad coincidence,” the press conference had been scheduled weeks before Thursday’s shooting in Oregon occurred. Blumenthal compared mass shootings to a public health crisis in the country, and called his bill a “fairly modest” step towards addressing the epidemic. “These commonsense measures closing loopholes can make a difference as a matter of life and death,” he said, noting that 15,729 ineligible people have been able to purchase guns under the current rules once their waiting periods expired. Murphy, who was noticeably incensed as he spoke, took his language a step further. “Congress has become an accomplice in these murders,” he said. “We are quietly endorsing this mass slaughter by refusing to act.” He did not stop there. “I don’t care how many members of Congress send out tweets saying they’re sorry,” he said. “You aren’t sorry, you aren’t truly sympathetic if you’re not willing to act.” The Connecticut Senators were far from the only Democratic lawmakers who wrapped a call for gun control into their condolences after Thursday’s attack. Maryland Senator Ben Cardin put out a statement calling for Congress to “act swiftly on requiring universal background checks for firearms buyers. We must also take steps to strengthen our mental health system and reduce the glorification of violence in our culture. We absolutely should move to ban assault weapons and prohibit high-capacity ammunition clips. The inability to take these small steps is perhaps of one of the greatest failings of Congress.” Other lawmakers were more general in their statements of support for gun control. California Senator Barbara Boxer said, “We cannot close our eyes to this epidemic of gun violence that is erupting in our schools, our workplaces, our movie theaters, our military bases and in our communities. How many more mass shootings must we endure before we take sensible action to address gun violence in this country?” While Nevada Senator Harry Reid said simply: “Americans want us to act. We cannot dodge this conversation forever.” The issue also rose in the race for the Democratic nomination for President. Vermont Senator and 2016 candidate Bernie Sanders said, “We need a comprehensive approach. We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help they need when they need it. We also have to tone down the incredibly high level of gratuitous violence which permeates our media.” In an interview with Boston ABC affiliate WCVB shortly after she had heard of the shooting, former Secretary of State and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said, “I’m sick about it, and I feel an absolute urgency for this country to start being sensible about keeping guns away from people who should not have them. I’m going to be pushing this issue. Universal background checks, a long enough waiting period so that people can’t sneak in under the deadline because the full investigation wasn’t completed.” Former Maryland Governor and 2016 contender Martin O’Malley tweeted: There isn’t any imminent path for gun control legislation to be voted on in Congress. Republican leaders have made clear in the recent past they have no interest in pursuing new legislation. Thursday’s shooting, which claimed ten lives, marked the fifteenth time Barack Obama has addressed a mass shooting during his presidency.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/02/sites-suggest-oregon-gunman-tracked-mass-shootings/,"ROSEBURG, Ore. — The 26-year-old gunman who opened fire in a community college English class, killing nine, was an Army boot camp dropout who studied mass shooters before becoming one himself. A day after the rampage in an Oregon timber town, authorities said Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer wore a flak jacket and brought at least six guns and five ammunition magazines to the school. Investigators found another seven guns at the apartment he shared with his mother. Also Friday, officials released the names, ages and brief biographical information about the nine dead, who ranged in age from 18 to 67 and included several freshmen and a teacher. They were sons and daughters, spouses and parents. One of the freshmen was active in the Future Farmers of America and loved to play soccer. Another was on only his fourth day of college. Grieving families began sharing details of their loved ones. ""We have been trying to figure out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that would take 18 years,"" the family of Lucas Eibel, 18, said in a statement released through the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. Quinn Glen Cooper's family said their son had just started college. ""I don't know how we are going to move forward with our lives without Quinn,"" the Coopers said. ""Our lives are shattered beyond repair."" Nine other people were wounded in the attack, officials said. Harper-Mercer, who died during a shootout with police, was armed with handguns and a rifle, some of which were military grade. The weapons had been purchased legally over the past three years, some by him, others by relatives, said Celinez Nunez, assistant field agent for the Seattle division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Harper-Mercer's social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army, frustrated by traditional organized religion and that he tracked other mass shootings. In one post, he appeared to urge readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues live on TV in August in Virginia, noting ""the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008 In Washington, President Barack Obama lamented the government's inability to pass stricter gun laws even after attacks like the one in Oregon. At a news conference Friday at the White House, Obama said he plans to keep talking about the issue and ""will politicize it"" because inaction is itself a political decision the U.S. is making. He said it's impossible to identify mentally ill people likely to perpetrate mass shootings ahead of time. The only thing the U.S. can do, he explained, is ensure they don't have an arsenal available ""when something in them snaps."" Read Saturday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123009/oregon-has-already-made-gun-control-political-choice,"President Barack Obama was in no mood to merely play ""mourner-in-chief"" on Thursday, after the massacre at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. In his 15th public statement as president after a mass shooting, Obama rebuffed the conservative critics who would soon be accusing him of ""politicizing"" another tragedy by tying it to gun control. “This is something we should politicize,” the president said, his voice edgy with unconcealed frustration and anger. ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America."" The state of Oregon, as it happens, is one of the few that have already heeded Obama's call to make gun control a political issue. In May, thanks to the efforts of gun-control advocates who turned the 2014 midterms into a referendum on gun violence, Oregon became the eighth state in the country to pass a near-universal background check requirement for private gun sales. But while that made the state a rare political success story for gun-control advocates, it's also been a lesson in the severe limits of what incremental, state-level reform can achieve without federal action. In the national wave of support for gun restrictions that followed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, during the 2012 holiday season, Oregon was one of several states that tried to move forward on gun control while Congress remained hopelessly deadlocked. Universal background checks had become the rallying cry of the gun-control movement, and bills passed in Connecticut, New York, Delaware, and Colorado in the months after Newtown. In Oregon, however, a background-check bill stalled for two years, before finally passing in May 2015. What changed? Voters made the kind of choice that Obama recommended yesterday, and booted out the Republican legislators who were blocking it. The bill had been bottled up since 2013 because the entire Republican caucus in the Senate opposed the overhaul, joined by one Democratic swing vote. In an effort to break the deadlock, national gun-control advocates seized upon Oregon’s 2014 mid-term elections as an opportunity. “It was a situation where you saw there was a political pathway in the legislature,” says Mark Prentice, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the advocacy group founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords. Taking a page from the NRA playbook, gun-control groups poured money into the selected legislative races, and the governor's race, to carve out that path to victory. Michael Bloomberg’s group, Everytown for Gun Safety, alone spent $600,000 on campaign donations, advertising, and grassroots organizing to help defeat legislators who opposed the background-check bill; the Oregonian cited Everytown as having helped to turn the tide. Two targeted state senators lost—just enough to give Democrats a sufficient Senate majority to push through the background-check bill this past spring. It was the first major gun-control law to pass in Oregon since 2000, and activists were understandably jubilant. “Today is a day to celebrate,” said Anneliese Davis, an activist from Moms Demand Action, an advocacy group affiliated with Everytown. Gun-control advocates had won by successfully turning Oregon's 2014 elections into a political referendum on gun control—precisely what Obama is urging the rest of the country to do. “When you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision,” he said on Thursday. “If you think this is a problem, you then should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.” The political breakthrough in Oregon was encouragng, to be sure: a glimmer of hope that gun control can work as a political issue. But the scope of what Oregon achieved, even after a pitched and expensive three-year battle, was limited. No one could have reasonably expected the new law to stop Chris Harper Mercer from his violent mission on Thursday, especially so soon after it was enacted, even though there is mounting evidence that background check laws do significantly help to reduce homicides. But these laws can only do so much, and Oregon's gun laws remain lax in many other respects. “They don’t have particularly high standards for gun ownership,"" says Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""They don’t have many types of regulation of gun sellers. They don’t have a permitting process for purchasers."" The state also allows concealed-carry on college campuses, and doesn’t regulate large-capacity ammunition magazines. “Last year, we graded Oregon as a D+, and the background check law probably raises that grade to about a C,” says Lindsay Nichols, a senior attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For those who want to seriously regulate guns in Oregon, there are years of heavy lifting ahead. Even if Oregon's gun-control activists could muster the political will to regulate gun ownership far more thoroughly, the state would run up against a hard reality: The most robust state regulations are no substitute for federal action. The absence of federal regulation has created a spotty patchwork of state laws, for instance, making it easy for traffickers to move weapons from places with lax regulations to those with stricter ones. The story of Oregon's gun-control politics in recent years illustrates the greatest problem gun-control advocates face going forward. The opposition has been practicing ruthlessly effective politics for many decades, and they have constrained the ambitions of gun-control advocates, who have largely focused their attention on politically palatable laws, like background checks. But these laws seek to exclude only narrow classes of people from getting guns; they don't strike at the heart of the problem by reducing the sheer number of guns available to begin with. Until the political landscape changes dramatically, in ways that are hard to foresee even as the country reels from the last example of what loosely regulated guns can lead to, the changes that pass will be necessarily incremental. That creates yet another political obstacle: Pro-gun advocates can use incidents like Thursday's to dismiss the efficacy of gun control in the first place, and make it harder to build momentum for more ambitious measures. The political obstacles have never faded away in Oregon, even in Roseburg itself. Douglas County Sheriff James Hanlin, one of the chief law-enforcement officials responding to Thursday's shooting, has been emblematic of the resistance: He's long been a prominent voice speaking out against the background-check law, and this year joined other Oregon sheriffs in refusing to enforce it. In April 2013, when Vice President Joe Biden was pressing for federal action after the Newtown shootings, Hanlin wrote a letter to Biden, vowing that he would refuse to enforce “unconstitutional” federal gun regulations. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote. The sheriff has yet to address the issue again since Thursday's tragedy. But both sides will be waiting to see how his remarks will shape the only path to gun control—the long, hard, political one.

If they don’t accuse him of that, they might accuse him of making the tragedy about himself. During today’s twelve-minute address, Obama referred to himself 28 times — more than twice per minute! (N.B.: In arriving at this calculation, I included mention of “we” only when he was clearly including himself as part of the plural pronoun; the many uses of “we” in referring to America at large were not included.)

Chris Mintz, 30, a North Carolina native who had moved to the Roseburg, Ore., area and is studying at Umpqua Community College to become a fitness trainer, hurled himself against the door in an effort to stop the gunman, identified as Christopher Harper Mercer, from entering. When Mercer, who killed at least nine people and injured at least seven before being killed by police, shot his way inside, hitting Mintz at least three time, the former soldier called out that it was his son Tyrek’s sixth birthday, according to Mintz’s aunt. His plea was rewarded with two more shots, Wanda Mintz told The Daily Beast. In virtually every mass shooting incident, there are stories of incredible courage — of unarmed men charging shooters, of men shielding loved ones with their bodies — and these stories should give us great hope about the character of our citizens. After all, Chris Mintz did not wake up this morning planning to be a hero. It was just any other day for him, yet his immediate reaction to a shocking, horrifying event was not to flee but to protect. While mass shooters are a tiny few, when they attack their random samples of the American population, there are always people who show courage and resolve. Thankfully, while these acts of courage are often fatal, it looks like Mintz will recover: None of the five shots that hit Mintz struck any vital organs, and he is expected to recover. “His vital signs are OK. He’s going to have to learn to walk again,” cousin Ariana Earnhardt told Q13Fox, “but he walked away with his life and that’s more than so many other people did.” Men have a duty to defend the weak and the vulnerable. Mintz did his duty under the worst possible circumstances. We should all salute him — and pray that we could show similar courage if the worst happens in our own lives.

http://www.opednews.com/articles/Dotting-I-s-and-Crossing-T-by-Deena-Stryker-Bombing_France_Islam_Muslim-151002-828.html,"As US channels concentrate on the latest mass shooting in Oregon, France 24 and Russia's RT cover in detail the meeting in Paris of French, German, Ukrainian and Russian leaders, which was called to discuss Ukraine, but now will be partly devoted to Syria, where Russia has carried out bombing attacks against ISIS to the embarrassment of the Western-led 'coalition'.Elysee Palace courtyard entrance(Image by IAEA Imagebank)   Details   DMCA I've been wondering about French President Francois Hollande's blasts against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, given France's long-standing ties to Syria, which are reflected for example in the fact that the Syria's school system is still modeled on the French, not to mention that both leaders are socialists. It finally occured to me that Hollande is doing what any French socialist President knows he has to do with respect to the US: being more royalist than the king.  While center-right leader Charles de Gaulle was free to behave as obstreperously as he liked, Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist who presided France from 1981 to 1995, set the pattern for a socialist leader to demonstrate his bona fides to Washington by being an impeccable foreign policy ally. Francois Hollande is following suit, even though the fact that Russia now has an independent-minded president recreates a situation similar to the one that held sway during the Cold War, in which France carefully calibrated its alignment with each of the superpowers. The other issue that deserves mention here is the Western  effort to retake a key Afghan city, Kunduz, from the Taliban.  These Islamic fighters have been in the news since we trained them against Russia in the nineties, and fourteen years after we invaded Afghanistan in retaliation for harboring Al Qaeda, they are still successfully fighting the US-installed government.  Though I have not heard it mentioned, isn't it likely that the rise of ISIS has given this group a new lease on life?  Will they not at some point declare their allegiance to the Caliphate, signaling a (momentary) eastern boundary to the entity currently holding areas of Syria and Iraq in the west of the Eurasian continent? Both of these issues point to the reshaping of foreign interventions in the Middle East and Southwest Asia to reflect Russian interests: while the United States' presence on the Eurasian continent is about access to oil, Russia's attitude toward the resulting chaos is primarily about ensuring that the Muslim majority 'Stans' - the countries on its southern rim - remain peaceful.  I've written about President Putin's attitude toward Islam before:	http://otherjonesii.blogspot.com/search?q=Putin+attitude+toward+Islam,  http://otherjonesii.blogspot.com/search?q=Putin+attitude+toward+Islam	, which is to encourage development.  That is why, after careful consideration, he has acted in Syria: when Prime Minister Lavrov declared yesterday in his UN press conference that Russia considers ISIS to be an existential threat he was not referring to a 'recreation of the Soviet Union', but to the need for Russia to maintain close relations with its southern neighbors, a policy that any intelligent leader would pursue. It is being suggested today on US TV channels that President Putin is successfully pursuing a quid pro quo with his Western counterparts at today's Paris meeting: quit accusing us of dark designs on Ukraine (removing the sanctions) while staunch the number of Syrian refugees crowding your beautiful cities by bombing ISIL targets that the US has spared in its determination to remove Assad. Whatever the Russian president does, of fails to do, commentators try to make him look bad.  But while the docile French socialist president feigns support for US policy, the more powerful conservative German Chancellor takes the lead in tilting toward Moscow.  All are players on the Eurasian continent, while the US is two oceans away. P.S. France 24 reported that Francois Hollande came down from the Elysee Palace steps where he usually greets visitors to meet Vladimir Putin in the courtyard, saying ""Welcome President Vladimir"", adding that he had mishandled the Russian President's name: what foreign viewers don't know is that this was Hollande's way of signalling fraternity.  2

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114946707/0/phoenix/opinions~Roberts-Media-blew-it-in-naming-Oregon-mass-murderer/,"This is one of those rare moments (OK, maybe not so rare) when the media blew it. Does the American public have a right to know the name of the loser who marched onto the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon and ended the lives of nine innocent people, injuring seven others? Absolutely, we do. Do we have a need to know this creeper’s name? Nope. As always in the aftermath of the latest inevitable mass shooting, there will be plenty of talk about whether we can do more to keep guns out of the hands of lunatics like this guy. There will some talk about whether we can do more to lock up people who are clearly unhinged. But there will be almost no talk about whether we – the media, I mean, not law enforcement -- have the ability to take away one of what seems to be the prime motivations of mass murderers: Notoriety. This guy posted often on the internet about mass murders and other shootings that make national news. He recently blogged about Vester Lee Flanagan, the nutball who in August killed Virginia TV reporter, Alison Parker, and her cameraman, Adam Ward, before doing the world a favor and killing himself. ""On an interesting note,” he wrote. “I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more your're (sic) in the limelight."" Well, today he’s certainly in the limelight. But I’m not naming him. But I’m not naming him. Of course, reporters, newscasters and bloggers have every right to name him. A few years ago, I'd have argued that we have an obligation to name him. Now, I'm wondering... if members of the media had made a voluntary decision not to name this sick-o in the inevitable wall-to-wall coverage of this tragedy, if we’d decided not to splash his face across every screen, might that do as much (or possibly more?) to avert at least a few of the mass tragedies that headed our way? Think about it. If one of these murdering attention junkies didn’t get any of what they seek -- not so much as a mention and certainly not their names “across the lips of every person on the planet” then they’d have died for nothing. I’m wondering how they’d feel about that as they abide eternally in that hereafter called the jaws of hell. More importantly, I'm wondering how tomorrow's potential mass murderer might feel about that."

Every Monday The mass shooting at an Oregon school again raises frustrations about the level of gun violence. Perhaps the focus should be on peace as something other than the absence of violence. Loading... October 2, 2015 In a tone of exasperation, Barack Obama expressed his frustration Thursday after the latest mass shooting in the United States, this time at an Oregon community college. As president, he has issued statements of both anger and consolation following at least nine mass killings. “Somehow this has become routine,” Mr. Obama said. “We’ve become numb to this.” Like many people who seek an end to gun violence, Obama again called for tougher gun laws, which would certainly help to curb opportunities for would-be mass shooters. The president has long sought disarmament in many areas, such as for nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, even cyber-weapons. In the history of peacemaking, de-weaponization is a favored tactic. One reason such an approach has been inadequate over the past century is that it is based on a concept of peace as merely the absence of conflict. The desire to eliminate the physical means of violence only begins to touch on the idea of peace in its affirmative meaning, such as harmony, empathy, unity. “At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love,” stated Martin Luther King Jr. A vivid example of this understanding of “positive peace” was the reaction of Virginia Tech University following the 2007 shooting on its campus. In the same classroom building in which a gunman killed 30 people, the school set up an interdisciplinary program called The Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention. One school dean calls it a “healing center.” Obama and others could also note the success of anti-bully campaigns in schools and elsewhere over the past two decades. These programs do not just teach against aggression but also promote social skills, such as a capacity for compassion, respect for alternative views, and an ability to form community. Another proof that peace can be an active reality is the history of nonviolent movements. Two scholars, Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, point out in a 2011 book that campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more effective than violent insurgencies from 1900 to 2006. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Dr. King defined nonviolent tactics as “a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of love.” Peace can be learned, by both individuals and nations, and not as the opposite of something else. It operates out of a conviction that violence is not inevitable because so many human societies have learned how to supplant it with high ideals. “War is not in our genes, and we need not accept human aggression as a fate,” declared a 1986 statement by UNESCO. Surely Americans are not yet “numb” to the best antidote to gun violence: peacemaking, in all its active forms. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/latest-updates-shooter-had-3-pistols-rifle-5-extra-magazines-b99589117z1-330418871.html,"ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) — The latest on a deadly shooting at a community college in Oregon (all times local): 9:20 a.m. A federal agency says the gunman who killed nine people at an Oregon community college had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives provided the information late Thursday in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton. The shooting Thursday at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College also wounded seven. Officials identified the killer as Chris Harper Mercer. He died after a shootout with police. He isn't believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student there because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting. ——— 7:03 a.m. Social media profiles linked to a 26-year-old shooter who killed at least 9 people at a southern Oregon college suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. There didn't seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Chris Harper Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. He appeared to have at least one online dating profile. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development. A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle. ——— 6:51 a.m. A doctor says one victim of the deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college will likely be released from a hospital Friday. Dr. Jason Gray of Mercy Medical Center says the hospital in Roseburg, which is 180 miles south of Portland, received 10 patients Thursday — one died, two were quickly treated and released and three were transferred to a hospital near Eugene for a higher level of care. Of the four remaining patients, one was discharged late Thursday, and one was expected to leave Friday. Gray says the other two are expected to survive, but one remains in critical condition. The three patients who needed additional care were transferred to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend. The Eugene-area hospital says in a news release that two of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. ——— 6:02 a.m. Authorities investigating a deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college say they have found a number of firearms at the gunman's apartment. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told television stations in Eugene, Oregon, early Friday that investigators were at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College and the shooter's nearby apartment throughout the night. He says investigators will release details on the number and types of weapons later Friday. Officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer and say he opened fire at the college Thursday, killing nine people and wounding seven others before dying during an exchange of gunfire with officers. Hanlin also says investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment to try to learn more details."

ROSEBURG, Ore. – Armed with multiple guns, a 26-year-old man walked into a morning writing class at a community college in this rural Oregon town and opened fire, hitting some students with multiple gunshots. One witness said the attacker demanded to know students’ religion before shooting them. Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave. “We began to run,” student Hannah Miles said. “A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building.” At least nine people were killed and seven others wounded Thursday, the fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with about 3,000 students. “I suspect this is going to start a discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare themselves for events like this,” former college president Joe Olson said. The killer was identified as Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Mercer died after a shootout with police, who were not saying whether they knew of any motive. He had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton. Mercer is not believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting. He lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would be released later, he said. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The Associated Press that Mercer “seemed really unfriendly” and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.” Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday. Social profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. There didn’t seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account and a blog. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development. A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle. Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as uncommunicative. His father, Ian Mercer, said late Thursday that it’s been a “devastating day” for him and his family, and he has been talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana, California. Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn’t make sense. “All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,” she told KCBS-TV. Hanlin, the sheriff, said Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter’s name because that’s what he would have wanted. “I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” said a visibly angry Hanlin. Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn “Amazing Grace” was played. Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities. “That’s all I could think about today. There’s 10, 9 kids who won’t get those doors opened,” he said. Roseburg is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it’s no stranger to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and wounded a fellow student in 2006. After Thursday’s shooting, anguished parents and other relatives rushed to surviving students. Jessica Chandler was desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes. “I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s wounded,” Chandler said. Carnes’ best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital. Students described utter fear and panic after hearing the shots. Sarah Cobb, 17, was in a next-door classroom. She heard a shot. A teacher said they needed to get out, and the class ran out the door as she heard two more shots. “I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to think, what to do,” she said. Before the Roseburg shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school Thursday in the Northwest. The messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It was unclear if the messages were tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site. Investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter’s apartment seeking clues, Hanlin said Friday. The sheriff has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation. In 2013, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, declaring that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions “offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.” Associated Press writers Steven Dubois and Jonathan J. Cooper in Portland; Tami Abdollah in Roseburg; Martha Mendoza in Santa Cruz, California; Michael R. Blood in Torrance, California; Gene Johnson and Donna Blankinship in Seattle; and Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. Get the latest news delivered daily!

The killer was identified as Chris Harper-Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Mercer died after a shootout with police, who were not saying whether they knew of any motive. Federal investigators recovered six weapons at the college and seven at Mercer's nearby apartment. All of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years, Celinez Nunez, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assistant special agent in charge, said at a news conference Friday. Investigators also found a flak jacket next to a rifle at the school, which contained steel plates, she said. Mercer is not believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting, the ATF said. The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008 in South Carolina. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said Harper-Mercer was in the Army for a little over a month at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, but was discharged for failing to meet the minimum standards. Garrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed to meet. Generally, the Army requires recruits to pass physical fitness tests and to be generally in good physical and mental health. Recruits must also pass a multiple-choice test covering science, math, reading comprehension and other topics. He lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114972905/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Obama-says-no-more-shortterm-spending-deals/,"WASHINGTON — Although Congress averted a budget shutdown this week, President Obama said Friday that he will ""not sign another short-sighted spending bill"" when the current deal expires in December. Congress needs to avoid ""manufactured crises"" that are threatening to slow the progress of the economy, Obama said during a White House news conference. Although Congress passed a temporary budget deal this week, it only sets up another crisis for December, Obama said. ""It's not how we're supposed to operate,"" Obama said of the constant uncertainty about budgets and other government actions. ""We can't cut our way to prosperity,"" Obama said. ""Other countries have tried it and it does not work."" ""The bottom line,"" Obama said, ""is that Congress has to do its job."" Congressional Republicans responded by saying Democrats have blocked the passage of key bills. ""The President just said he won't sign any more short-term funding bills,"" said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Maybe he can tell his party to stop their filibusters of the long-term bills we’ve been trying to pass."" Obama spoke with reporters after one of the busiest 10-day periods of his presidency. It included high-profile meetings with Pope Francis and China President Xi Jinping, as well as a visit to the United Nations that featured a tense talk with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Obama answered questions from reporters Friday after announcing the resignation of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, one of the last two remaining members of his original 2009 Cabinet. USA TODAY Education Secretary Arne Duncan to step down Obama's dispute with Putin over Syria became more complicated less than 48 hours after their meeting. Russia launched air strikes inside of Syria that it said targeted the insurgent Islamic State; U.S. officials said the strikes hit revel opponents of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, whom Putin supports and Obama wants removed from power. On Syria, Obama said Friday, the situation now is not so different as before, because Russia has supported Assad for years. The main difference, he said, is that the Russians are doing it more openly. Obama said Putin doesn't distinguish between Islamic State fighters and moderate opponents of Assad. To Putin, Obama said, they're all terrorists. ""That's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I reject."" The Russian policy is only strengthening the Islamic State, and ""that's no good for anyone."" USA TODAY Russian airstrikes in Syria are gambit to extend influence Obama responded to critics who said he had not done enough in Syria, such as sending more weapons to factions inside the country. ""This is a hugely difficult complex problem,"" Obama said. When he makes judgments about Syria, he said, he has to consider that if the United States starts something, it has to finish it. Obama's news conference followed his remarks Thursday about the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. A frustrated Obama, noting that he has spoken after more than a dozen deadly massacres, angrily called on voters to demand that Congress and local officials pass tougher gun laws. ""Each time this happens I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said. ""Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" USA TODAY 11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded When asked about former Florida governor Jeb Bush's comments that ""stuff happens"" in reference to the Roseburg shooting, Obama said, ""I don't even think I have to react to that one."" The American people, he said, know there are too many mass shootings. ""I will continue to talk about this"" in his 15 months in office, Obama said, ""and I will continue to politicize it."" Americans who don't like the influence of gun activists in Congress and politics need to do something, Obama said. Even if politicians are ""great on other stuff,"" voters who want action on guns need to vote against them so politicians will react. The problem goes beyond just mass shootings, Obama said. He mentioned his hometown, Chicago, which has had a surge in murders and shootings. ""This is happening every single day,"" he said. ""Kids are just running for their lives every single days trying to get to school."""
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/bwd-qQiMhKg/,"A gunman opened fire on a classroom full of students at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon early Thursday afternoon, killing 10 people and wounding seven more. Another tragedy took place just a few hours later some 2,500 miles away, when a baby girl was shot and killed while riding in a car on Cleveland’s East Side. In response to yet another mass shooting under his watch, President Barack Obama stressed our nation’s need for laws that prohibit the ease of procuring a gun. “We are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people,” he said from the White House press room on Thursday evening. “We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these mass shootings every few months.” LeBron James followed the President’s lead, taking personal outrage gleaned from more senseless gun violence in northeast Ohio to his millions of social media followers. Like seriously man!!!! A baby shot in the chest in Cleveland. It's been out of control but it's really OOC. Ya'll need to chill the F out. — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015  C'mon man let's do and be better!  Don't fall into the trap. This can't be only way. Accept more from yourselves. #TheLand #TheNation — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015  But the four-time MVP wasn’t quite done emphasizing the need for reform of America’s gun legislation. After the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice on Friday, James took his opportunity in the public spotlight to advocate for the change that would help prevent additional gun-related tragedies. LeBron James spoke out on gun control, one day after another infant killed in Cleveland and Oregon tragedy. ""There's no room for guns."" — Tom Withers (@twithersAP) October 2, 2015  The 30-year-old has been increasingly outspoken on off-court issues over the past several years. James and the Miami Heat donned hoodies in March 2012 following Trayvon Martin’s death, and was among a sizable contingent of players who wore “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts last season in support of Eric Garner and protests related to police killings of unarmed minorities. No matter what direction their NBA fandom or even political sentiments lean, all basketball followers should be appreciative of James continuing to use his fame for the greater good of society. Here’s hoping his words, let alone those of the President, inspire the public to take a stand for stricter gun laws before more innocent lives are lost. "
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114968947/0/news-opinion~Massacre-at-Anytown-USA-Column/,"(This is a slightly updated version of a column orginally published in October 2015.) ANYTOWN, USA – A heavily armed, mentally disturbed young man opened fire yesterday at a school/church/theater/shopping mall, killing ___ people and critically wounding ___. The gunman also died, although it was unclear whether he shot himself or was slain by police responding to the scene. The Anytown massacre, the latest in a string of mass shootings across the nation, stunned the normally bucolic community. “I can’t believe something like this could happen here,” said Anytown Mayor _____ ______. As the sun set over the town, residents gathered to sing Amazing Grace at a candlelight vigil. Witnesses said they heard pop-pop-pop sounds that they initially mistook for firecrackers/balloons/a backfiring vehicle. Then they heard screams from inside the building. “We were lucky to get out alive,” said ____ ____, 18. POLICING THE USA Policing the USA Acquaintances described the gunman as a loner who showed signs of depression/felt like a ""nobody""/had trouble relating to women/spent many hours playing violent video games. Although he was prone to vicious outbursts, the acquaintances said they didn’t think he’d really do anything, so they didn’t bother to alert authorities. Authorities said they were trying to verify the authenticity of threatening rants the gunman posted on social media sites against blacks/whites/Christians/Muslims/Jews/people. On Capitol Hill, Democrats again called on Congress to pass “commonsense” gun control measures, such as universal background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons. It was questionable, however, whether any of those measures would have prevented the Anytown shooter from obtaining the guns used in the massacre. A spokesman for the NRA said the focus belongs on mental health and, out of respect for the victims, it’s too soon to talk about gun control measures. The spokesman noted that the massacre occurred in a supposedly “gun-free” zone and said that if only more people in the school/church/theater/shopping mall had been armed, the gunman could have been stopped sooner. USA TODAY Dear Roseburg, Shooting doesn't define you. Love, Newtown: Column Although more than half of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 2007, and the United States leads the world in gun-related homicides, congressional leaders signaled they had no intention of bringing up gun legislation before next year’s election. “If we didn’t do it after Sandy Hook, why would we do it now?” one Republican insider said. Back in Anytown, plans were being made to bury the victims, who ranged in age from __ to __,  and hold memorial services. The rest of the nation turned its attention to a full slate of weekend football games. Bill Sternberg is editor of the editorial page."

He even had to suffer zingers in the press and on social media, with commentators poking fun at the idea of a disgraced newsman coming back to seek redemption by covering the pope himself. But on Thursday, as news broke of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, Williams appeared to find his voice as a broadcaster once again. “This is always a spooky business watching people walking through the parking lot and police with dogs, which means one of those cars belonged to the gunman,” Williams said deep into the coverage of the shooting, a sample of his running narration as the story unfolded. MSNBC's aerial cameras circled the UCC campus as experts and witnesses jumped on and off screen -- all while Williams remained the guiding voice for viewers at home. It was exactly the type of story he would have been all over back in his days as anchor of ""Nightly News,"" where he resided for almost 10 years before stepping down after embellishing tales from an assignment in Iraq. In the middle of the chaos on Thursday, he seemed to be at home. “This is what Brian excels at, and it’s tremendous to have someone of his stature and skill on our air,"" MSNBC President Phil Griffin told International Business Times on Friday. Despite the grim nature of the story, the moment was a prime opportunity for Williams, his crew, and the higher-ups at MSNBC to prove that the cable channel can pull off its new mission: more hard news in place of the usual left-leaning chatter. As IBT reported this month, Williams' new job is essentially to be on call: He has no particular show, no particular time slot and, aside from breaking news coordinator Mark Lukasiewicz, works with any MSNBC producer whose show has been interrupted by the breaking desk. So far, it's worked with few, if any, hiccups. Without appearing on air every single day since his return, Williams and the breaking news desk have merged with the landscape of MSNBC (even after causing a slight rupture upon arrival), solidifying the anchor as a fixture on the channel, and once again a familiar face for people watching at home. Williams appeared with little fanfare when he came back on air during the pope's visit: A brief promo preceding his re-entry to TV land was the only bit of hype for his first broadcast in over six months. Appearing at the desk, with his staff tittering in the background of MSNBC's new breaking news set, Williams jumped straight into the coverage with no long-winded acknowledgments or personal pleas to viewers at home. ""Good day. I'm Brian Williams at MSNBC headquarters here in New York,"" he said. If things keep going according to plan at MSNBC, that's a phrase viewers will hear more often in the months to come."
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114972905/0/phoenix/nation~Obama-says-no-more-shortterm-spending-deals/,"WASHINGTON — Although Congress averted a budget shutdown this week, President Obama said Friday that he will ""not sign another short-sighted spending bill"" when the current deal expires in December. Congress needs to avoid ""manufactured crises"" that are threatening to slow the progress of the economy, Obama said during a White House news conference. Although Congress passed a temporary budget deal this week, it only sets up another crisis for December, Obama said. ""It's not how we're supposed to operate,"" Obama said of the constant uncertainty about budgets and other government actions. ""We can't cut our way to prosperity,"" Obama said. ""Other countries have tried it and it does not work."" ""The bottom line,"" Obama said, ""is that Congress has to do its job."" Congressional Republicans responded by saying Democrats have blocked the passage of key bills. ""The President just said he won't sign any more short-term funding bills,"" said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Maybe he can tell his party to stop their filibusters of the long-term bills we’ve been trying to pass."" Obama spoke with reporters after one of the busiest 10-day periods of his presidency. It included high-profile meetings with Pope Francis and China President Xi Jinping, as well as a visit to the United Nations that featured a tense talk with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Obama answered questions from reporters Friday after announcing the resignation of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, one of the last two remaining members of his original 2009 Cabinet. USA TODAY Education Secretary Arne Duncan to step down Obama's dispute with Putin over Syria became more complicated less than 48 hours after their meeting. Russia launched air strikes inside of Syria that it said targeted the insurgent Islamic State; U.S. officials said the strikes hit revel opponents of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, whom Putin supports and Obama wants removed from power. On Syria, Obama said Friday, the situation now is not so different as before, because Russia has supported Assad for years. The main difference, he said, is that the Russians are doing it more openly. Obama said Putin doesn't distinguish between Islamic State fighters and moderate opponents of Assad. To Putin, Obama said, they're all terrorists. ""That's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I reject."" The Russian policy is only strengthening the Islamic State, and ""that's no good for anyone."" USA TODAY Russian airstrikes in Syria are gambit to extend influence Obama responded to critics who said he had not done enough in Syria, such as sending more weapons to factions inside the country. ""This is a hugely difficult complex problem,"" Obama said. When he makes judgments about Syria, he said, he has to consider that if the United States starts something, it has to finish it. Obama's news conference followed his remarks Thursday about the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. A frustrated Obama, noting that he has spoken after more than a dozen deadly massacres, angrily called on voters to demand that Congress and local officials pass tougher gun laws. ""Each time this happens I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said. ""Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" USA TODAY 11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded When asked about former Florida governor Jeb Bush's comments that ""stuff happens"" in reference to the Roseburg shooting, Obama said, ""I don't even think I have to react to that one."" The American people, he said, know there are too many mass shootings. ""I will continue to talk about this"" in his 15 months in office, Obama said, ""and I will continue to politicize it."" Americans who don't like the influence of gun activists in Congress and politics need to do something, Obama said. Even if politicians are ""great on other stuff,"" voters who want action on guns need to vote against them so politicians will react. The problem goes beyond just mass shootings, Obama said. He mentioned his hometown, Chicago, which has had a surge in murders and shootings. ""This is happening every single day,"" he said. ""Kids are just running for their lives every single days trying to get to school."""

https://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australias-1996-gun-confiscation-didnt-work-and-it-wouldnt-work-america,"Follow Us National Review Clarence Thomas, an American Justice Our Punchline-in-Chief The Wuhan Lab Cover-Up Teaching Thomas Is Trump’s Power over His Party Fading? Within hours of the gunfire falling silent on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon Thursday, President Obama stepped up to a podium and declared that America should follow the path of our Anglosphere cousins to reduce gun violence. “We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings,” the president said. “Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.” “Australia” is Obama’s preferred euphemism for that most cherished of gun-control ideals: mass confiscation of the citizenry’s weapons. You will notice that the president doesn’t exactly spell out what following Australia’s model would entail. He speaks instead of “commonsense gun-control legislation,” “closing the gun-show loophole,” and “universal background checks.”
In the last 24 hours, New York magazine, CNN, and NBC have also sung the virtues of the Australian model.
But the Australian 1996 National Agreement on Firearms was not a benign set of commonsense gun-control rules: It was a gun-confiscation program rushed through the Australian parliament just twelve days after a 28-year-old man killed 35 people with a semi-automatic rifle in the Tasmanian city of Port Arthur. The Council of Foreign relations summarizes the Aussie measure nicely:

The National Agreement on Firearms all but prohibited automatic and semiautomatic assault rifles, stiffened licensing and ownership rules, and instituted a temporary gun buyback program that took some 650,000 assault weapons (about one-sixth of the national stock) out of public circulation. Among other things, the law also required licensees to demonstrate a “genuine need” for a particular type of gun and take a firearm safety course.

The council’s laudatory section on Australian gun-control policy concludes that “many [read: gun-control activists] suggest the policy response in the wake of Port Arthur could serve as a model for the United States.”
Two questions should be asked and answered: (1) Did the post–Port Arthur laws lead to a clear reduction of gun violence, and (2) What would an American version of the “Australian model” look like?

Gun-control activists claim that the Australian model directly resulted in a pronounced fall in the gun-suicide rate and the gun-homicide rate. But these claims are disputable. In August, Vox’s German Lopez wrote a piece that included a chart attempting to show a causal relationship between the Australian gun-confiscation regime and a reduction in the Australian suicide rate. “When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides,” Lopez wrote. I noted at the time that: While the chart does show a steady decline in gun-related suicides, the reduction occurred at the same time as an overall reduction in the Australian suicide rate. What’s more, firearm-related suicides had been declining in Australia for nearly ten years before the 1996 restrictions on gun ownership. Vox’s own chart does not appear to show a causal link between gun control and a reduction in suicide rates in Australia. Moreover, a look at other developed countries with very strict gun-control laws (such as Japan and South Korea) shows that the lack of guns does not lead to a reduced suicide rate. Unfortunately, people who want to kill themselves often find a way to do so — guns or no guns. Did the Australian model at least reduce gun-related homicides? That is hotly disputed. University of Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi concluded their 2008 report on the matter with the statement, “There is little evidence to suggest that [the Australian mandatory gun-buyback program] had any significant effects on firearm homicides.” “Although gun buybacks appear to be a logical and sensible policy that helps to placate the public’s fears,” the reported continued, “the evidence so far suggests that in the Australian context, the high expenditure incurred to fund the 1996 gun buyback has not translated into any tangible reductions in terms of firearm deaths.” A 2007 report, “Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?” by Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran similarly concluded that the buyback program did not have a significant long-term effect on the Australian homicide rate. The Australian gun-homicide rate had already been quite low and had been steadily falling in the 15 years prior to the Port Arthur massacre. And while the mandatory buyback program did appear to reduce the rate of accidental firearm deaths, Baker and McPhedran found that “the gun buy-back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia.” Would an American version of the “Australian model” perform any better? #related#In all likelihood it would fare worse. The Federalist’s Varad Mehta set down the facts in June: Gun confiscation is not happening in the United States any time soon. But let’s suppose it did. How would it work? Australia’s program netted, at the low end, 650,000 guns, and at the high end, a million. That was approximately a fifth to a third of Australian firearms. There are about as many guns in America as there are people: 310 million of both in 2009. A fifth to a third would be between 60 and 105 million guns. To achieve in America what was done in Australia, in other words, the government would have to confiscate as many as 105 million firearms.  And an American mandatory gun-confiscation program — in addition to being unconstitutional — would be extraordinarily coercive, and perhaps even violent. There is no other way around it: The mandatory confiscation of the American citizenry’s guns would involve tens of thousands of heavily armed federal agents going door-to-door to demand of millions of Americans that they surrender their guns. That. Is. Not. Going. To. Happen. If the president and gun-control activists want to keep saying “Australia” in response to every shooting in America, they should at least be honest about what exactly they are proposing. —Mark Antonio Wright is an assistant editor at National Review.

The gunman, identified as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, was the 10th casualty of the mass shooting and died after an exchange of gunfire with police. Included in the death toll was the professor of the class where the shooting reportedly started, Lawrence Levine, a 67-year-old English assisant professor. He graduated from the University of Oregon, according to what is believed to be his LinkedIn profile. Other victims ranged in age from 18 to 59: Lucas Eibel, 18; Quinn Glen Cooper, 18; Lucero Alcaraz, 19; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59, all of Roseburg; Jason Dale Johnson, 33, of Winston; Sarena Dawn Moore, 44, of Myrtle Creek; Treven Taylor Anspach, 20, of Sutherlin; and Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18, of Myrtle Creek.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/uqJYQSZXi5U/,"Hillary Clinton delivered harsh criticism of the National Rifle Association and Republicans in Congress on Friday in the wake of the deadly Oregon mass shooting, calling for a “national movement” to fight the gun lobby in the United States. In fiery remarks delivered at Broward College in Davie, Florida, Clinton lambasted the NRA and vowed to take on the gun lobby as president. “What is wrong with us, that we cannot stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby, and the gun manufacturers they represent?” a visibly angry Clinton said. “This is not just tragic. We don’t just need to pray for people. We need to act and we need to build a movement. It’s infuriating.” Clinton refrained just a day earlier on the eve of the Oregon shooting from harshly critiquing the NRA, and called on Thursday for stricter gun control measures. But she used her remarks on Friday to go on the attack, calling out Republicans for blocking background checks and other measures in Congress. “Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families,” Clinton said. A mass shooting at a community college in Oregon on Thursday left 10 people dead and seven wounded. The 26-year-old gunman had 6 weapons during the attack and wore body armor. The shooting has reignited a debate over gun laws in the United States, with most Republicans arguing that guns help keep Americans safe, calling instead for better mental health programs. John Kasich said he considers the death penalty an important check on mass shootings and Donald Trump saying the shooting was “horrible.” Democrats largely argue for stricter checks on the proliferation of weapons. The NRA has not yet commented on the shooting, but the conservative gun rights group Gun Owners of America accused some of politicizing the shooting, and said on its Facebook page that the Oregon shooter “chose a #GunFreeZone because it was ‘an easy target.'” There are about 310 million civilian guns in the United States, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, and somewhere between one-third and one-half of households have guns. The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world and the highest homicide by firearm rate among developed countries. It ranks around 100th worldwide in overall homicides. Clinton has called for universal background checks and closing loopholes that make it possible for gun buyers to purchase weapons without a background check online and at gun shows. She supported the Brady Bill, which established background checks for handguns and was passed by her husband Bill Clinton. Her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady Bill, but does support some gun control measures. “I will as your president never relent on trying to work on this, but we need a national movement,” Clinton said. She also conceded that gun lobbies had won important battles even while arguing that most Americans want stricter gun control measures. A 2013 Gallup poll showed that 65% of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases, though polls show a majority of Americans are opposed to “gun control.” “I don’t think they represent a majority of Americans or a majority of gun owners. They count on having a really intense dedicated group saying to politicians, ‘we will vote against you,'” Clinton said. “We’re not single-minded voters but each us of has to care about this issue. We’re going to take them on. We took them on in the 1990s and we’re going to take them on again.” In his comments last night, President Obama obliquely mentioned the NRA by calling on American gun owners to reconsider “the organization that suggests it is speaking for you,” but refrained from naming the gun lobby directly. Clinton’s decision to attack the NRA directly will likely be popular among the Democratic base, particularly those who are reticent of Sanders’ more moderate views. (He has been given an “F” rating by the NRA.) Florida, where Clinton delivered her speech, lands squarely in the middle of the Democratic nominating primary, two weeks after Super Tuesday, when Clinton allies hope the Democratic frontrunner will sweep up enough delegates to make the nomination a sure shot. But it’s also a key general election swing state, home to two of the more formidable contenders for the Republican nomination both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. Clinton has been to the state several times. During her last campaign trip to Florida in late July, Clinton laid out a plan to strengthen relations with Cuba and build of President Obama’s move earlier this year opening up discussions with with the isolated island nation. Florida is a bellwether of her appeal among Hispanic voters, a key voting bloc in the Democratic primary she will likely need to win the the nomination. Clinton’s event in Florida comes the same day that Sanders announced the hire of a director of Hispanic outreach. Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.startribune.com/opinion/letters/330475901.html,"As a child growing up in the 21st century, I can honestly say that I’ve grown up in an era of chaos and false security. I’ve grown up with terrorists attacking the twin towers; with active shooters firing on kindergartners, college students and moviegoers, and now with an active shooter firing on community-college students in Oregon, apparently for being Christian. When I go into a restaurant, I like to sit by the exit, just in case of an active shooter. I’m growing up in a time when my father asks me if I want a gun when I go to college because he fears for my safety. In 2012, when Malala Yousafzai, a young girl in Pakistan, was shot for wanting an education, she was celebrated for her courage. In America, today we could all be considered Malalas for our risk of getting shot spontaneously, yet we would not be celebrated for our convictions if victims were shot; we will just be victims, part of a national tragedy. Will those at Umpqua Community College in Oregon be celebrated for being courageous Christians? We are quick to fight the battle on terror, yet when it comes to the battle on gun control, we are reluctant because of our Second Amendment right, and are so scared that the government will infringe on it that it’s causing us to be blind to the risks we face. I would argue that some of the people in our own country pose a bigger threat than do terrorists. Stephanie Haima, Eden Prairie • • • I was making dinner, listening to talk on the TV about yet another mass shooting, when unexpectedly my friend’s face came into my mind and how I would feel when I learned she was killed by gun violence. If you’ve ever lost someone you love deeply in a sudden, unexpected and unnecessary way — an accident, suicide, illness — then you know: Your heart launches into your stomach, the floor drops out from under your feet, you’re overcome with nausea, and all you can say is “no, no, no, please, no.” In one moment, you cycle through disbelief, heartbreak, fear, panic and agony. In that same moment, you know that your life is now divided into the before and after. You will be able to identify this exact moment in time as the moment everything changed. Now imagine that person you love and adore — your child, partner, parent, lover, friend — is taken in that tragic, sudden, unnecessary, senseless way by a gun at the hands of another person who felt they had the power and authority to end the life of another human. That person you love so deeply got up that morning out of bed like she or he always does, went to school, to work, to have fun, expecting to have another day, deserving to have another day — and was tragically murdered by someone they may have known or who was a stranger to them. Tragically, every year, more innocent people die from bullets in accidents, domestic violence, suicide and from individuals who are being socialized by our society to believe that a gun is the solution to some perceived inadequacy, offense, or a difference in religion or skin color. Imagine the people you love deeply being cut off from the days they deserved to live, and the fear they must have felt in those final moments. We have the ability to change this senseless trajectory through smart, common-sense policies — the evidence is on the side of stronger, sensible laws that will make us safer. Imagine that this horrifying ending is the fate of a person you love, but you just don’t know when, and you have the ability to change it if you choose to do something about it. The future is not written; this cause is not lost, and prayers without action in response to preventable, unnecessary, senseless tragedy and agony are woefully inadequate and sadly misplaced. Susie Schatz, St. Paul • • • Though I voted twice for President Obama, he’s disappointed me many times, not willing to go far enough to tackle the nation’s worst problems. But he was spot-on perfect in his candid, angry remarks in the aftermath of yet another mass murder, the one Thursday in Oregon. It’s certain, he said, that some will say that the remedy for gun violence is more guns so we can “protect” ourselves. And then, in a voice so honest and exasperated as to be both shocking and refreshing, he asked: “Does anybody really believe that?” That’s the question the nation must answer if we hope to have any chance to cut down the carnage caused by gun violence. Steven Schild, Winona, Minn. • • • Mr. President, I just listened to your speech on the shooting in Oregon. My prayers and thoughts to those involved, and kudos to the law-enforcement response. I’ve been through active shooter training as a law enforcement officer, but I really can’t imagine the stress of having to respond to such a horrible event. Question: How’s the body politic and gun control working out in Chicago? It’s not — and, thus, I will continue to vote for those who support the Second Amendment, which you as a lawyer, Mr. President, should know wasn’t passed to support my hunting rights or to provide me the ability to protect my family from the common thug. Might I suggest that you promote amending the Constitution if you really want true gun control, but even if that is successful, the cat is out of the bag. Greg Hedtke, Rosemount • • • I am so sick of the argument that we can do nothing about gun violence because it will infringe on our “freedom.” When we realized having lead in the air was bad, I lost my “freedom” to use gas with lead in it. After one person tried to bring a shoe bomb on a plane, I lost the “freedom” of keeping my shoes on when I board a plane. I even lost the “freedom” of having my electrical outlets exposed when I became a parent, in order to keep my kids away from them. You know, when I think about it, I did not really lose my “freedom.” I became an adult and did what had to be done to make my family and the people around me a little bit safer. I really wish the people of this country could act like adults when it comes to gun violence and do what we need to do to stop mass gun violence. My kids and everyone else’s kids deserve nothing less. Thomas Lucy, St. Paul • • • CNN analyst and moderator Chris Cuomo referred to the “culture of violence” that is never addressed after mass shootings. Gun laws, the NRA, gun sellers and the Constitution are not the only entities that should be confronted with the need for radical change. To address the “culture of violence,” Americans need to recognize and aggressively lobby against the makers of violent games, the makers of violent movies, against insufficient mental health practices and against citizenry that tolerates openly aggressive behavior. The seeds of disintegration, nurtured by our complacency for viewing and accepting day-to-day violence as normal, is cultivated by many sources. We cannot continue to discount the origins of violent thought that ultimately culminate in chaos and the death of the innocent. Sara Meyer, St. Marys Point © 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

Read more and post comments at www.ibabuzz.com/politics. Oct. 1 The flames of an arson attack at a Planned Parenthood health center in Thousand Oaks were fanned by recent rhetorical attacks on the women’s health organization by anti-abortion-rights politicians and activists, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday. “The toxic rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood has dangerous consequences. It sends a signal that using violence to close clinics and intimidate health care professionals and women is ‘OK’. It is not,” Feinstein, D-Calif., said in an emailed statement. “I’m grateful that no one in Thousand Oaks was hurt. My thoughts today are with the clinic’s staff, who provide compassionate care in spite of challenges no health care provider should have to face.” Unfortunately, there’s a long history of violence against women’s health care clinics that provide legal abortions, Feinstein noted. “There have been more than 200 arsons and bombings over the past 40 years. These acts are serious crimes at the state and federal level, and the criminals who perpetrate them must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” she said. “Going forward, I hope that my colleagues think about the ramifications of their words. Doctors, nurses, clinic staff and patients should not be terrorized, threatened and put in harm’s way.” Oct. 2 For the “Fat Chance” file: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi asked outgoing Speaker John Boehner on Friday to create a select committee to address gun violence, one day after a man armed with five handguns and a rifle killed nine and wounded nine more at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College. House Republicans have steadfastly resisted all calls for more stringent gun controls in the wake of other mass shootings in recent years. And with Boehner on his way out this month and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, trying to shore up his conservative bona fides as a successor, it’s hard to see Pelosi’s plan as anything other than a total nonstarter. Besides the six firearms recovered at the massacre’s scene, investigators found seven more firearms — two handguns, four rifles and a shotgun — at the slain gunman’s home, said a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman. All the guns were legally obtained, obtained by the shooter or family members over the last three years through a federal firearms dealer, she said. “Prayers for the victims, families, students, & faculty at Umpqua Community College, & the community of Roseburg, Oregon,” Boehner tweeted Thursday. In her letter to Boehner, Pelosi, D-San Francisco, also said the select committee she proposes should have to report its recommendations to the House within 60 days, “in time for a vote before the third anniversary of the Newtown shooting this year.” She also urged Boehner to see that the House hears and passes a bipartisan bill — heretofore ignored by most Republicans — to require background checks for all firearm sales. “The epidemic of gun violence in our country challenges the conscience of our nation. Mass shootings and gun violence are inflicting daily tragedy on communities across America,” Pelosi wrote. “As of today, nearly 10,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 2015 — more than 30 gun violence deaths a day. Yesterday’s terrible attack at Umpqua Community College in Oregon marked the 45th school shooting this year alone.” Rep. Mike Thompson, House Democrats’ point man on gun violence issues and co-author of the languishing background-check bill, wrote to Boehner on Friday, too. “Every single time a mass shooting happens we go through the same routine. Thoughts and prayers are sent. Statements are made. Stories are written. And nothing changes,” Thompson, D-St. Helena, said in a news release. “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Congressional Republicans have done nothing over and over again and, predictably, the results have been the same: more innocent lives lost, more families forever changed and more mass gun violence,” he added.

Just straight up. ... Me and the head coach (Jim Tomsula) talked and he basically told me I’d be in a certain situation (backing up Carlos Hyde). But I wanted to hear it from the GM (Trent Baalke). I mean, you could let us compete. You didn’t have to say I was automatically going to take the backseat. Put it on me. I mean, bro, I finished last season with 1,100 yards. Every time I got opportunities, I did something with it. So, I felt like, ‘Fine, if you want to go with the young guy, (make him) beat me out.’ It wasn’t like I can’t play anymore. If he beats me out, I can handle that. ... I knew I couldn’t be there forever. But I was there 10 years and I played every down the same whether we were winning or not.” LeBron James The Cleveland Cavaliers’ star stated his support for stricter gun laws after three children were gunned down in Cleveland in a month and after Thursday’s mass shooting in at an Oregon community college. “There’s no room for guns, first of all, but then for violence toward kids or anybody. I see the news go across my phone and I’m sitting there in front of my three kids, so it automatically just hit me.” Chronicle news services"

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/3pZlIGMx5Ts/," After former Florida governor and current presidential hopeful Jeb Bush responded to gun control talk in the wake of the Oregon shooting with “stuff happens,” current President Barack Obama had a quick response, while others took to Twitter and created the sardonic #StuffHappens hashtag. According to Mediaite, during a White House press conference on Friday, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl read Bush’s quote back to Obama (which you can watch in the above video). The president quickly responded, “I don’t even think I have to react to that.” He then continued: “I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.'” President Obama then said that his team was investigating what they could do to “prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place,” but that American politics as a whole had to change before these mass shootings ended for good. He pledged to keep talking about the issue, like he did yesterday. In the meantime, Twitter users have tweeted critical messages about Bush and his comments under the hashtag #StuffHappens. #StuffHappens You know, like when you stub your toe on the coffee table. Or when an armed shooter kills 9 innocent people. You know, Stuff. — MATTY ICE (@MattyIceAZ) October 2, 2015  The tweets ranged from tongue-in-cheek ribbing of Bush and his presidential prospects.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114991965/0/phoenix/nation~Groups-ask-Congress-to-reform-mental-health/,"A day after a mass shooting in Oregon, 23 mental health groups are calling on Congress to pass legislation aimed at repairing the USA's broken mental health system. The groups delivered a letter to congressional leaders Thursday, just hours before the attack at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. left 10 people dead. The shooting was the latest in a series of mass killings perpetrated by unstable young men, many of whom were mentally ill. While people with mental illness are generally no more violent than anyone else, the attacks have cast a spotlight on mental illness and the serious gaps in mental health care. ""How many more reminders do we need that mental health has to be a high priority?"" asked psychiatrist Renee Binder, president of the American Psychiatric Association, which coauthored a letter to leaders of the House of Representatives, where several mental health bills have been introduced. ""This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an American issue."" Although more than 13 million Americans have a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression, most fail to receive the psychiatric care and services that could help them lead productive lives, according to the letter. USA TODAY Mental Illness: The Cost of Not Caring In the House, Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif., has sponsored a bill that aims to make it easier for families to be involved in the care of loved ones with mental illness. Today, doctors and nurses often cite federal privacy laws when shutting families out of their loved one's mental health care, even though, in many cases, they're legally permitted to share the information. Reps. Tim Murphy, R-Pa. and Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas  also have introduced a bill to clarify healthy privacy rules. Their bill also would create an Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders, who would coordinate mental health care across federal agencies and ensure that private insurers comply with federal laws on mental health coverage. In addition, their bill would increase the number of hospitals beds for people in acute psychiatric crisis; support early intervention; and support ""telepsychiatry"" to increase mental health care for people in rural areas. ""Basic services are not available for many patients who have severe mental illness,"" Johnson said. ""Many of these people end up homeless or incarcerated because there is a scarcity of treatment options."" Murphy said he's frustrated that his bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, has not moved forward. ""A person is dying from suicide, homicide or drug overdose every few minutes,"" said Murphy, a child psychologist. The cost of delaying action ""can be measured in lives lost. . . . Every time I hear about another tragedy, I think about how bill could have helped them, so that people have a place to go in a crisis."" The Murphy-Johnson bill ""really is landmark mental health reform,"" said John Snook, executive director of the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, which also cosigned the letter. ""It talks about every aspect of this issue in a really smart way."" Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., have introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Also in the Senate, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has introduced a bill that would allow communities to use federal funds to expand crisis intervention teams. These teams -- already in place in many police departments around the country -- are trained to respond to deescalate psychiatric crises, helping people with mental illness avoid arrest. Cornyn's bill also promotes mental health courts, which allow inmates with mental illness to receive treatment, rather than remain in prison. Ron Honberg, national director of policy and legal affairs at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said it would be ""heartbreaking"" if Congress fails to improve mental health coverage. ""We need to get something meaningful passed this year,"" said Honberg, whose group also cosigned the letter. ""We'll never have a better chance at reform because both the Republicans and Democrats agree that significant improvements to mental health care are needed."" Honberg said he hopes lawmakers will find a way to work together. ""To get legislation passed in Congress these days is a challenge,"" Honberg said. ""But the fact that we have agreement on the need to fix the broken mental health system is huge."""

X OUR PICKS:  Students begin to gather at the Douglass County Fairgrounds Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, where they can retrieve personal belongings and board busses for a trip to Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., to retrieve their cars. (Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian via AP)  People embrace while preparing to get driven to Umpqua Community College to collect belongings Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in Roseburg, Ore. Armed with multiple guns, Chris Harper Mercer walked in a classroom at the community college, Thursday, and opened fire, killing several and wounding several others and forcing the evacuation of students and faculty from the school. (AP Photo/John Locher)  Thursday was a very special day for Chris Mintz: Oct. 1 was his son’s sixth birthday. Though the child was too young to see it, the proud dad posted a happy birthday message on Facebook anyway on Wednesday night.
Hours later, as the former Army infantryman and Umpqua Community College student confronted a gunman on the rural Oregon campus, Mintz’s son was at the forefront of his mind, according to accounts provided by Mintz’s family.
Mintz, 30, encountered the gunman as he attempted to block the door of the classroom, his aunt Wanda Mintz told the Washington Post. Her nephew was shot three times, then fell to the ground. In that moment, she said, he tried to reason with the gunman.
“He hit the ground and looked up at him and said, ‘It’s my son’s birthday, don’t do this,’ ” Wanda Mintz recounted, after speaking to the mother of Mintz’s son. “And the guy shot him at least two more times.” 


When Wanda Mintz spoke to her nephew Friday morning he was weak but awake after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.
“He just tried to do the right thing,” Wanda Mintz said. “That’s just how he is. If he sees someone who needs help, he just helps. He just tried to intervene.”
Roseburg, Ore., has now been added to the grim list of American communities devastated by a mass shooting; the incident left 10 dead, including the shooter, and others injured.
And Chris Mintz is now counted among a group of heroes caught in the crossfire while trying to intervene.
Mintz sustained gunshot wounds to his upper back, abdomen, left hand and upper and lower leg, according to a Facebook post by Jayme Skinner, the mother of Mintz’s son. 


Both of Mintz’s legs were broken during the shooting, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his family to cover medical and child care costs. Photos on the page show Mintz smiling from a hospital bed. His aunt said Skinner has been by his side.
After spending 6 1/2 hours in surgery, “he is conscious and he understands what is going on,” Skinner wrote on Facebook.
“He will have a long road ahead of him of recovery. However, he is one tough dude and he will do just fine,” she continued, adding, “Today he became a hero.”
Relatives have spoken to Mintz often since the shooting. His uncle Jerry Brown — who along with most of Mintz’s family lives in Randleman, N.C. — also confirmed that Mintz had been shot multiple times while rushing the shooter, and said he was doing well in the hospital.
“We’re just so glad that he’s OK,” Brown said from North Carolina. “He always had determination. In a situation like that, you knew he would be the one to respond.”
Mintz was born and raised in Randleman, where he graduated from high school in 2003. He joined the Army and was stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, where he met Skinner, Wanda Mintz said.
He also has a wrestling and mixed martial arts background, having fought twice on the MMA amateur circuit in 2011 and 2012.
“He was on the wrestling team and he’s done cage-fighting, so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically,” aunt Sheila Brown told NBC News on Friday.
Mintz moved to Oregon six years ago when the North Carolina economy collapsed, Brown said. He had been working in the furniture business and living in a trailer with his young family but wanted something new.
“He’s gone out that way for a fresh start,” Brown said. “Things were going good out there for him. That’s what he was looking for — being with his family, raising his son, being in school.”
Mintz’s Facebook page is filled with motivational memes, reflections on the importance of faith and photos of him playing with his son.
Wanda Mintz said her nephew’s 6-year-old boy is autistic and is too young, anyway, to comprehend what happened to his father, who might need more surgeries and could be stuck in a wheelchair for some time after Thursday’s shooting.
As the story of Mintz’s courageous actions became national news, a new post popped up on his Facebook wall:
“This is Chris’s friend,” it reads. “Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts.”
Alek Skarlatos, one of three Americans hailed as heroes for stopping a terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train in August, would also have been at the college Thursday if Skarlatos hadn’t been in Los Angeles to rehearse for ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.”
Skarlatos, 22, told the network’s “Good Morning America” program that he attends a class at Umpqua, ABC News reported Friday.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EbQGCm88soY/,"On CNN’s “AC360” on Friday, without using his actual name, network justice correspondent Pamela Brown offered some insights into Chris Harper Mercer, the man responsible for the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, OR. According to the report, Mercer gave his writings to a survivor of the massacre, which revealed “hatred” toward black men and his struggles with the opposite sex. “In the middle of the shooting rampage, the gunman handed his writings to a survivor to give to police according to sources. In those pages, the shooter rambled about his hatred toward black men and how he was frustrated about being a virgin unable to find a girlfriend.” Brown went on to discussed the anti-Christianity aspect of his crime, but went back to his hatred of what was described to be “all different types of people,” including black men. “As a result, we’ve been asking people today, Anderson, if he left any trail behind indicating that he was anti-Christian or had a dislike for organized religion,” she said. “So far all we’ve been able to find is on a social media page that apparently belonged to him. He said he disliked organized religion but in the writings we talked about in the piece, apparently he gave no indication other than saying he associated with the dark side. Law enforcement officials I’ve been speaking with say this is someone that hated all different types of people. We talked about earlier – he hated black men. He described frustration with women.

http://www.chron.com/opinion/letters/article/Saturday-letters-Buffalo-Bayou-Oregon-shooting-6546598.php,"Buffalo Bayou reborn Regarding ""Buffalo Bayou"" (Page B8, Friday), the Buffalo Bayou renovation sounds marvelous. If only every Houston resident could stay there 24/7 and never leave in order to avoid the demolition derby occurring outside of its borders called Houston roads. In the recent past, I have had three tire replacements and one transaxle repair due to the negligence of our city government to provide safe and navigable roads. The city has set aside reportedly $220 million for hike and bike trails, while our roads literally crumble. Until the mayor and City Council live up to their primary obligation of providing basic infrastructure, there should be absolutely no funds applied to more frivolous projects. Carole Paul Vesely, Houston Americans have spoken Regarding ""Carnage at Oregon college"" (Page A1, Friday), once again President Obama's speech after a tragic mass shooting politicizes a terrible tragedy as he attempts to forward his agenda of stricter gun laws. The majority of the people of this country have made it clear that they do not want stricter gun laws. The 2013 successful recall elections of two Democratic members of the Colorado Senate who supported strict new gun control laws is one example. We grieve for the victims in the Oregon shootings and others, but not to the point where we wish to surrender our freedoms.For those who want to see how well severe gun ownership restrictions work, I would direct their attention to Mexico. Bob Fowler, Point Blank Boehner's surrender Regarding ""Boehner sets House leadership elections for next week"" (Page A4, Thursday), good riddance to House Speaker John Boehner. The left is trying to hype this as a mistake by the conservatives, but the reality is that John Boehner and other House Republicans did not use the power of the purse given to them by the Constitution to choke Obamacare. This disaster disguised as a good idea is an easy target built on lies like ""you can keep your doctor"" and ""premiums will go down."" Boehner was scared of forcing a shutdown, which is just more hype. Rodney Fenn, Houston"
http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Latest-Gun-Massacre-by-Christiane-Brown-Action_America_Crime-Murder_Enemy-151003-945.html,"Following the mind numbing Sandy Hook child massacre 2 years ago, like many Americans,  I wrote an OpEd calling for the passage of sane and sensible gun 
control legislation. 
At that time - in the midst of our 
collective pain and disbelief - there was a level of national outrage 
that caused many to hope that this was the tipping point - that the 
horrific deaths of 20 children and the 6 adults who tried to save them would finally be enough to shame our Congress and our nation into taking 
action. But nothing happened... From commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gun_violence.jpg: Gun control. Time to lay down the law.(Image by Christiane Brown, Author: St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office)   Details   Source   DMCA 



In the two years that have
 passed since the Sandy Hook tragedy there have been more than 986 mass shooting events in the United States resulting in the deaths of 1,234 people 
and the wounding 3,565 more. 
There is now one mass 
shooting every week in America - and yesterday the people of Roseburg 
Oregon became the ""latest"" victims of what has now become an almost commonplace occurrence   -  9 murdered, shot execution style in their college classrooms, the 
gunman (with reported mental health issues) armed with six guns - 
and a stash of seven more waiting at home.   
We can write again and 
again that the victims of these tragedies and their families deserve our
 call for sane and sensible gun laws in America. 


We can write 
again and again that the congressional stonewalling of any and all gun 
safety laws is an assault on our   freedom and our right to live safely in this country.  
We can write again and again that we have moved so far beyond the 2nd 
Amendment's Right to Keep and Bear Arms, that high grade assault weapons
 (their only purpose: rapid, mass killing), can now be found in almost 
any home and in any quiet neighborhood in America.
And we can 
write again and again about the thousands with serious mental health disorders who have no access to mental healthcare but have easy and rapid 
access to as many guns as they want, and can purchase these guns out of any 
car, any backpack or off of any internet site.
But when will our nation say enough? Guns have killed 428 times more Americans than terrorism over the past decade. So why is terrorism the enemy that we have spent trillions of dollars fighting?  In the past ten years
 there have been 55 terrorism related deaths in America and 225 
overseas. In that same time frame gun murders in America have claimed the 
lives 119,000 people.   That is the real terrorism in our lives, and unrestricted access to firearms is the enemy we need to be fighting.
But we already know this... It is all nearly routine now: the grieving, the outrage, the pain, the numbness and then, the moving on ... until the next one. So sadly predictable that   -- I have an idea... and I think it ought to be a real time saver - a fill in the blanks Gun Violence Op Ed form for Americans:

 The death of Aavielle Wakefield, plus a mass shooting at an Oregon community college in which nine people were killed, fueled the decision by the Cleveland Cavaliers star to take a public stand.

 ""Four kids under the age of 5 or 6 years old have been shot and killed or very badly injured,"" James told reporters in reference to recent shootings around Cleveland. ""There's no room for that. There's no room for guns, first of all, but then for violence toward kids or anybody. I see the news go across my phone and I'm sitting there in front of my three kids, so it automatically just hit me.
 ""It's not just in Cleveland, it's the whole nation that goes through this as well. We all hurt from it.""
 James didn't witness the speech of President Barack Obama following the massacre in Roseburg, Ore. -- an attack in which the shooter was killed by police. Part of Obama's comments included terming the United States as ""the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.""

 James agrees with Obama and wants to see change.
 ""I know what I see. I know how I feel,"" James said. ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out. I don't know how you can do that. There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big-time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.""
 James's stature as an NBA superstar gives him a voice and he's hoping speaking out will make an impact.
 ""Part of the education program we're doing is keeping those kids off the street and keeping their situations that's maybe bad and turning them into good,"" James said. ""I think what we're doing is controlling some of the violence. Some of these kids might be in violent situations, violent areas or violent homes and we're trying to keep them away from that.""

The Oregon shooting hero is getting pleny of ""McLovin"" from Americans who want to thank him for trying to take down the coldblooded killer who took the lives of nine community college students, but some supporters are sending their well wishes to the wrong guy, actor Christopher Mintz-Plasse. According to Us Weekly, the star who played McLovin in Superbad had to politely inform numerous Twitter users that he was not the hero who got shot seven times during the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. ""Get well soon,"" one Twitter user wrote in a message directed at Christopher Mintz-Plasse. ""The whole country is in your corner. Your son will never forget the unselfishness you displayed on his birthday."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse responded to the well-wisher's tweet by writing, ""So much love for the real Chris Mintz.""

However, he changed his mind when his ex-girlfriend, who is also the mother of his six-year-old son Tyrik, pointed out that he could use his appearances to talk about being the parent of an autistic child. In a strange coincidence, another American hero also attended Umpqua Community College, and he became a fixture on talk shows after his heroics made headlines around the globe. According to E! News, Alek Skarlatos was also a student at the Oregon school. Earlier this year, the Army National Guard Specialist helped take down a terrorist on a train in Paris, and his hero status him score a gig as one of the celebrity dancers competing on the current season of the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars. However, Alek Skarlatos decided to ditch his dance rehearsals to head back to Roseburg. ""I was enrolled as a student at Umpqua Community College prior to my 2014 deployment to Afghanistan,"" Skarlatos revealed in a statement obtained by E! News. ""While I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time in August aboard a train bound for Paris, I only wish that the same could be said for today.""

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123027/heres-why-no-one-can-agree-number-mass-shootings,"Depending on where you get your news, Thursday’s shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, was the 294th mass shooting, the 295th, or the 45th school shooting of the year. As Dave Cullen wrote in New Republic, news outlets will get the facts wrong in the immediate aftermath of an attack, but the conflicting news reports point to a more serious problem in America’s discussion of its gun problem. Gun control advocates rely heavily on the shocking numbers to make their case, but statistical discrepancies allow opponents to easily undermine the arguments. There’s no case to be made when everyone gets to view the evidence on their own terms. The confusion stems from varying governmental categorizations. There are mass murders and mass killings, active shooters and serial killers, mass shootings and mass public shootings. For instance, Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced website that many news outlets use, defines a mass shooting as one with “four or more people shot in one event.” In other words, they include incidents in which four people are wounded, but no one is killed. Accordingly, the database considers the Umpqua shooting the 295th mass shooting of the year. The FBI, by contrast, doesn’t have an official definition of “mass shooting” on the books, but in 2014 defined a “mass killing” as one with three or more fatalities in a report about active shooters—“an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area,” like at Columbine or Newtown. Using the three-fatality threshold, the Oregon shooting is the 54th mass killing of 2015. But in July, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) defined a mass shooting as a homicide in which four or more people are killed with firearms—a definition based on the FBI’s definition of a “mass murder” as opposed to a “mass shooting.” Under that definition, the Oregon shooting is the 32nd such incident in 2015. The conflation of “active shooter,” “mass murder,” and “mass shooting” has allowed the gun lobby to discredit statistics that point to the need for further control. The 2014 FBI report showed that active shooting incidents were increasing, but the NRA and other groups complained that this did not necessarily mean mass shootings were also increasing. Opponents of gun control can claim, like Jeb Bush did on Friday, that “stuff happens,” implying such incidents are just a fact of modern life. Similarly, Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox has said that the inclusion of statistics from the FBI’s “active shooter” report gives the false impression that incidents are rising when they are not. “A majority of active shooters are not mass shooters,” Fox told Time. “A majority kill fewer than three.” On Friday, Fox wrote in USA Today that “media folks reminded us of the unforgettable, high profile shootings that have taken place over the past few months, hinting of a problem that has grown out of control… as if there is a pattern emerging.” Fox is correct in pointing out that “active shooters” and “mass shootings” are not the same thing. But other statistics, including a Harvard analysis, show that mass shootings—in which four people were killed—have increased in frequency. The July CRS report also indicated that mass shooting incidents are also becoming deadlier. Of course, no matter which definition—and which statistics—you choose, America’s gun violence is appalling. The difference between three dead and four dead might be statistically significant, but is morally negligible. Just hours after the Oregon shooting, a man shot dead his wife and two others, and injured a fourth person, in North Florida. On Friday, five people were shot outside a Baltimore shopping center. The Mass Shooting Tracker total is now at 297. "
http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/2HAUpI5xYEs/,"Chris Harper Mercer may have been an ISIS supporter and may have been on a terrorism list ignored by the United States, a shadowy and thinly sourced report from the internet is claiming. In the wake of Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, many people have tried to dissect the motives of the now-deceased shooter. While online postings have painted a picture of a lonely and angry young man, others are suggesting that his motives were connected to the Islamic terrorist groups ISIS. A report from the European Union Times claims that Chris Harper Mercer ""had been included on a list of 87,000 'known/suspected' Islamic terrorists"" that was compiled by Russia, one that the United States reused to accept. The report claims the following.  ISIS terrorists may also be trying to claim Chris Harper Mercer as one of their own. A tweet from the account @K_H_O00 praised Mercer's shooting and appeared to take credit for the terrorist group, but it was later deleted by Twitter. This would not be the first time that ISIS sympathizers have tried to take credit for an American massacre. In the time shortly after this summer's mass shooting at a church in Charleston, a different ISIS sympathizer on Twitter claimed that the attacker was a terrorist. The the wake of Thursday's shooting, there were rampant and often disconnected rumors about the shooter's motives. After online profiles revealed that he was was mixed race, many jumped to the conclusion that the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism tied to the Black Lives Matter movement.  — Vanguard 14 (@keksec_org) October 2, 2015  — Vanguard 14 (@keksec_org) October 2, 2015  Addicting Info posted a screen capture of Mercer's thoughts on the shooting of Texas police officer Darren Goforth, which was connected to the Black Lives Matter movement.  Anastasia Boylan, who was shot multiple times, told her father that Mercer shot those who said they were Christian. ""And they would stand up and he said, 'Good, because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second,'"" Boylan's father told CNN. ""And then he shot and killed them.""  — Kyung Lah (@KyungLahCNN) October 2, 2015  — Kyung Lah (@KyungLahCNN) October 2, 2015  While police are still trying to determine the motives of Chris Harper Mercer, it appears that no evidence points to him being connected to ISIS.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/2KGXHHc6HKE/,"President Barack Obama recently spoke about the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, explaining that mass shootings were so frequent they were becoming routine - along with the response afterward. He called for expanded gun control measures, echoing the sentiments of the majority of Americans, but not some of the residents of Roseburg. On Thursday, Obama made his remarks on the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon that left nine people dead (not including the shooter) and several more injured. The Washington Post described the President as ""visibly frustrated"" in the press conference. He thanked the federal law enforcement officers in Oregon for saving lives, complimented the people of Roseburg, and tried to voice some of the grief that the locals were feelings. But Obama explained it wasn't enough.  Obama made a similar claim in June, after the Charleston shooting, saying ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" Politifact rated that line as ""mostly false,"" noting the 2011 bombing and shooting in Norway and the 2009 shooting incident in Winnenden, Germany, as just a few examples of recent mass killings in other advanced nations. Likewise, they found some developed nations had a higher mass-shooting fatalities per 100,000 people rate than the United States. Still, other countries similar to the U.S., such as Australia and the U.K., did have exceptionally low incident rates for mass shootings along with strict gun control laws - a fact mentioned in Obama's speech. He also said the frequency of tragic events like the Oregon incident has made all of this routine.  According to the Pew Research Center, Obama is correct. A poll conducted in July of this year found that 85 percent of Americans favor background checks on all private and gun show sales (including 79 percent of Republicans). Likewise, the pollsters found that 79 percent favored laws to prevent the mentally ill from purchasing firearms and 70 percent wanted a federal database to track gun sales. Still, the Guardian found the locals at Roseburg were wary of both President Obama and gun control measures despite the shooting. In the local gun store, there's a cardboard cutout of President Obama in an Arab keffiyeh scarf with a sign attached saying ""gun salesman of the year."" Obama's calls for gun controls often send people to the store to purchase firearms, in case future reforms make them unavailable. The Oregon store's owner Candi Kinney said that she had to order more assault rifles, explaining that there was always a surge in sales after a mass shooting. The Guardian's interviews with the Oregon locals resulted in a unanimous desire - that the shooting would result in more armed citizens, not the gun safety laws President Obama is promoting.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/03/oregon-attacker-armed-with-6-guns-extra-1/,"ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The man who opened fire on fellow students in his community college English class, killing nine people and severely wounding several others, was armed with six guns, multiple extra ammunition magazines and a flak jacket, law enforcement officials said Friday. Survivor: Oregon gunman spared student to take package to police Survivor: Oregon gunman spared student to take package to police In all, the gunman -- who died in a shootout with police -- had owned 14 firearms, said Celinez Nunez, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including one he had traded in. The Douglas County sheriff's office said the shooter took five handguns and a rifle to Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Thursday, and he had two pistols, four rifles and a shotgun in his apartment. ""All 14 have been traced to a federal firearms dealer,"" some bought by the gunman and others by members of his family, said Nunez, the assistant special agent in charge of the Seattle field office. ""They were all purchased legally. ""We also were able to recover a flak jacket lying next to the rifle at the school. The jacket had steel plates, along with five magazines. An additional amount of ammunition was also recovered at the apartment."" Oregon's top federal prosecutor said the shooter used one of the handguns when he opened fire on classmates. Interim U.S. Attorney Billy Williams said Friday that the gunman stashed a rifle in another room and did not fire it. He said it's impossible to know what the shooter had planned for the rifle. Officials Friday described the shooter, identified by Oregon State Police as Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, as an alienated man who appeared to have a particular animus against religion and was an Army boot camp dropout. They said investigators were studying writings he left behind in which he described himself as angry and depressed. ""He seems to be someone who was very anti-organized religion and was suffering from all sorts of self-worth issues,"" said a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""It does not appear like he was part of some larger group."" Also Friday, officials released the names of the dead, who ranged in age from 18 to 67 and included several freshmen and a teacher. One of the freshmen was active in the Future Farmers of America and loved to play soccer. For another, it was only his fourth day studying at college. One was a 59-year-old student whose daughter was enrolled in the same school but not injured in the shooting. Grieving families began sharing memories of their loved ones. ""We have been trying to figure out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that would take 18 years,"" the family of Lucas Eibel, 18, said in a statement released through the sheriff's office. Eibel, who was studying chemistry, volunteered at a wildlife center and animal shelter. Quinn Glen Cooper's family said he had just started college and loved dancing and voice acting. ""I don't know how we are going to move forward with our lives without Quinn,"" the Coopers said. ""Our lives are shattered beyond repair."" Authorities identified the other seven victims as Lucero Alcaraz, 19; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59; teacher Lawrence Levine, 67; Jason Dale Johnson; Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18; Sarena Dawn Moore, 44; and Treven Taylor Anspach, 20. Seven other people were wounded in the attack in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Family members of some survivors said their relatives told them that Harper-Mercer specifically targeted Christians. Law enforcement officials have not confirmed that. ""'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them,"" Stacy Boylan, father of Anastasia Boylan, 18, told CNN. ""'And if you're a Christian, stand up.' And they would stand up and he said, 'Good, because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second.' And then he shot and killed them, and then he kept going down the line doing this to people."" He said his daughter was shot in the spine but survived. Sheriff John Hanlin said Friday that it is too early to reach any conclusions. ""It is really too early to tell what the motive was,"" he said. ""We hope to get to the bottom of that in the next couple of days."" Accounts of what happened when the gunman stormed a classroom in Snyder Hall began to emerge, often from relatives who had spoken with survivors. One of the injured, Chris Mintz, 30, was shot five times and suffered two broken legs, but he is expected to live, according to family members interviewed by television station WGHP in North Carolina, where he grew up. Mintz ""tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming, gets shot three times, hits the floor, looks up at the gunman and says 'It's my son's birthday today,' gets shot two more times,"" said his aunt, Wanda Mintz, who was interviewed by the television station. Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the other, and their teacher told them to leave. ""We began to run,"" student Hannah Miles said. ""A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building."" Of those rushed to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, four underwent surgery for gunshot wounds, including one who died in the operating room, and two others were treated for less serious injuries and released, hospital officials said Friday. Three of the most seriously hurt were taken to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center in Eugene. Umpqua Community College remained closed Friday and classes were canceled for next week. ""Right now, it is a crime scene,"" Rita Cavin, the interim president of the college, said. 'Kind of out there' Those who knew the shooter described an awkward loner. Several years ago, Harper-Mercer moved to Winchester, Ore., from Torrance, Calif., with his mother, a nurse named Laurel Harper. His father, Ian Mercer, originally from the United Kingdom, told reporters outside his Tarzana, Calif., home, ""I'm just as shocked as anybody at what happened."" At school in Oregon, ""he was a typical Roseburg kid, kind of nerdy, kind of out there. Just himself,"" said Alex Frier, a stage manager at the college who said Harper-Mercer built sets for theater performances last semester. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, said Harper-Mercer ""seemed really unfriendly"" and would ""sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" At an apartment complex where Harper-Mercer and his mother once lived in Southern California, neighbors remembered a quiet and odd young man who rode a red bike everywhere. Reina Webb, 19, said the man's mother was friendly and often chatted with neighbors, but Harper-Mercer kept to himself. She said she occasionally heard him having temper tantrums in his apartment. ""He was kind of like a child, so that's why his tantrums would be like kind of weird. He's a grown man. He shouldn't be having a tantrum like a kid. That's why I thought there was something -- something was up,"" she said. The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said Harper-Mercer was in the military for a little over a month at Fort Jackson, S.C., but he was discharged for failing to meet the minimum standards. Garrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed. Generally, the Army requires recruits to pass physical-fitness tests and to be in generally good physical and mental health. Recruits also must pass a multiple-choice test covering science, math, reading comprehension and other topics. Harper-Mercer's social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army and frustrated by traditional organized religion. He also tracked other mass shootings. In one post, he appeared to urge readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues live on TV in August in Virginia, noting ""the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" He may have even posted a warning. A message on 4chan -- a forum where derogatory comments against minority groups and women are frequent -- warned of an impending attack, but it's unclear if it came from Harper-Mercer. ""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest,"" an anonymous poster wrote a day before the shootings. Also Friday, President Barack Obama said he would make a political issue of U.S. gun violence and pressure Congress to change firearms laws. ""This will not change until the politics changes and until the behavior of elected officials changes,"" Obama said at a White House news conference. ""The main thing I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about this on a regular basis. And I am going to politicize it. Because our inaction is a political decision that we are making."" The president, who more than a dozen times has addressed the nation in the aftermath of a mass shooting, said the response to such violence had become too routine. ""This is a political choice we make -- to allow this to happen every few months in America,"" Obama said Thursday after the Oregon shooting. GOP presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Thursday on Twitter that the president was ""quick to politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda."" Another Republican presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, questioned Friday whether the federal government should be the source of solutions to gun violence, including limiting firearms access for people with mental illness. He said that states should take the lead in such efforts. Information for this article was contributed by Claire Cain Miller, Richard Perez-Pena and Michael S.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/03/2-settlers-shot-dead-in-west-bank-20151/,"JERUSALEM -- Israel's military deployed hundreds of troops in the West Bank on Friday, a day after a drive-by shooting by suspected Palestinian gunmen killed a Jewish settler couple driving home with their children. The attack took place late Thursday when gunmen opened fire on a vehicle traveling near the Palestinian village of Beit Furik. The shots killed Eitam and Naama Henkin, residents of the Jewish West Bank settlement of Neria. Their four children, including a 4-month-old, were in the back seat of the car but were unharmed. On Friday, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon visited the site, pledging to catch the perpetrators and, like other Israeli politicians, blaming Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for inciting such violence. Thousands attended the parents' funeral Friday in Jerusalem, including Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. ""We cannot stand silently when the hands of murderers steal a loving mother and father away from their children,"" Rivlin said in a eulogy. ""We are facing a brutal terrorist onslaught."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that Abbas and his government explicitly condemn the slaying of the couple. Meeting Secretary of State John Kerry in New York on Friday, Netanyahu said he appreciated U.S. condemnation of Thursday's attack and noted that some Palestinians had praised the killings. He said the only way to deal with such events is to fight terrorism, and he called on the international community to press Abbas and the Palestinian Authority to act. ""I have to say I have yet to hear any condemnation from President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority,"" Netanyahu told Kerry. ""Worse, I heard senior officials from his Fatah movement say 'This is the way to go'. No, it's not the way to go. The way to go ... is to fight terrorism and to make sure that terrorism reaps no rewards."" Netanyahu and Kerry noted the mass shooting at a college in Oregon on Thursday that left nine people and the gunman dead. They said Israel and the U.S. were united in grief. ""We're sharing with you the grief that Israel feels today,"" Kerry said. ""I hope we can share also the efforts going forward to reduce and maybe ultimately one day eliminate"" these ""terrible losses"" for the families. The attack comes on the heels of a series of Palestinian rock and firebomb attacks that have prompted Israel to vow to quash such threats. It also followed a hard-line speech at the United Nations by Abbas, the last of several that Israeli leaders have condemned as incitement. Abbas has said that Israelis desecrate a Jerusalem holy site with their ""dirty feet"" and that Israel was committed to the ""ethnic cleansing"" of his people. Speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, Abbas said Israel had repeatedly violated its commitments, most notably by expanding settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, on lands the Palestinians seek for a future state, and accused Israel of waging ""a new war of genocide ... against the Palestinian people."" ""A people whose leader encourages murder will never have a state, and this must be stated clearly,"" said Cabinet minister Naftali Bennett, head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party. Settler leaders said they planned to stage a protest in front of Netanyahu's office to demand tougher action to defend the settlers from militants. Gaza's Islamic militant Hamas rulers welcomed Thursday's attack but stopped short of claiming responsibility for it. Abbas' Palestinian Authority did not comment on the attack. Tensions have flared between Israelis and Palestinians over the Jerusalem site known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to the biblical Temples, and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, site of the Al-Aqsa mosque and the spot from where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended to heaven.

Chris Mintz, an amateur MMA fighter with a record of 1-1, was shot seven times by a gunman Friday during a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Mintz survived, but took bullet wounds to the back, abdomen and hands, according to NBC News (h/t Washington Post). The 30-year-old became an instant hero in the hours after the incident, which saw 10 people dead, including the gunman, and seven more injured. The casualties may have been even worse, if not for Mintz blocking the shooter's way into a classroom full of fellow students, reportedly telling the gunman ""you're not getting by me,"" according to a report from KTLA 5. This is Chris's friend, Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts. The shooter, who was subsequently identified as Chris Harper Mercer, opened fire on Mintz, but apparently did not get into the classroom. Here's your hero! Chris Mintz, Army vet used to live in Tacoma. He rushed the gunman and survived being shot 7 times pic.twitter.com/0lj8JF67or Later, Mintz's aunt, Sheila Brown, told NBC News Mintz was ""on the wrestling team and and he's done cage-fighting so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically."" ""[Mintz] tried to protect some people,"" she added. ""We were told he did heroic things to protect some people."" Mintz is also a 10-year Army veteran. In a sport that often sees villainous figures like War Machine and the arrests of top fighters like Jon Jones grab headlines out of the cage, it is a major change from the norm to see someone like Mintz, whose background in MMA is not elite but exists nonetheless, earn notoriety for the right reasons. Simply put: Chris Mintz is someone the MMA community can and should be proud of. Enjoy our content? Join our newsletter to get the latest in sports news delivered straight to your inbox!

http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/watch-stephen-colberts-powerful-monologue-about-oregon-shooting-20151003,"Welcome, “These things happen over and over again and we’re naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them, but then we change nothing, and we pretend that it won’t happen again,” ‘Late Show’ host says Reporter Stephen Colbert ended his first month as The Late Show host by opting to tackle tragedy head on with a powerful monologue that examined yet another “senseless” mass shooting, this time at an Oregon college that left 10 people dead, and our own “insanity” for doing nothing to prevent the next one. Like his predecessor David Letterman, Colbert elected to confront a serious issue gripping our country, even as late-night television is generally regarded as a comedic haven from the harsh realities. “Whether or not we hit the right notes on any given night, I think that the least that we can do is not pretend to always know what to do or say, and in the face of the killings in Oregon yesterday I don’t know what to do or say, other than our hearts are broken for the people struck by this senseless tragedy,” Colbert said. “And I don’t know how to start a show like this, which is often about whatever happened in the last 24 hours. I can’t pretend that it didn’t happen; I also can’t pretend to know what to do to prevent what happened yesterday and all the times it has happened before. But I think pretending is part of the problem.” Related

						The Best Audiophile Turntables for Your Home Audio System Without taking sides or politicizing the incident, Colbert still criticized lawmakers for their overall inaction. “These things happen over and over again and we’re naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them, but then we change nothing, and we pretend that it won’t happen again. Some say the answer is stricter gun laws; others say the answer is mental health care, that we need better treatment or just keep the guns out of the hands of the insane. Maybe it’s both, I honestly don’t know,” Colbert said. “But I do know that one of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” After Colbert’s moving speech, the host brought some levity back to The Late Show by discussing “honest insanity” in the form of Donald Trump. “Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say: You’re not going to be president,” Colbert said. “There is zero chance we’ll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.” Colbert’s monologue was reminiscent of his former colleague Jon Stewart’s heartbreaking remarks on The Daily Show in the wake of the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting in June. “I honestly have nothing other than just sadness once again that we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal, yet we pretend it doesn’t exist,” Stewart said before admitting, “I’m confident, though, that by acknowledging it, by staring into that and seeing it for what it is, we still won’t do jack shit. Yeah. That’s us.” In This Article:

Here are the data, charts and maps seeking to put the issue in perspective. Following the shooting at an Oregon community college in early October that left 10 dead, including the shooter, President Obama delivered an emotional statement to the press lamenting that the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where mass shootings have become commonplace. He reiterated that sentiment on Wednesday following news of the San Bernardino shooting, telling CBS News, “We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world.” There’s data to show that he’s right. The San Bernardino shooting is the 355th mass shooting this year. That data comes from the Mass Shooting Tracker, maintained by the Guns Are Cool subreddit, which defines a mass shooting as one in which “four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling off period.” Earlier this year, the Washington Post charted firearm homicides per 100,000 people among wealthy nations, based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: “Somehow this has become routine,” Obama said after the Oregon shooting in October. “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it ... We have become numb to this,” he said. It’s no wonder that Obama feels his response to mass shootings is routine: The Washington Post’s Christopher Ingram writes there is a simple reason mass shootings have become routine: there are more guns than people in the U.S. This Vox graphic shows that the U.S. has 4.4% of the world’s population, but 42% of civilian-owned guns: Put another way: There is data showing a correlation between gun ownership and mass shootings internationally: Read: 10 things the gun industry won’t tell you Obama has said his primary strategy going forward on gun control legislation would be to mount a public campaign. He has called on Americans to change the politics and elect lawmakers who are willing to take steps to curb gun violence. Quorum has visualized the congressional response to major shootings over the past several years: That data show that congressional mentions of mass shootings in the context of gun control and mental health issues peaked after the late-2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn., when the White House unsuccessfully pushed for increased background checks for gun purchases. Republicans and Democrats do differ on the issue of guns, at least, in how they talk about it: Meanwhile, this National Journal article looks at the congressional response by tallying up the number of bills addressing gun usage and access passed in the wake of school shootings: Read related commentary: The NRA’s profit soars as deaths from gun massacres mount Read: 5 things harder to buy than guns Among the states with the lowest death rates from firearms are Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Hawaii. A graphic in the National Journal explains why that might be: those same states have the most gun laws. California strengthened its gun laws in 2014 and now has some of the strongest gun laws in the U.S. A Mashable analysis found that stricter gun control laws do correlate strongly with lower gun-related death rates: But the relationship becomes weaker once states meet a certain level in the strength of gun control legislation. California, for instance, has higher gun-related death rates despite its strong legislation. ARK’s daily email disclosure revealed the firm has bought 2.1 million shares in Skillz, worth an estimated $20.8 million.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/gun-control-oregon-shooting-congress-colorado-connecticut,"Gun lobbyists’ grip on Congress may block action on tightening gun laws, but reforms on the state level have proven not to be as politically toxic as advertised Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST As America grappled with another mass shooting – an epidemic Barack Obama referred to as “routine” – the president made a simple request: start politicizing gun violence.  Lawmakers have shied away from enacting stricter gun laws for precisely this reason: new restrictions would infringe on second amendment rights, they argue, and at best do little to prevent further shootings. But for proponents of gun control, those explanations are thinly veiled excuses amid intense pressure from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun rights advocates. A look at gun policy at the state level, however, provides evidence that new reforms are not as politically toxic as advertised. While the gun lobby has chalked up victories in terms of loosening firearm restrictions in conservative states, Americans have not in recent years kicked out of office those lawmakers who voted against them – or, in some cases, advanced comprehensive gun control packages. One such litmus test occurred last year in the 2014 midterm elections, when the odds were arguably stacked against gun control advocates. Democrats suffered heavy losses at the state and federal levels, losing control over the US Senate and suffering defeats in key gubernatorial races across the country. But two governors, Democrats who were deemed vulnerable, survived: Dan Malloy of Connecticut and John Hickenlooper of Colorado. Both signed into law sweeping gun reforms. One could argue their constituents were behind those efforts – for Malloy, the action followed the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown. For Hickenlooper the legislation was prompted by the Aurora movie theater shooting that same year. But Hickenlooper, especially, was a top target for the NRA. Gun rights advocates had recalled in 2013 two state Democrats in Colorado who voted for his gun package, which expanded background checks and placed a ban on high-capacity magazines. Not only did Hickenlooper hold on to to his seat, but the Republicans also lost the two seats they picked up in the recall the year before – undermining, in essence, the pro-gun narrative around its success. Malloy was similarly re-elected even though the Sandy Hook shooting led the governor to sign some of toughest gun laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban, prohibition on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks. Tom Foley, his Republican opponent in the 2014 race, refused throughout the election to articulate his position on gun laws. In perhaps the biggest win for the anti-gun violence coalition, voters in Washington State overwhelmingly supported a ballot initiative to expand background checks while rejecting a competing measure from the NRA designed to ease restrictions. Questions over the political consequences of supporting stricter gun laws extended to the federal level too. When the Senate failed to expand background checks after the tragedy in Newtown, two Democrats who sided with the NRA and opposed what was known as the Manchin-Toomey bill – Arkansas senator Mark Pryor and Alaska senator Mark Begich – lost their seats anyway. The outcome, at the very least, supported a poll conducted just prior to election day in which Americans said they did not rank gun control as a top issue. It is unknown whether that will change in 2016, a presidential election year that will draw far greater turnout. Democrats would certainly like attitudes to shift in their favor for what has emerged as yet another party line issue. Hillary Clinton has increasingly campaigned in favor of new gun laws amid a series of mass shootings over the summer and called for holding both the NRA and politicians accountable. It’s a risk that Obama himself did not take when facing re-election in 2012, memorably responding to a gun control question during a presidential debate with Mitt Romney not long after the Aurora movie theater shooting by focusing on the need to enforce current laws and keep guns away from the mentally ill. Obama, of course, has since been freed from the political ramifications of a hot-button issue and advocated for stricter gun laws with more passion than any modern president. He has pointed out that the rate of gun-related deaths and injuries in the US are unparalleled in the developed world. On Thursday he asked the media to publish comparisons of the number of Americans killed by terrorism as opposed to gun violence. As the president said while addressing the Oregon shooting with visible frustration bordering on helplessness, action “will require a change of politics on this issue”. “It will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision,” Obama said. “If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.” Recent years have shown that the American public is increasingly amenable to modest changes in access to firearms – their elected officials simply refuse to acknowledge it."

But then we change nothing. And we pretend that it won’t happen again.” Colbert admitted he didn’t know if better mental health treatment or stricter gun laws were necessary, but said he did know that pretending and insanity are usually connected. “One of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” Colbert then segued into the rest of the segment about Donald Trump, congress, and “honest insanity.” WANT MORE?

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/115158919/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Tennessee-Lt-Gov-Christians-should-consider-arming-themselves/,"NASHVILLE — Responding to a mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left 10 people dead, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey is encouraging fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to consider getting a gun. The Republican from Blountsville made those remarks in a Facebook post Friday, one day after a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. The suspected gunman, 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, reportedly asked victims to name their religious affiliation during the massacre. In his Facebook post, Ramsey links to a New York Post article with the headline ""Oregon gunman singled out Christians during rampage."" Ramsey groups the Oregon shooting with other recent mass shootings around the U.S. ""Whether the perpetrators are motivated by aggressive secularism, jihadist extremism or racial supremacy, their targets remain the same: Christians and defenders of the West,"" Ramsey said. ""While this is not the time for widespread panic, it is a time to prepare,"" he later adds. ""I would encourage my fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to think about getting a handgun carry permit. I have always believed that it is better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it. USA TODAY Grieving Oregon community struggles to understand shooting ""Our enemies are armed. We must do likewise."" His comments elicited a written statement from Democratic state Rep. John Ray Clemmons, who said Ramsey's comments ""reek of fear-mongering and religious crusading."" ""Rather than lead the General Assembly’s bipartisan efforts to improve public safety by removing guns from the hands of criminals and addressing the serious mental health issues confronting many in our state, Senator Ramsey unfortunately chose the road most traveled by the radical right,"" said Clemmons, who introduced a bill earlier this year that sought to amend the state's ""guns-in parks"" legislation. ""Senator Ramsey’s inciting statements in the face of a national tragedy are all the more alarming when you consider them in their historical context,"" he added. ""Things have never ended well when any leader has asked people to take up arms in the name of their religious faith. This type of rhetoric is counter-productive to our efforts on so many levels."""

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/oregon-community-college-gunman-killed-himself-sheriff,"First published on Sat 3 Oct 2015 21.05 BST The gunman responsible for Oregon’s worst mass shooting killed himself as police closed in, it has emerged.  Chris Harper-Mercer took his own life after being “neutralised” by officers who responded to the massacre scene in Roseburg on Thursday, Sheriff John Hanlin told a news conference on Saturday afternoon. The medical examiner had determined “suicide” as the cause of death, Hanlin said, without elaborating. It was initially thought the 26-year-old died from police bullets after murdering nine classmates and wounding nine others at Umpqua community college, where he was enrolled in a writing course. Hanlin said the deputies’ intervention saved dozens of lives by incapacitating the shooter, who wore body armour and carried enough firepower – three handguns and a rifle, plus lots of ammunition – for a potential siege. Police found another eight guns – it was initially reported to be seven – at the family home, bringing the total in the killer’s possession to 14, said the sheriff. The latest details came after Blackhawk helicopters ferried victims’ bodies back to Roseburg for burial, as the town prepared for funerals which it hopes will shift attention from the killer to his victims. The Oregon national guard airlifted the nine corpses from Portland, where autopsies were conducted, back to a hometown shrouded in mourning. The two helicopters broke a quiet, sunlit autumnal morning to land at the logging community’s small airport. The bodies were taken in a small fleet of vehicles to funeral homes to be prepared for burial. The victims were: Luero Alcaraz, 19; Treven Anspach, 20; Larry Levine, 67; Kim Dietz, 59; Quinn Glen Cooper, 18; Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18; Jason Johnson, 34; and Sarena Dawn Moore, 44. It was reported that Harper-Mercer passed a small box or envelope to a male student whom he spared, prompting speculation it held a note or a digital device containing a document detailing alienation and grievances, including the killer’s hostility to organised religion and his inability to find a girlfriend. Stacy Boylan, whose daughter Anastasia was injured in the shooting, said she told him the gunman “gave somebody a box, somebody who lived, and said, ‘You gotta deliver this.’” Another version of events said it was an envelope. The family of Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, a 16-year-old nursing student who was wounded and is believed to be the youngest casualty in the attack, told reporters at Mercy Medical Center that a bullet entered her back, clipped a lung and lodged in a kidney, which surgeons removed. “Her recovery will be long but she’ll get there,” said her mother, Bonnie. Bonnie Fitzgerald said her daughter saw the killer give an envelope to a student whom he ordered into a corner, “because obviously he was the one who was going to be telling the story”. The mother paraphrased a message Cheyeanne texted from the scene: “Fucker shot me in the back.” The family has set up a fundraising site to help pay medical bills. A failed soldier with apparent mental illness who lived with his mother, Harper-Mercer appeared to crave the infamy of other mass murderers. Roseburg, however, resolved to shift attention to his victims, a group ranging in age from 18 to 67, among them a basketball player, an outdoorsman, a student nurse and an animal lover, who had all signed up to a writing course at the campus where Harper-Mercer was also enrolled. “In remembrance”, said a banner headline of the local News-Review newspaper, accompanied by the names and images of the nine dead but no mention of their killer. People queuing to donate blood at a mobile clinic in the centre of town reflected the sentiment, saying the town, and the national blaze of publicity, should focus on victims. “This is hard. We’re very tight-knit here,” said Joleen Conner, 36, her arm patched after donating blood. She graduated from UCC three years ago and knew people caught up in the rampage. “I had pins and needles waiting to hear from everyone.” Flags flew at at half-staff and fast-food restaurants joined churches in posting invocations to pray for this community of 22,000 people. With media crews fanning around Roseburg to investigate and report details of Harper-Mercer’s troubled life, numbness turned to resentment as the town sensed this was what he intended: an atrocity to claim notoriety and add Roseburg to Charleston, Newtown, Aurora, Columbine – other towns hit by mass shootings. On a website called Kickass Torrents, a user believed to be Harper-Mercer noted that a disgruntled ex-television network employee in Virginia got his “face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet” after murdering former colleagues live on air last month. “So many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows,” the user wrote. Sheriff Hanlin has vowed to not name the shooter. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” he said. The Oregonian newspaper, however, criticised that stance in an editorial, saying Hanlin’s hostility to gun control was clouding investigation into what caused Harper-Mercer’s homicidal spree. “Did mental illness play a part?” the newspaper asked. “How did he get his weapons? These are relevant, uncomfortable questions that, in Hanlin’s mind, may glorify the act, but in truth they only expose the complexity of the problems we face.”"

X OUR PICKS: The tiny moment that ends the touring production of “The Events” at the Guthrie Theater puts an exclamation point on several issues with the well-meaning but awkward performance.
Inspired by a 2011 massacre in Norway, “The Events” is set in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a church. Claire, a priest, has survived but is obsessed with understanding why the shooting occurred, drawing her loved ones and her reluctant congregation into her search for answers.
The congregation will be played during the Guthrie run by several different choirs — on opening night, it was an ensemble of 20 or so from the Twin Cities Women’s Choir — who sing half a dozen songs and play supporting roles in the proceedings. 
At the end of the opening performance, Lesley Hart, who plays Claire, thanked the “wonderful” choir and then, in a gesture that drew chuckles because it made her “wonderful” seem insincere, walked halfway across the stage to pick up a Post-It note to find out the name of the wonderful choir she was thanking. 


Yes, it would be tough to remember the name of a different choir each night but there are theatrical ways to deal with that, or you could let the hard-working women introduce themselves. So the Post-It note seemed like a symbol for the whole production, which often distances the audience even as it is trying to pull us into its attempt to find healing and forgiveness in the midst of tragedy. The two leads — Hart and Clifford Samuel, who plays the shooter and several other roles, appear uncomfortable in their interactions with the choir (it can’t be easy to have new co-stars every night) and there’s a hollow quality to their acting as they slip in an out of the fragmentary scenes that make up “The Events.”
In theory, the fragments are a good idea, recalling the way we piece together events in our memories while also hinting that it’s impossible to assemble the pieces because there’s likely no way to understand where these sorts of appalling events come from (I kept thinking of John Weidman and Stephen Sondheim’s musical “Assassins,” which asks similar questions much more skilfully). But the play’s metaphors often seem facile, the actors’ practice of declaiming nearly every line straight to the audience while also ignoring us grows wearying and the scripts the choir members must carry are off-putting.
About that choir, though. They’re lovely and the women dive gamely into their roles as foils for the two leads. I’m not nuts about the way they’re used in the finale — like many an overblown Grammy Awards performance, “The Events” ends with a choir soaring in to provide musical uplift — but the group is a crucial part of the evening. “The Events”‘s banality-of-evil conclusion is no revelation but, throughout the show, the choir on stage functions as a tangible reminder that, although human beings are capable of violent and inexplicable behavior, we can also come together to create beauty and peace.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/EJsMS3RuF7M/,"When it comes to gun control laws in Florida, shooting sprees like what happened in a college campus in Oregon has Floridians discussing what to do in their own colleges. As a former Florida governor, 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush believes caution is necessary, stating that ""stuff happens, there's always a crisis."" In a related report by the Inquisitr, a recent Florida shooting left three dead and one person critically injured in the town of Inglis. The Florida shooting took place at a home near the local town hall. The recent Oregon shooting at a community college left nine people dead in the town of Roseburg. Already, the discussion has turned to more gun control laws, but while Jeb Bush calls the mass shooting ""heartbreaking"" he also says that ""more government"" wasn't ""necessarily the answer."" ""I had this challenge as governor,"" Bush said, speaking about how the state government tended to respond after a Florida shooting. ""Look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" President Barack Obama was asked about Jeb Bush's comments made at the Conservative Leadership Project, and the president indicated that the increase in mass shootings points to a problem. ""I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting,"" Obama said, according to NPR. ""And they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening.' "" In response, Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger said it was ""sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush's comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy.""  — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 2, 2015  — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 2, 2015  ""America's based on the freedom to be able to defend yourself, to defend others, and the inherent right to self defense; and for some reason, we have stripped that right as you enter a college campus,"" said Steube, who believes that it is a college student's right to wield a gun on a college campus. Curt Lavarello of the School Safety Advocacy Council disagrees, arguing that stopping a Florida shooting spree would only be made more difficult if police officers also had to deal with armed students. ""We know one thing,"" Lavarello said, according to WWSB. ""We're not going to reduce school gun violence by bringing more guns. The dynamics of a school shooting are very difficult already. I can't imagine being a police officer and having to respond to a school where the report is 'there's one bad armed person and 20 good armed people' and then having to make a split second decision."" In response, Steube argues that police officers deal with that particular problem ""everywhere else"" where Floridians are allowed to carry a gun, so he asks, ""Why can't they handle it on a college campus?"" College students are also grappling with the debate over Florida gun control laws. According to the Gainesville Sun, UF student Jeremy Youngquist believes that allowing college gun permits may help since the presence of armed students may dissuade a shooter from attacking. He also believes that gun-free zones do not help. ""My only thought is if someone wanted to bring a gun with mal-intent, they wouldn't care whether there is a law or not,"" he said. What do you think is the best approach to preventing a Florida shooting spree on college campuses? "
http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Oregon-shooting-victim-profiles-6548392.php,"PORTLAND, Ore. — The nine people killed after a gunman opened fire on an Oregon community college campus Thursday took different paths to the small rural college, ranging from teens starting college for the first time to adults who were seeking a second career. One was an assistant professor of English at the college. The worst mass shooting in Oregon history also injured several others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. The gunman died after a shootout with police. Kim Saltmarsh Dietz Dietz, 59, loved the outdoors, her 18-year-old daughter and her two Great Pyrenees dogs, said Robert Stryk, the owner of Pyrenees Vineyards in Myrtle Creek, where Dietz worked as a caretaker for many years. Dietz was taking classes at the same college as her daughter, who was unhurt in the shooting, Stryk said. “That’s really the tragedy here, is that this is a woman who was just trying to better herself,” he said. Dietz’s ex-husband, Eric, is the vineyard manager, and both were still close friends, Stryk said. Eric Dietz, who had posted updates on his Facebook page while searching for news of his daughter and ex-wife, on Friday posted a picture of Kim and confirmation of her death “with deep grief in my heart.” Lucero Alcaraz The father of 19-year-old Lucero Alcaraz fought back tears and anger outside of his Roseburg home. “There is no sense in talking about it. It’s in vain,” Ezequiel Alcaraz said in Spanish. “What’s the point in showing our pain?” Lucero’s sister, Maria Leticia Alcaraz, posted to Facebook that her sister was missing, then broke the news that she was dead. “Never in a million years would I have imagined going through something like this. She was my best friend and my sister,” she wrote. “I can’t begin to describe how I feel. I’m full of anger, pain, sadness, regret that I didn’t get the chance to see her or prevent this from happening.” Maria Leticia Alcaraz wrote of being proud of her sister for getting scholarships that would cover the entirety of her college costs, and for the fact that she was in college honors and wrote that she “would have been a great pediatric nurse.” “You were going to do great things,” she wrote. Jason Johnson Johnson, 33, had just started his first week at the college, his mother told NBC News. Tonja Johnson Engel said her son had struggled with drug abuse, but decided to continue his education after completing a six-month rehab program with The Salvation Army in Portland. “The other day, he looked at me and hugged me and said, ‘Mom, how long have you been waiting for one of your kids to go to college?’ And I said, ‘Oh, about 20 years,’” Engel told NBC. She said that her son kissed her before he left for class Thursday morning. In a family statement read by police Friday, Jason’s mother said Jason was proud of himself for enrolling in school, and so was his mom. They felt that Jason had finally found his path. Quinn Glen Cooper In a statement issued Friday, Cooper’s family wrote that “Quinn was funny, sweet, compassionate and such a wonderful loving person.” “He always stood up for people,” the statement said of Cooper, 18, of Roseburg. He was going to take his brown belt test this week, and he loved dancing and voice acting and playing Ingress with his older brother, Cody. “Our lives are shattered beyond repair,” his family wrote. We send our condolences to all the families who have been so tragically affected by this deranged gunman. No one should ever have to feel the pain we are feeling. Please remember the victims and their families. Please remember Quinn.” Lucas Eibel A statement by his family said Eibel, 18, who was studying chemistry, loved Future Farmers of America and volunteering at Wildlife Safari and Saving Grace animal shelter. “He was an amazing soccer player,” the statement read. His family also noted his academic achievements, including graduating Roseburg High School with high academic marks, receiving a Ford Family Foundation scholarship, and receiving an Umpqua Community College scholars award. Lawrence Levine Levine, 67, of Glide was an assistant professor of English at the college. Levine was a member of Steamboaters, a fly fishing and conservation group. Dale Greenley, a fellow member of the group said Levine was an avid fisherman who used to be a guide on the north Umpqua River. “He was kind of quiet and laid back, he didn’t say much,” Greenley said. “But he was a good writer.” Sarena Dawn Moore Sarena Dawn Moore of Myrtle Creek, age 44, was a member of Grants Pass Seventh-day Adventist Church, which had a post on its Facebook page mourning her death. Treven Taylor Anspach In a written statement read by officials, Anspach’s family said the 20-year-old from Sutherlin was “one of the most positive young men, always looking for the best in life.” “Treven was larger than life and brought out the best in those around him,” his family wrote. Rebecka Ann Carnes Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said Carnes, 18, of Myrtle Creek was the great-granddaughter of his first cousin. In a statement, Merkley wrote: “Rebecka’s beautiful spirit will be enormously missed.” A GoFundMe site was set up for Carnes by her cousin, Lisa Crawford at http://bit.ly/1ON5WHD to help Carnes’ parents “with Becka’s final expenses.” “I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to have watched Becka grow up,” Crawford wrote on the site. “She had just started a new job and college classes. This isn’t how life is supposed to work and I am struggling to wrap my mind around the entire situation.” Crawford asked said that the people in Carnes’ life “loved her fiercely and are devastated.” “Don’t let life ever become so busy that you don’t have a moment to stop and be kind to someone,” Crawford wrote. “Let love and gentleness shine in the wake of this violence.”"

Read Transcript Not at all Somewhat Certain Search and sort every Brewers regular season home run in the Miller Park era. ■ Before the game, the Brewers honored right-hander Jorge Lopez and shortstop Orlando Arcia, their minor-league pitcher and player of the year. Charlie Sullivan, the scout who signed Lopez, was on hand for the ceremony and will see him pitch the Brewers' season finale Sunday. Arcia went home to Venezuela so he was represented by Class AA Biloxi's Carlos Subero, who managed both players. As for Arcia, he said, ""Orlando definitely closed the gap (to the majors) with the year he put up. When he comes here, fans are going to be real excited watching him play. Orlando is somebody who loves the spotlight, and in a good way."" Beyond Lopez's obvious physical talent, Sullivan said he made it this far at age 22 because ""he's got tremendous poise, and he really always has. That's not something you can really teach."" ■ Head athletic trainer Dan Wright voiced support before the game for the citizens of Roseburg, Ore., as well as students and faculty at Umpqua Community College, where nine people were killed in a mass shooting Thursday. Wright's hometown is Roseburg and he received his associate's degree in physical education at UCC in 1982. ""For me, it hits as close to home as it can,"" said Wright. ""I didn't know any of the victims directly but I know people who knew them. It's a pretty tight-knit community. I just want to express my condolences and heart-felt wishes to the families of those who lost their lives."" ■ Brewers starter Tyler Wagner was in need of a solid outing after rough ones in his first two major-league starts (15 hits, 10 runs in 72/3 innings, 11.74 ERA). Wagner delivered the third time around, allowing seven hits and one run in six innings with two walks and three strikeouts.

The revelations also raise the question of whether the shooter's mother may have supplied him with any of the weapons he used in the Oregon mass shooting. Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Special Agent Salinas Nunez said on Thursday that of the 13 guns found in Christopher Harper-Mercer's possession, at least some were purchased legally by other family members.   Harper-Mercer, who reportedly died in a pre-planned suicide after murdering nine people at Umpqua Community College and wounding seven more, moved with his mother to Oregon two years ago, from Torrance, California. ""I moved from So. Calif. to Oregon, from Southern Crime-a-mania to open carry,"" Harper said in the Facebook posting uncovered by the news site Vocativ.com. In the same posting, the woman lists the various makes and models of guns she claims to own. ""When the mood strikes, and as long as we're tossing around brand names, I sling an AR, Tek-9 or AK over my shoulder, or holster a Glock 21 (not 22), or one of my other handguns, like the Sig Sauer P226, and walk out the door. I find the shotguns are a little too cumbersome to open carry, "" she wrote in the online comment posted in September of 2014. Harper-Mercer's parents are divorced and his father, Ian Mercer, still lives in California. On Saturday, he told CNN that he was shocked that his son — whom he said he had not seen since the move to Oregon — was a gun owner, much less the owner of 13 firearms. ""I had no idea he had any guns. I have no idea that he had any guns whatsoever,"" Mercer told the news network. ""And I'm a great believer you don't buy guns, don't buy guns, you don't buy guns.""   The Oregon shooting suspect's mother, however, apparently disagreed, and also appears to have passed on her enthusiasm for firearms to her son. A New York Times investigation into the Oregon shooter's history found that while he rarely interacted with neighbors, he could become effusive if the conversation turned to the subject of guns. ""When we talked about guns and hunting, he was real open about it,"" one neighbor, Louie Flores, 32, told the New York Times. ""But anything about what was going on in his life, he really didn't say too much at all."" Another acquaintance, Shelly Steele, told the New York Daily News that Harper-Mercer's mother took him shooting on gun ranges — but preferred ranges with minimum supervision. ""She said she had multiple guns and believed wholeheartedly in the Second Amendment and wanted to get all the guns she could before someone outlawed them,"" Steele said. ""My husband is an avid hunter and former military, so she would talk to him about it all the time, how she liked to take her son shooting."" Steele added that the Oregon shooter's mom rejected a gun range near to Umpqua Community College because it required that customers be accompanied by a range master, and Laurel Harper ""didn't like anyone watching."" But Steele also told the paper that Harper had spoken to her about her son's mental health issues, and Steele found it ""strange,"" therefore, that she would ""encourage a fascination with guns."" That fascination appears to have culminated in the Oregon mass shooting, carried out by Christopher Harper-Mercer. [Images: Scott Olson / Getty Images / CNN Screen Capture / MySpace]"
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/stephen-colbert-shoting-oregon,"Stephen Colbert started on Friday’s “Late Show” by addressing the shooting in Oregon and said that “we change nothing and pretend that it won’t happen again.” A mass shooting at an Oregon community college on Thursday morning left at least nine people dead. He began his show with a somber monologue. “In the face of the killing in Oregon yesterday, I honestly don’t know what to do or say,” he said. ”Other than our hearts are broken for the people struck by this senseless tragedy. I don’t know how to start a show like this which is often about what’s happened in the last 24 hours.” “I can’t pretend that it didn’t happen.I also can’t pretend to know what to do to prevent what happened yesterday, all of the times it has happened before,” he said before adding, “But I think pretending is part of the problem. These things happen over and over again and we are naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them — but then we change nothing and we pretend that it won’t happen again.” “Some say the answer is stricter gun laws, others say the answer is mental health care, that we need better treatment or just keep the guns out of hands of the insane. Maybe it’s both. I honestly don’t know,” he continued. “But I do know that one of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” Watch a clip of his comments:  h/t: Raw Story Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before…"

It was done by a 20-year-old male student who asked about a person's religion. Immediately many in the news media and the president of the United States of America asked for more gun control. This weapon did not kill anyone; it was the finger on the trigger. It is the criminal and sometimes people with mental problems that do these acts. Remember fists, knives, machetes, clubs and rocks are also available. When will the public wake up and start insisting on tougher and more meaningful sentences for the criminal, better identification of the mental issues involved? Until that is done, these type killings will continue. James E. Muecke, Houston Predictable Regarding ""America. The Beautiful?"" (Page B8, Friday), the saddest thing about the editorial cartoon with a giant gun imposed on the outline of the USA was my thinking that the cartoonist must have had that one already drawn, just waiting for the next massacre. Our unwillingness to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and criminals made another mass murder all too predictable. Stella Fitzgibbons, The Woodlands Video games? It occurs to me that there must be a connection between the recent spate of mass killings, to video games. I have watched my grandsons play these video games and have been appalled at the inhumanity aspect of the ""games."" The idea is to ""kill"" as many intruders as quickly as possible. Anything that appears on the screen is a ""target."" Mass killings are pretty much of the last decade. I have not seen one reference to video games in all the analyses. Perhaps the problem is not ""guns"" but ""video games!"" Thomas W. Childers, Kingwood Speak up It would seem logical that the Republican Party would be as vehement about taking a life by liberal gun laws as the loss of life by abortion. To have 10 students slaughtered at college and multiple shootings nationwide is atrocious. To take the life of the unborn is also murder, no matter what stage of development. When will we learn that life is sacred and laws are far from perfect? Ellen Marinucci, Houston"
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/04/oregon-shooting-state-universities-campus-gun-laws-concealed-carry,"Amid 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, states have moved to allow more guns on campuses. Oregon is one of a handful that allows concealed carry Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.35 BST After Thursday’s mass shooting in Oregon – the 45th school shooting in the US this year – that left nine dead, attention has focused on the state’s policy of allowing guns on college campuses. Until recently, state law allowed colleges to ban guns on campus. Most public colleges and universities in the Beaver State, including the Oregon University System, opted to do so.  In 2011, though, the Oregon court of appeals ruled that gun bans on public campuses exceeded the university’s authority. At issue was a state law declaring that only the state legislature could regulate the use, sale and possession of firearms. The following year, the Oregon state board of higher education approved a policy that banned guns from being brought inside campus buildings. However, the status of campus gun regulations has yet to be fully settled in the courts. What is clear, Erika Soto Lamb, communications director at Everytown for Gun Safety, wrote in an email, is that “Oregon law actually forces colleges to allow guns on campus grounds”. Oregon is one of fewer than a dozen states, along with more conservative counterparts like Mississippi and Utah, which allow concealed carry on college campuses. At Umpqua Community College, the site of Thursday’s tragedy, the policy change came in a meeting of the board of directors on 9 November 2011. According to the minutes, the Oregon Community College Association legal counsel “spoke about the gun law changes which affect the ability to carry a concealed weapon on campus”. As a result, the counsel noted: “If you have a concealed weapon card, the policy of the board may not restrict a person from carrying a weapon.” Umpqua’s policy soon changed to allow guns on campus, although “at the time of the shooting, Umpqua Community College had as strong a policy as Oregon law permits”, Lamb said. A frequent refrain among conservatives is that violent rampages happen in places like college campuses and movie theaters precisely because guns are banned there. The thinking goes that someone setting out to commit a massacre can select a target where he is reasonably assured not to encounter an armed citizen. (There is no evidence of a shooter ever selecting a target precisely because it is a gun-free zone.) In the Umpqua case, though, at least one student (and likely others) was carrying a concealed weapon during the massacre. Needless to say, this did not prevent the tragedy. An armed Umpqua student, John Parker Jr, explained just how difficult, if not impossible, it would have been for an armed bystander to stop the attack. “The Swat team wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they could think we were bad guys,” he told MSNBC. Another reason college administrators tend to support banning firearms on campus is insurance. A rash of state bills to allow guns in classrooms followed the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, but according to Jennifer Lynch, spokesperson at the Oregon Alliance for Gun Safety, most were ultimately voted down because insurance companies refused to cover schools with more guns or charged sky-high rates. “Insurance companies aren’t emotional or political; they look only at the risk,” she said. “They know the risk of having armed people on campus increases the risk of gun injuries and gun deaths.” School districts in Oregon, for example, have to pay an additional $2,500 premium annually per armed staff member. Banning guns on college campuses is a controversial issue, but that doesn’t mean it’s a new one. In 1824, a University of Virginia board of visitors meeting decided that “no student shall, within the precincts of the University [...] keep or use weapons or arms of any kind”. Among those at the meeting were founding fathers Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, and James Madison, widely considered the father of the US constitution, including the second amendment. Nor is the issue confined to Oregon. Though there have been 142 school shootings in the US since Sandy Hook, the trend in statehouses has moved in favor of allowing more guns on university grounds. In the past few years, Kansas, Idaho and Texas have passed laws allowing concealed weapons on campus. Professors in these states are now grappling with a new and more armed environment. After Texas passed a bill, SB11, earlier this year to permit weapons on campuses, more than 180 professors at the University of Texas signed a petition vowing to ban guns in their classrooms. Jessica Smartt Gullion, an assistant professor of sociology at Texas Woman’s University, wrote in a recent Newsweek op-ed about a student so upset over a grade as to throw a public tantrum and bring an intimidating man to the classroom as a threat. Gullion argued that because this type of situation was not unusual, allowing firearms in universities could result in violence against professors over trivial issues like a poor mark. Despite the court ruling allowing guns on Oregon campuses, the state is nevertheless viewed as a recent success story among advocates of stronger gun laws. In May of this year, Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, signed SB 941, a bill that will require background checks on private gun sales. The following month, Brown signed SB 525, which bars domestic violence offenders from possessing firearms. The measures, which came after a 2012 shooting in a Portland-area mall left three dead, including the shooter, were passed despite opposition from the National Rifle Association. Lynch said that while there was no current legislation to overturn Oregon’s campus-carry ruling, “given that this is the second school shooting in Oregon in the last 18 months, this discussion will almost certainly come back up”."

Immediately after news broke, an all too familiar political dance started. Without knowing anything about the shooter, how the gun was obtained or any of the facts other than vague reports, pro- and anti-gun control advocates took their standard positions. President Barack Obama even went on television to denounce the lack of gun control laws and political inaction after prior mass shootings. Late in the evening we learned the name of the shooter, but not much about him. Early reports in such emergency situations often are inaccurate. In other mass shootings, the shooters’ motivations have varied, from racism to religion to anti-religion. There has not been a single common theme, except for one. In almost all mass shooting situations, particularly at schools, the common theme is a gun-free zone, with the shooter being the only one armed person in the building for minutes or longer. And in each case, the shooter couldn’t care less about the gun-free nature of the building, and if anything, was drawn to such a location.  More Tweets » More RCP Video Highlights »"

The Washington Post reports that all the four students who have been arrested by the local police are male students who had been preparing detailed plans about going on a killing spree in their Summerville High School for days.  According to Tuolumne County Sheriff Jim Mele, when the police raided the houses of three of the four students, who apparently all hail from California, they were stunned to find clues and paperwork which were ""very detailed in nature and included the names of victims, locations, and methods in which the plan was to be carried out."" Mele further told NBC that the four students had been emboldened to carry out their ghastly attack after witnessing a surge in mass shootings across USA during the past few years.    The officials also spoke of the need of small communities such as that of Tuolumne to stick together if the country was to successfully thwart violence inflicted by young people who were increasingly taking to guns in a bid to overcome their psychological and social problems.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/someone-can-make-a-change-on-guns-you/2248326,"Editor's note: After the killing of nine people at an Oregon community college on Thursday, President Obama gave an emotional speech in which he admitted he was politically powerless to do something about the lack of gun control in America, but pointed out there was one group that could — the nation's voters. The following is a slightly condensed transcript of Obama's remarks: There's been another mass shooting in America — this time, in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families — moms, dads, children — whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children. In the coming days, we'll learn about the victims — young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who's grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America — next week, or a couple of months from now. It's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ""The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws — even in the face of repeated mass killings."" And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country — they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws — including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America. So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And, of course, what's also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic. I would ask news organizations — because I won't put these facts forward — have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports. We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be? This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives. So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations, doesn't make sense. So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back. And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change."

http://feeds.cbsnews.com/~r/CBSNewsMain/~3/H3VZq1Kjszo/,"A priest is determined to find forgotten victims of the Holocaust whose bodies lie in unmarked mass graves in the former USSR The following is a script from ""The Hidden Holocaust"" which aired on October 4, 2015. Lara Logan is the correspondent. Alan Goldberg, producer. The Holocaust is marked and memorialized at places like Auschwitz, Bergen Belsen, Dachau.  But nearly half of the six million Jewish victims were executed in fields and forests and ravines, places that were not named and remain mostly unmarked today. They were slaughtered in mass shootings and buried in mass graves in the former Soviet Union, where until very recently, little had been done to find them. Our story is about a man who's brought these crimes of the Holocaust to light.  He is not a historian, or a detective or a Jew.  He's a French Catholic priest named Father Patrick Desbois. And for the past 13 years, he has been tracking down the sites where many of the victims lie and searching for witnesses who are still alive; many of whom had never been asked before to describe the horrors they had seen more than 70 years ago. Father Desbois: The general order was to eliminate the last Jew, even the baby, even the old mommy. They never left anybody. Lara Logan: So it was a policy of total annihilation. Father Desbois: Total annihilation. And if Hitler didn't lose the war, I think today will not be one Jew alive. Father Patrick Desbois is on a mission across Eastern Europe to find Hitler's hidden killing fields. Before him lies a continent of extermination. Lara Logan: These mass graves and extermination sites, many of them are invisible? Father Desbois: Yeah totally invisible. Under a corn field, under house, under a tomato field, yeah, yeah. Lara Logan: And many of them would never be recorded. Father Desbois: And never be recorded and still buried like animals. We traveled with Father Desbois to the former Soviet Republic of Moldova, where in one day he took us to four unmarked mass graves. In this field, he told us, 60 Jews beneath this farm, 100 above this city, under this hill, a thousand. Lara Logan: A thousand bodies, do you think they're still here? Father Desbois: Yeah, yeah, they're still here. Thousands of eyewitnesses, millions of documents and 15 years of investigating have led him to more than 1,700 execution sites.  Once in Ukraine, under the supervision of a rabbi, he excavated one. Jewish tradition forbids moving the dead once buried and the evidence was just beneath the surface. Father Desbois: And, it was officially a place where no Jew have been killed, and we found 17 mass graves. Lara Logan: And what did you find when you excavated? Father Desbois: You find everything. You see a mother with handing his boy until the end. And the boy try to go out. You see that another one was buried alive so she had the mouth open because she was buried with the earth. In June, 1941, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. Just behind his frontline troops were mobile death squads known as the Einsatzgruppen, whose job was to hunt down every last Jew. They methodically entered villages, rounded up Jewish families, and marched them to freshly dug graves. Some of the remains are buried beneath this mound in Lithuania. The assassins reached even the most remote corners, like Hiriseni, a tiny village in Moldova. Lara Logan: So when the killers came here, they really had only one purpose. Father Desbois: Only one goal: Kill the Jews and the Gypsies. Only one goal always. The village is virtually unchanged since the Nazis stormed through here.  Father Desbois' team had gone ahead of us, searching for eyewitnesses to a 70-year-old crime. They were led to an 85-year-old named Gheorghe, still working in this vineyard.  Father Desbois told us the first question they ask is always the same... Father Desbois: ""Were you here during the war?"" And if the person says, ""Yes,"" say, ""Oh, you can help us."" Gheorghe was eleven years old then. And he still remembers what he witnessed. Gheorghe: As soon as they came, they locked everyone up. I saw them taking them away. He asked him where the Jews were killed. Gheorghe: It's a ravine over there, come and see if you want. Lara Logan: So what you're learning here is completely unrecorded? Father Desbois: Yeah, if we didn't come, we'll never know they killed Jews. These Jews would have never been counted as dead, never known, and the mass grave is totally unknown. Gheorghe brought us down this road where, he said, all the Jewish families from the village were taken. He told us the day of the shooting he was tending to cows nearby.  Now 70 years later, we watched as he traced the victims steps to the edge of the ravine. Gheorghe: The Jews were facing the ditch, so they were shooting them in the back of their heads or their backs to fall into the ditch. They were shooting them as if they were dogs.  Lara Logan: He said it was a beautiful day exactly-- Father Desbois: A beautiful day-- Lara Logan: --like this one. Father Desbois: --like today. Lara Logan: With the sunshine. Father Desbois: With the sunshine, yeah. Lara Logan: When you're doing this, when you're here and in a place like this, do you ever stop and think how did I get here? Father Desbois: No, always I say to people, ""Finally we found you. Finally we came back."" Father Desbois leads no congregation, he considers his search for these Jewish victims his calling. Lara Logan: You're not your typical priest. Father Desbois: I don't know if there is a typical priest. I think everybody has to make his way. The pope also is not a typical pope. But he's a pope. And I'm not a typical priest. But I am a priest. With the blessing of his cardinal and the Vatican, he created, in 2004, the organization Yahad-In Unum, ""Together as One."" Father Desbois:  We began, so the first thing is to get the map... Based in Paris, his team begins by combing through millions of pages of German documents; comparing them to Soviet archives that only became available after the collapse of the Soviet Union. They search for clues that lead them to villages where witnesses point them to mass graves. They always record and archive the witness testimonies.  [Woman Witness: The day we came to see they brought a lot of Jews here...] To date, they have recorded over 4,000 witnesses who were children at the time. [Oleksiy, Ukraine: The Germans started to drink and after, they fired again over the pit.] Many were recruited by the Nazis or local police to dig the mass graves or to take the gold teeth, jewelry and clothing of the victims. [Vladimir, Ukraine: The pit was barely covered so we could even see their legs and arms.] [Jan, Poland: We could see the blood bubbling.] [Anna, Ukraine: They were screaming, the children were crying. When the pit was full they filled it with little earth. For three days the ground moved.  Some were still alive.] Lara Logan: What have we learned about the Holocaust that we didn't know before you began your investigations? Father Desbois: I learned a lot about humanity. I learned everybody can be a killer, anybody can be a victim. I learned that you like to see other people dying in front of you, killed by other people, when you are sure you will not be killed. It was a dramatic finding: that villagers chose to watch people being lined up and murdered; a revelation he would never have come to were it not for his grandfather Claudius Desbois. He was held as a prisoner of war in a Nazi camp in the Ukrainian village of Rawa Ruska. But he never wanted to talk about it. Father Desbois was drawn to the village to find out what happened there. He made repeated trips, but no one would talk to him, until one night when the mayor took him to the edge of the forest where 50 elderly villagers were waiting. Father Desbois: And he said, ""Patrick, I bring you at the mass grave of the last 1,500 Jews of Rawa Ruska."" Like in a movie. Lara Logan: One by one, they told you their stories, what they witnessed. Father Desbois: Fifty. Lara Logan: Fifty of them. Father Desbois: And me, I couldn't bear it. I stopped them I-- everyone in the middle. I say, ""Ah, it's enough. It's enough. The pieces of woman in the tree, it's enough. It's enough for you."" And they cried, and they went. I found finally what my grandfather never say. I say, ""They shot the Jews in public, and everybody knew. And surely my grandfather saw that."" And-- but that's it. I was in total shock. Lara Logan: You believed that the Jews were killed in secret. Father Desbois: Yeah, because everybody told me, and I have read many books about the secret of Holocaust. And in Soviet Union, everybody told me they knew nothing and-- because it was secret. What he learned disturbed him. The killings were spectacles; they took place in broad daylight, in front of entire villages. Father Desbois: They were fighting to have a good place like for circus. Lara Logan: There's no way you couldn't have known. Father Desbois: Not only that, but they were running when they heard when they were killing Jews, to see, to try to catch a coin, to check out your clothes, to take a picture. They wanted to be there. This photo of a mass shooting is from the Imperial War Museum Archives in London, dated September 14, 1941. Father Desbois: And it's a ditch. Here we have a woman with a child. You don't see any spectators, but Father Desbois suspected the crowd was just outside the frame. He followed the picture to the town of Dubassary and it brought him to the home of 81-year-old, Anatoli who was 8 back then.  He said he was at the massacre, alongside his mother. Anatoli:We were standing somewhere here. And here were the trenches, here they were falling. The carnage lasted two weeks. Dimitri, then 16, said he was there too.  He told us he watched from a tree as the Nazis and collaborators fired on groups of 20 people at a time. Father Desbois: And he thinks how many Jews have been killed like that? Dimitri: It was about 18-and-a-half thousand people-- A number much higher than the official records; which doesn't surprise Father Desbois who says the death tolls are often under reported. The bodies are right behind Dimitri's house in these 11 mass graves...one of the few Jewish sites in Eastern Europe that's marked and protected. Father Desbois: I never saw one like that among the 1,700 extermination sites where I've been. No one has shined more light on this dark chapter than Father Desbois according to Paul Shapiro, the director of the Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, who also sits on Yahad's scientific board. Paul Shapiro: The method that he's used, extraordinary. We can understand minute-by-minute what happened in hundreds of localities where before we just had fog.  Lara Logan: How reliable is his work? Paul Shapiro: He has opened the door to the use of multiple sources to understand what really happened on the ground in a big part of Europe. Father Desbois: The babies were shot too? We found Father Desbois a cautious and skeptical interviewer. Dimitri: When a woman with a baby would approach the pit, they forced her to hold the baby in sight, first they shot the baby and then her. He never judged or showed emotion as he listened to the darkest accounts of humanity.  And if he suspected a witness was holding back or lying he returned to question them again. Father Desbois insists that every killing site they find is memorialized by recording the GPS coordinates. They never physically mark the graves because he says people would loot them. Father Desbois believes when his work is finished the number of Jewish victims will total more than has been previously documented. But the number, he says, is less important than giving meaning to their lives. Sometimes in a small village, he'll find a witness, like 80-year-old Anatoly, who remembers not only the death of his Jewish neighbors but their names. [Anatoly:Brick, Gorovich, Shurman, and Folst.] Father Desbois: It's like if he was waiting for us in 70 years and now we are here. Every time I come with my team, I say, ""They are waiting for us."" Lara Logan: It did seem like he was waiting for you-- Father Desbois: Yup. Like the dead. Lara Logan's bold, award-winning reporting from war zones has earned her a prominent spot among the world's best foreign correspondents. Logan began contributing to 60 Minutes in 2005.

But while spineless lawmakers on Capitol Hill, cowed by the gun lobby, stand in the way of sensible change, at least a few states are moving to try to prevent some of the gun violence that kills 89 Americans each day in murders, suicides and accidents. USA TODAY Gun control is killing us: Opposing view The most basic, common-sense strategy is expanding background checks to include virtually all sales of guns, not just those sold by federally licensed dealers. A gap in the federal law allows buyers at gun shows and online to avoid the background checks. That's a huge loophole for felons, fugitives, drug users, the mentally ill or people prone to domestic violence. Since the fatal shootings in December 2012 of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Conn., six states — Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, New York, Washington and most recently Oregon — have expanded background checks to virtually all guns sold, no matter the venue. Nevada will vote on a similar initiative next year, and groups led by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are pushing an initiative in Maine. Are such laws a panacea? Of course not. The Roseburg suspect, Chris Harper-Mercer, managed to obtain an arsenal of 14 firearms legally. Some he bought, some were purchased by family members, according to a federal official. But even Harper-Mercer's father said the massacre ""wouldn't have happened"" if his son hadn't been able to buy so many guns. California has had expanded checks for all guns since 1990 and has cut its firearm mortality rate almost in half, according to one 2012 study done for the Brady Campaign. A wide array of evidence shows that states with more guns have more gun deaths and more police officers killed on duty.   States with tighter gun laws have fewer gun-related deaths. Average Americans have a lot more sense than the 45 U.S. senators who stood in the way of a federal gun-safety measure in April 2013, when the nation’s wounds from Newtown were still raw and stricter controls appeared to have the best chance in decades to pass. Those senators are out of step with the country. A vast majority of Americans favor expanded checks, including 88% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans, according to a Pew poll in July. Similarly, nearly 80% favor laws that would prevent the mentally ill from buying guns. But existing federal background checks prevent only a tiny slice of this population — those ruled mentally defective or involuntarily committed by a judge to a mental institution  — from buying guns. The most helpful strategy would give family members, who often know better than anyone else when someone’s mental state is deteriorating, an avenue to separate that person from guns. Again, states are leading the way. California passed a law, backed by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, last year that gives families or police a way to get a gun violence restraining order.  If a judge agrees the person presents a credible risk for violence, that person could be barred from buying guns and have any guns he owns taken away. Other advanced nations haven’t needed repeated massacres at schools, colleges, recruiting stations, churches and movie theaters to do something about gun violence. After 35 people were killed by a lone gunman wielding a military-style semiautomatic rifle at a popular Australian resort in 1996, Australia tightened every aspect of its gun laws. The USA now has 20 times the rate of homicides by firearm as Australia. Gun rights advocates can always point to some flaw in whatever sensible measure is debated or passed, or argue that it would not have stopped some particular gunman from some particular mass killing. But  just because you can't prevent every mass shooting doesn't mean you shouldn't try to stop any of them. A majority of Americans and a handful of states are on the right track. If more would follow, fewer communities would be added to the roster of sorrow that includes Columbine, Newtown, Aurora and now Roseburg.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/TheInquisitrEntertainment/~3/rif5TUZHJus/,"With George H. W. Bush healing up after a taking a nasty fall during this summer, the former U.S. president is starting to feel active again. The former first lady, Barbara Bush, says she is ""thrilled"" by his progress and she is looking forward to his full recovery. In a related report by the Inquisitr, the Oregon shooting started a debate in Florida on whether college students should be armed with weapons in order to prevent such future tragedies. As the former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush gave his input about gun control laws, but some claimed he made a political gaffe when he referred to the mass shooting as ""stuff happens."" Unfortunately, stuff does happen as George H. W. Bush found out the hard way. Back in July, the former president fractured his C2 vertebra, which is the one located directly below the skull. The family has declined to provide details of how Bush fell down at Walker's Point. At the time, doctors said that it normally takes three to four months for such an injury to heal, but Bush has already been doing activities like visiting biker bars and going out on speedboats - albeit when the sea not too rough, and with his doctor's permission. Chief of staff Jean Becker believes the nation's oldest living president is making great progress, and with George H. W. Bush ""healing nicely,"" there is already talk of their future plans. Normally, the former president heads south for the winter after spending summer in Maine, so the family plans on heading to Texas this week. Becker also reports that former first lady Barbara Bush is pleased with the progress made so far. ''She is just thrilled that he has recovered the way he has. They're at the end of this road. It was a scary thing when it happened, and he's almost back to 100 percent,'' Becker said, according to the Associated Press. In addition to bikers and speed boats, George H. W. Bush also made a surprise visit to students at Philips Academy in Massachusetts, where Bush graduated from the prep school way back in 1942. Bush told students their school ""meant so much to me in my life."" The elder Bush attended a screening of a documentary on his life titled ""41on41,"" which features 41 speakers talking about the former U.S. president. Barbara Bush also attended the screen of the documentary since she was one of the 41 storytellers who speak in the film, along with family members, world leaders, sports figures and White House staffers.  — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) October 1, 2015  — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) October 1, 2015  — Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) October 4, 2015  — Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) October 4, 2015 "
http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Ayuero-If-we-don-t-push-back-now-on-campus-6547171.php,"A doctor and his patient are leaving the grounds of an infamous mental asylum. They have just visited the psychiatric ward that houses some of the worst cases of schizophrenia. The patient, visibly shocked, tells the doctor: ""I fear I won't be able to forget."" The doctor replies, ""Don't worry, you will forget."" Perplexed, the patient looks at him, and adds, ""I fear that, too; I fear I will forget."" The sentiments behind this scene mirror what many felt when Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB 11, also known as the ""campus carry"" law, earlier this year. The law, which becomes effective Aug. 1, 2016, for public colleges and universities (Aug. 1, 2017, for community colleges), provides that license holders may carry concealed handguns in university buildings and classrooms, extending the reach of a previous law that allowed concealed handguns on university grounds. Shouldn't we - faculty, staff and students at the University of Texas at Austin and other state colleges and universities - just forget and carry on, pretending this is not an issue, writing it off as another instance of ""how things are here (in Texas),"" becoming proverbial ostriches hiding our heads in the sand? I fear that, given the letter of the law and the limited exceptions that it allows, we will have to get used to guns inside our classrooms. I fear that the fact of sharing a classroom with students ""packing heat"" will stop shocking us as it now does. I fear I should not even be writing this as many gun-rights activists take reactions to the extreme when an opposing view is offered. And I fear our senses will become dulled (again) to horrific news like Thursday's, when a gunman opened fire on an Oregon community college, killing nine and wounding 20 before being killed himself. What would be the point if, after all, we comply and learn to conform? Because I believe that classrooms should be gun-free zones, this state of affairs saddens me. It also saddens me because it will irrevocably hurt a university that for the past two decades has worked hard to become a top institution of higher education. But even as UT President Greg Fenves works with us to develop a policy for implementation of campus carry, the new law not only saddens; it also presents a puzzle. Could I now, in good conscience, attempt to persuade a prospective graduate student or faculty (the ""top talent"" the university seeks to attract) to join us ostriches? I don't think I can. Another law passed by the Legislature this year (SB 273) might prevent me from hanging a sign stating ""no guns allowed""; the law might even forbid me from stating in my syllabus that I won't allow guns. To what extent that conflicts with ""free speech"" is another - but, at least for me, less important - legal matter. The moral dilemma is this: Does the law force me to lie? Shouldn't I tell prospective students and faculty that I am, in fact, profoundly afraid and that they should think twice about joining us? In my mind, as in those of many faculty members here and around the country, guns do not belong in classrooms. No legislation can force us to lie, can it? ""Don't tell,"" won't do it. So, if we are true to ourselves, the law will effectively prevent us from recruiting highly sought-after faculty and students. Alternatively, we could agree to ""refuse to forget"" about SB 11. We could manifest our opposition and, if necessary, refuse to teach in classrooms where guns are allowed. Should we hang signs stating that we don't allow guns - at the risk, as many a lawyer already warned us, of being fined? Shouldn't parents of UT students be writing letters to university administrators and legislators expressing their worries about the one (heavily) documented effect this bill will have - i.e., making campuses less-safe places? As a parent, I wouldn't want my own sons to attend this university. My students also express their hesitancy to tell their parents about this new development (""If I tell my mother, she will transfer me""). I've been around guns (big and small). I served in the military, and I do research on interpersonal violence. The evidence coming both from social science and from law enforcement shows that more guns (on campus, and elsewhere) does not increase public safety. We knew that before the campus-carry law passed, and we know it now. With campus carry, social, political or academic interactions will have the potential to explode in lethal violence. I can dwell on the arguments, I can show numbers, piles of evidence, case studies and experiments all confirming these facts. (I should add that Oregon, site of Thursday's mass shooting, is one of the seven states that now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses. No, packing does not prevent these things from happening.) But the campus-carry debate in the Legislature was not about logical, evidence-based, argumentation. Had it been about logic and evidence, the reasons persuasively put forward by UT Chancellor William H. McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, and Art Acevedo, chief of the Austin Police Department - both of whom know a thing or two about the subject and who argued against campus carry - would have been heeded. Lawmakers did not examine their arguments or anyone else's because the ""debate"" was not about reason but about interests - the legislators' interests and those of the organizations that support them. They, folks who neither teach nor do research, enacted a law that makes no sense for any the parties affected, and now we have to deal with the consequences. So, in this same spirit (not of reason-giving but of defending personal and organizational interests), let me express my hope that the university will make provisions to protect the interests of the students, staff and faculty who want to work, teach and learn in safe classrooms, gun-free environments where everybody can freely express his or her ideas without fear. Ostriches, no more.  Auyero is the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, where he directs the Urban Ethnography Lab.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/10/04/hillary-clinton-gun-control_n_8242354.html,"Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton called Monday for substantial new limits on the availability and distribution of firearms, stepping aggressively into the debate over gun control in the wake of last week's mass shooting at a community college in Oregon. The former secretary of state outlined four specific proposals during a pair of town hall events in New Hampshire, all of which are sure to inspire intense opposition from gun rights advocates. One of the proposals puts her directly at odds with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her top competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination. At the top of the list is a pledge to take administrative action if Congress fails to tighten the so-called gun show and Internet sales loopholes. Under current law, licensed dealers are required to conduct background checks and certify that potential buyers are not prohibited from owning guns. But unlicensed vendors, including some individual sellers at gun shows, don’t have to go through these steps. Clinton called for lawmakers to address the issue. But if they don't, she would require that anyone “attempting to sell a significant number of guns be deemed ‘in the business of selling firearms,’” which would “ensure that high-volume gun sellers are covered by the same common sense rules that apply to gun stores -- including requiring background checks on gun sales.” Asked what would constitute “a significant number of guns,” a Clinton aide responded, “There are a number of studies being conducted currently regarding illegal gun sales that could inform an eventual rulemaking.” Such an administrative action would be a bold step, one bound to spark massive pushback. And it’s not clear how it would legally work. President Barack Obama said at a recent press conference he had exhausted all the tools available to him to strengthen gun control laws. Clinton’s campaign did not elaborate as to what legal avenues it is exploring. Clinton's second proposal would close a gap in the current background check process that “allows a gun sale to proceed without a completed background check if that check is not complete within three days.” The so-called “Charleston Loophole” has been pinpointed as a contributing factor in the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in the South Carolina city in June, though some have also argued that the shooter would have been stopped from obtaining a gun had there simply been better communication between state and federal agencies. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C) has introduced a bill to end that ""default proceed"" rule. Clinton also called for legislation that prohibits domestic abusers from buying and possessing firearms. Such a bill has already been introduced in the Senate, where it has had a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Similar legislation has been pushed in state legislatures as well, where the National Rifle Association has notably backed down from the fight. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, nearly 12,000 convicted stalkers can legally purchase firearms in the U.S. Finally, Clinton called for a repeal of the legal immunity that gun manufacturers and dealers currently enjoy under a 2005 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This could be the most politically provocative of the four proposals. Not only is the immunity a prized possession of the NRA, but it is something that Sanders voted for while a member of the House of Representatives. Clinton, who was a senator representing New York at the time, voted against it. Sanders has defended his vote by arguing that the alternative would be akin to punishing a hammer-maker if someone used a hammer as a weapon. But gun control advocates argue that the law opens the door to negligent manufacturers who don't fear being penalized when their firearms flood a community or market. Clinton’s gun control push doesn’t appear to be an attempt to out-progressive Sanders so much as a thorough rethinking of how to patch up a hole-laden system of gun laws. Still, even with these offerings, she will probably fall short of another Democrat in the race. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has released a four-point plank of his own, which he called on both Sanders and Clinton to endorse on Sunday: Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/y9-ydAdN_nc/,"After last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, a hero rose above the gunfire. CNN may have focused its voyeurism upon the shooter, but army veteran Chris Mintz became the name that truly mattered in the tragedy that killed 10 people and wounded many others. Mintz sustained several gunshot wounds and will have to relearn to walk, yet he saved countless lives. The Internet will not forget Mintz’s heroism. Thousands of people have signed a petition to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a U.S. civilian: “I am recommending Mr. Chris Mintz for the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his actions taken on 1 October 2015 during the shootings at the Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Mr. Mintz, a Veteran, continues to display the values of the United States military by his actions to alert others of the danger and then to endanger himself while delaying the attacker to allow time for others to escape. Mr. Mintz positively displayed the values of loyalty, duty, respect, honor, integrity, personal courage, and self-sacrifice to attempt to save as many of his fellow citizens as possible. I believe that awarding Mr. Mintz the Presidential Medal of Freedom will hold him up as a strong example to the rest of America that one person can make a difference.” Over an otherwise slow Internet weekend, the petition quietly gathered nearly 6,000 signatures. The total number needed for Mintz to receive the medal is 100,000, but the effort is hard at work on Facebook. Hopefully the petition will ultimately be successful before its expiration date of November 1. No doubt, President Obama would feel it proper for Mintz to receive this highest of honors.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/05/the_conservative_evasion_on_guns_128304.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama spoke some of the most important words of his tenure last week in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. ""This is something we should politicize,"" the president said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" This is something we should politicize. His statement was remarkable for violating the etiquette as to what a leader should say after another slaughter by a deranged gunman and the conventional wisdom about how politicians have to pretend that they are not engaged in politics. But Obama was forcing us to face reality. It's politics that has rendered our nation powerless in the face of butchery. There have been at least 142 school shootings since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, and Congress has done nothing. It's politics, as Obama said, that makes the U.S. ""the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,"" and politics that leads our learned legislators to pass laws barring the government from ""even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths."" Imagine: Congress has legislated mandatory ignorance. ""Politicize"" is the right word for another reason: We will not act until politicians start losing elections for opposing even the most modest gun safety measure. We will not act unless political parties that block action lose their majorities. Yes, I am talking about a Republican Party that has completely aligned itself with the interests of gun manufacturers and gun fanatics. I have criticized timid Democrats for doing the NRA's bidding, and they need to be challenged in primaries, even if this means putting some of the party's seats in Congress at risk. But it is the GOP that is institutionally tied to those who insist that gun rights supersede all of our other rights. And I cordially invite House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prove me wrong. Engaging in politics also means unmasking rationalizations that may sound plausible but are merely intended to justify pathetic pandering to the forces of evasion and inertia. The most debilitating dodge is to claim that nothing can be done, that nothing works. The gun lobby specializes in isolating a given incident and declaring sagely that this or that particular solution would not have prevented it. News flash: No law will ever solve every problem or create heaven on Earth. But it is a straight-out lie to assert that stronger gun laws make no difference. Here is the conclusion of a study released in August by National Journal: ""The states that impose the most restrictions on gun users also have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths, while states with fewer regulations typically have a much higher death rate from guns."" State laws could be even more effective if they were matched by federal laws that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands. Politicians who go on about American greatness should be ashamed of saying that the United States is the one and only nation that can't act effectively to solve a problem every other free and democratic country has contained. Conservatives might usefully listen to former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who has noted that he led ""a center-right coalition"" whose parties represented ""virtually every non-urban electoral district in the country."" In other words, his party is a lot like our Republicans. After a psychologically disturbed man killed 35 people in Tasmania, Howard championed state bans on the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons by Australia's states along with a federal ban on their importation. He also sponsored a gun buy-back scheme that got 700,000 guns -- the statistical equivalent of 40 million in the U.S. -- off the streets and destroyed. ""Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control,"" Howard wrote in The New York Times shortly after the Newtown killings. Politicizing this struggle means being unrelentingly candid in calling out an American conservative movement that proudly champions law and order but allows itself to be dominated by gun extremists who deride every gun measure that might make our country a little bit safer -- no matter how many mass killings we have. Conservatives all over the world are aghast at our nation's permissive attitude toward guns. Is a dangerous and harebrained absolutism about weaponry really the issue on which American conservatives want to practice exceptionalism?

Last week’s events were very tragic, and all Americans are mourning with the residents of Oregon. But most Americans find it very offensive to hear the president use a tragedy like this and instantly turn it into a political opportunity. USA TODAY States lead on gun background checks: Our view The White House is calling for “common sense” gun control, which is insane, given that the criminally minded don’t obey the law. Every public mass shooting since 1950, except for two, has occurred in a gun-free zone. This shooting is no different. The Umpqua Community College is a gun-free zone, as are the locations of many recent shootings: the Lafayette, La., theater; the Charleston, S.C., church; the military recruiting center in Tennessee. Guns were outlawed at all these locations, and yet the killers ignored the bans. Plus, the shooters passed background checks — as did the Oregon shooter, who passed several background checks in purchasing his firearms. Albert Einstein defined “insanity” as doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. Clearly, the call for more gun control is insane — it doesn’t work. And that is why Gun Owners of America agrees with the 86% of police who say these types of incidents would be prevented if the potential victims were not disarmed. Consider just a partial list of the locations where armed citizens have stopped bad guys in their tracks over the past year: in a bar in Youngstown, Ohio; on a street corner in Chicago; at a barber shop in Philadelphia; in a church in Florida; at a food processing plant in Oklahoma; and at a hospital in Darby, Pa. And then, there was the attempted mass shooting in 2012 at the Clackamas mall in Oregon. When a gunman began killing people in the mall, Nick Meli drew his concealed firearm and pointed it at the gunman, thus spooking him into taking his own life. Nick Meli was breaking the “no guns policy” at the mall, but there are many survivors who are glad he did. Gun-free zones are the problem. Let’s repeal them. Erich Pratt is the director of communications for Gun Owners of America."

Maybe these businesses should consider this type of sign: “CCL holders welcome. Show us your license and receive a 10% discount on your purchase.” Now, if you were a criminal, which store would you choose to invade? I thought so. Marty Esposito; Robinson, Texas Once again the tragedy of gun violence continues in our nation. Three years ago, when 20 children and six teachers lost their lives in the Sandy Hook school shooting, I believed that the common sense would finally prevail. At that time Vice President Biden, with the full support of President Obama, took the lead in crafting a plan for modest gun control. Although I was disappointed that the legislation fell somewhat short of universal background checks for any gun purchase, I felt that it was positive legislation, and 80% of our citizens supported its passage. It was defeated by the National Rifle Association and those elected officials under its control.

On Monday, Clinton is announcing a push for tougher gun laws days after another mass shooting, as Republicans shrug off such calls.

October 5, 2015 Four students were arrested after detectives uncovered a plot to carry out a shooting at their Northern California high school, authorities said. The plot – which officials described as “very detailed in nature and included names of would be victims, locations, and the methods in which the plan was to be carried out” – was foiled Wednesday after a group of students told a teacher they overheard three of the four talking about opening fire on Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif., about 120 miles east of San Francisco, The New York Times reported. The teacher alerted school administrators, who immediately removed the three from their classrooms and called the police, said Robert Griffith, the superintendent of the Summerville Union High School District. “Within two to three minutes, those administrators got up out of their seat, recognizing the severity of the information that they received, and were in the classroom pulling those students out,” Mr. Griffith said at a news conference Saturday. The fourth suspect was identified during the investigation, said Sheriff James W. Mele of Tuolumne County at the news conference. Detectives on Friday arrested all four students on charges of conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons and turned them over to the Tuolumne County Probation Department, The Modesto Bee reported. The suspects’ names were not released because they are juveniles, though officials said they were all male. While no weapons were recovered, Sheriff Mele said the students were in the process of obtaining some to carry out the attack. He did not identify a motive. “They were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible on the campus,” Mele told the Bee. “It is particularly unsettling when our most precious assets – which are our students, their teachers – are targets for violence.” The students were arrested just days after a mass shooting at a community college in rural Oregon that left 10 people dead, including the gunman. ""It is clear from past history, such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against fellow students and teachers on school grounds,"" said Eric Hovatter, Tuolumne County assistant district attorney, according to KCRA. ""While it is easy to say that can never happen in Tuolumne County, the public and local law enforcement must be vigilant, as they were here.""

Every Monday In the Greater Philadelphia region, the FBI has warned college students to stay vigilant after 'threatened violence.' Could a posting on 4chan be responsible? Loading... October 5, 2015 After the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Philadelphia-area colleges are on high alert Monday because of “threatened violence,” according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). “Out of an abundance of caution, the FBI Philadelphia Field Office notified local colleges and universities of a social media posting which threatened violence at a Philadelphia-area college or university for Monday, October 5,” the agency said in a statement. “No specific college or university was identified in the posting. We encourage students, faculty, and employees at area colleges and universities to follow the guidance of their campus security officials. The FBI will continue to work with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to investigate threats of violence, and, as always, we ask the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.” Across the Greater Philadelphia region, colleges have disseminated alerts warning students to stay vigilant. While the FBI has not confirmed where they found the threat, some reports have linked to this posting on 4chan, an anonymous imageboard site. The post says on Monday at 1 p.m. Central Time, “a fellow robot will take up arms against a university near Philadelphia. His cries will be heard, his victims will cower in fear, and the strength of the Union will decay a little more. If you are in that area, you are encouraged to stay at home and watch the news as the chaos unfolds. His sacrifice will echo throughout the nation.” On Thursday, nine people were killed and nine more were injured after a classmate opened fire in his writing class at the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Ore. Federal law enforcement also investigated a 4chan thread in relation to the massacre, according to the New York Times. The day before that rampage, local detectives thwarted a potential massacre at a high school near Yosemite National Park. Three students were arrested and a fourth was detained for plotting to target specific classmates and teachers. But some are questioning the legitimacy of the Philadelphia threat. 4chan is known as a bastion of cyber-pranksters, and the site’s users have a long history of wreaking havoc – sometimes in the name of vigilantism. Its users are considered highly influential and tech-savvy, leading some to claim it “controls the Internet.” 4chan is responsible for the celebrity nude photo leak scandal, the self-harm hashtag #cuttingforBieber, and gaming the Time 100 poll, putting the site's founder, Christopher ""moot"" Poole, in the top spot. Recently, the personal contact information for Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who raised the price of a drug by 5,000 percent and became “the most hated man in America,” was posted on 4chan. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. And The Washington post called 4chan users’ attempts to convince West Africans that Ebola doctors were worshipping the disease a “cross between a prank, a witless joke and a truly vile strain of racism.” The site is also credited with spawing the “hacktivist” group Anonymous, which has targeted government agencies and corporations in the name of justice.

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/john-hanlin-sandy-hook-conspiracy,"The pro-gun sheriff in charge of investigating a mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College said Friday that he doesn’t subscribe to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting “truther” movement, despite having posted a video raising questions about the tragedy to his Facebook page. “I know what you’re referring to, but that’s not a conspiracy theory that I have,” Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told CNN late Friday when asked about the video. Hanlin posted a link in January 2013 to a YouTube video called “The Sandy Hook Shooting – Fully Exposed,” which summarized conspiracy theories surrounding the shooting and quickly went viral.  Hanlin posted the link about a month after the massacre of elementary school children in Newtown, Connecticut. “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore…” Hanlin wrote. “Watch, listen, and keep an open mind.” The Facebook post was removed from public view Friday afternoon after news outlets, including TPM, reported on it. Two days after posting the video, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden stating that he did not believe stricter gun control measures would prevent potential mass shootings. That letter earned him praise from a fringe “constitutional sheriffs” organization.

http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/watch-john-oliver-explain-broken-u-s-mental-health-systems-20151005,"Welcome, “The vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent,” says ‘Last Week Tonight’ host. “And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people” Reporter “It seems there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health,” John Oliver says in his latest Last Week Tonight report, referencing the endless arguments about gun control/mental illness circulating after the Oregon tragedy, the 264th mass shooting of the year. Given that politicians like Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Donald Trump have pegged this shooting epidemic to a broken mental health system, Oliver obliges and examines the issue in depth. But there’s a catch: “The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health,” he argues. “Because, for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people.” The host cites a February 2015 report by the American Journal of Public Health, which states that “fewer than 5 percent of the 120,000 gun-related killings … were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.” Related

						Meet the Beatle: A Guide to Ringo Starr's Solo Career in 20 Songs “In fact, mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators,” he continues. “So the fact we tend to only discuss mental health in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading.” Oliver reports that, “in 2013, an estimated 43.8 million American adults dealt with a mental illness.” And as some presidential hopefuls have observed, our system for helping these people is shattered. In 2009, The Associated Press reported that “nearly 125,000 young and middle-aged adults with serious mental illness lived in U.S. nursing homes” the previous year. Some states have been involved in “Greyhound therapy,” in which patients are discharged too soon and supplied with a one-way bus ticket to another city. According to another depressing report, there are 10 times more people in jail than in state-funded psychiatric centers. “That is terrible,” Oliver says. “Finding out jails are our largest provider of mentally health treatment is like finding out Lil Wayne lyrics are our greatest source of sexual education.” Some police departments have implemented “crisis intervention programs” intended to help direct those with mental health issues into treatment rather than prison. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of police agencies have utilized them. “Our whole system needs a massive overhaul,” Oliver says. But that won’t be easy because of the “clusterfuck” of American agencies devoted to mental health. “We, as a society, have to figure out how to fund [these programs],” he says. “Not just because it makes fiscal sense but because it would save lives. And if I remember rightly, there are some politicians who claim to be pretty motivated to address this problem … If we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control then the very least we owe them is a fucking plan.” In This Article:

http://www.nj.com/education/2015/10/threat_against_nj_and_philadelphia_colleges_what_s.html,"4 tr0216rutgers  murray Rutgers-Camden map in a 2012 file photo. (Ed Murray | The Star-Ledger) Colleges and universities in South Jersey are stepping up police patrols and warning students to stay alert after federal officials notified them of a possible threat against a college near Philadelphia Monday. An anonymous threat was made on an internet site warning someone will ""take up arms against a university near Philadelphia"" at 2 p.m. Monday. The threat was made on 4chan, the same website where a similar warning was posted about violence at an unnamed northwest school in the days before the mass shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College last week. RELATED: Several local colleges in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware said they were notified about the threat by the FBI Sunday. None of the colleges have announced classes are canceled, but several schools alerted students and gave them the option of staying home. What is the threat? The post on 4chan reads: ""On October 5, 2015 at 1:00 PM CT, a fellow robot will take up arms against a university near Philadelphia. His cries will be heard, his victims will cower in fear, and the strength of the Union will decay a little more. If you are in that area, you are encouraged to stay at home and watch the news as the chaos unfolds. His sacrifice will echo throughout the nation."" Who made the threat? The threat was posted by an anonymous user on 4chan, a web bulletin board known for jokes about violence and hoaxes. However, a  similar threat was posted by another user last week referencing violence in the northwest, shortly before the shooting at the community college in Oregon. The threat against the Philadelphia area colleges appears to refer to the Oregon shooter. ""The first of our kind has struck hear into the hearts of America. His cries have been heard, even by the President,"" the post said. Was any college named? No, the threat does not name any specific college or location. Federal authorities have notified colleges and universities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The area is home to dozens of county colleges, four-year colleges, for-profit colleges and technical schools. Are colleges taking this seriously? No colleges have announced they are canceling classes. But several New Jersey schools issued alerts to students. In a notice to Rutgers-Camden students, Chancellor Phoebe Haddon told students to report anything suspicious. She also posted links to Rutgers' plan if an ""active shooter"" in spotted on campus. ""In an abundance of caution, the Rutgers University Police Department is working closely with county, state, and federal agencies, as well as police and security units at other area colleges and universities, to monitor and assess the situation.  On-campus security patrols will be increased throughout the day,"" Haddon said in her message. Can students stay home? At least one university, Rowan University, told students they were permitted to stay home or leave campus if they felt unsafe. ""Our attendance policy allows students to not attend class when they have a reasonable concern for their safety,"" Rowan officials said in a tweet to students.

""So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate,"" he said, ""I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up."" Save these lives and let these people grow up. Yup, I'm happy to think about it. But whose lives was the president asking America to consider and save? Everybody affected by gun violence or just a few folks? Obama lamented how powerless he is without the help of Congress to strengthen gun laws and how ""routine"" mass shootings have become in this country. His speech was impassioned, necessary to help the country grieve, and yet, woefully predictable. It's clear why the president doesn't respond this way to mass shootings such as those perpetrated by gangbangers. It's clear why we all view urban killings as an afterthought, a footnote, the same old same old. What's happening in our cities — such as the uptick this year in murders in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, New Orleans and Baltimore — isn't considered aberrant or extraordinary. No one wants to admit this, but what's worse is that we consider it to be, well, normal. We expect mass shootings in tough neighborhoods in the city. We don't expect them in small towns such as those in Oregon and Connecticut and Colorado. But we've long felt this way. The spray of bullets seems to fit in with the crime and decay in our poor city neighborhoods. Not so much with our idyllic and idealized middle-class communities and small towns. Perhaps our great challenge, even beyond gun control, is to stop viewing street violence as routine and see these young black and brown men who stockpile guns and shoot up their communities as being as mentally deranged and disconnected as their white counterparts who shoot up theirs. One reason it's so difficult to make this connection is that we tend to see young black men as inherently violent and irredeemable. It's hard to acknowledge their physical and mental health; substance abuse problems; their family relationships, or lack thereof; their high incarceration rates and low academic achievement as playing a role in their creation stories. Sean Joe, a professor of social work at Washington University, said the disconnected male between the ages of 15 to about 29 is a challenge no matter his race. Joe began studying self-destructive tendencies after his younger brother, who was a drug dealer, was murdered. ""Whether it's social isolation or structural isolation — such as being disconnected from employment opportunities, training, or family and friends — there's an increased risk for engaging in … violence,"" Joe told me. That violence can be directed toward others or themselves. Joe said a lot of young black men feel angry and alone. They feel that no one cares about them, and they wind up engaging in the world in a way that's corrosive. The president is right to be upset that we're viewing Oregon-like mass shootings as routine. But we're only treating them the same way we've long treated mass shootings in tough neighborhoods. We've come a long way since 1999 when Columbine happened. The massacre at that high school was so extraordinary that it seared itself onto our consciousness, along with the names of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. When 7-year-old Dantrell Davis was killed in 1985, caught in gang crossfire while walking to his Chicago school, that story was so outrageous that it made national news. Now, pop quiz: Can you name the gunmen who shot up the movie theaters in Aurora, Colo., and Lafayette, La.? No? Try this: What are the names of the pregnant mother and grandmother who were killed here just last week? More than our inability to pass stricter gun laws, our memories and lack of motivation — those are the greater dangers. dmturner@tribpub.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/05/the_conservative_evasion_on_guns_128304.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama spoke some of the most important words of his tenure last week in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. ""This is something we should politicize,"" the president said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" This is something we should politicize. His statement was remarkable for violating the etiquette as to what a leader should say after another slaughter by a deranged gunman and the conventional wisdom about how politicians have to pretend that they are not engaged in politics. But Obama was forcing us to face reality. It's politics that has rendered our nation powerless in the face of butchery. There have been at least 142 school shootings since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, and Congress has done nothing. It's politics, as Obama said, that makes the U.S. ""the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,"" and politics that leads our learned legislators to pass laws barring the government from ""even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths."" Imagine: Congress has legislated mandatory ignorance. ""Politicize"" is the right word for another reason: We will not act until politicians start losing elections for opposing even the most modest gun safety measure. We will not act unless political parties that block action lose their majorities. Yes, I am talking about a Republican Party that has completely aligned itself with the interests of gun manufacturers and gun fanatics. I have criticized timid Democrats for doing the NRA's bidding, and they need to be challenged in primaries, even if this means putting some of the party's seats in Congress at risk. But it is the GOP that is institutionally tied to those who insist that gun rights supersede all of our other rights. And I cordially invite House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prove me wrong. Engaging in politics also means unmasking rationalizations that may sound plausible but are merely intended to justify pathetic pandering to the forces of evasion and inertia. The most debilitating dodge is to claim that nothing can be done, that nothing works. The gun lobby specializes in isolating a given incident and declaring sagely that this or that particular solution would not have prevented it. News flash: No law will ever solve every problem or create heaven on Earth. But it is a straight-out lie to assert that stronger gun laws make no difference. Here is the conclusion of a study released in August by National Journal: ""The states that impose the most restrictions on gun users also have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths, while states with fewer regulations typically have a much higher death rate from guns."" State laws could be even more effective if they were matched by federal laws that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands. Politicians who go on about American greatness should be ashamed of saying that the United States is the one and only nation that can't act effectively to solve a problem every other free and democratic country has contained. Conservatives might usefully listen to former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who has noted that he led ""a center-right coalition"" whose parties represented ""virtually every non-urban electoral district in the country."" In other words, his party is a lot like our Republicans. After a psychologically disturbed man killed 35 people in Tasmania, Howard championed state bans on the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons by Australia's states along with a federal ban on their importation. He also sponsored a gun buy-back scheme that got 700,000 guns -- the statistical equivalent of 40 million in the U.S. -- off the streets and destroyed. ""Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control,"" Howard wrote in The New York Times shortly after the Newtown killings. Politicizing this struggle means being unrelentingly candid in calling out an American conservative movement that proudly champions law and order but allows itself to be dominated by gun extremists who deride every gun measure that might make our country a little bit safer -- no matter how many mass killings we have. Conservatives all over the world are aghast at our nation's permissive attitude toward guns. Is a dangerous and harebrained absolutism about weaponry really the issue on which American conservatives want to practice exceptionalism?

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/115549219/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Rieder-Should-the-media-ID-mass-killers/,"It is such a counterintuitive question for a journalist to ask. The job of the journalist is to gather and disseminate information, a vital role in a democracy. The bigger the story, the more important the mission. So the very idea that the news media should not identify mass murderers and should not report exhaustively about them goes totally against the grain. But it is one that appears to be gaining momentum, particularly as information emerges suggesting that publicity about mass killers inspires others to follow their lead. The gunman who last week killed eight of his classmates and wounded nine others at an Oregon community college is believed to have written a blog post expressing his admiration for all the publicity attracted by the former TV journalist who murdered two ex-colleagues in Roanoke in August.  ""On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are,"" the post said. THE NEWS-PRESS Official: Oregon gunman left angry note glorifying mass killers The Roanoke murderer, in turn, wrote to ABC News that he had been inspired to shoot the journalists — on live TV, no less — by the gunman who killed nine worshipers in Charleston in June.  He also expressed approval of previous mass murders at Virginia Tech in 2007 and at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. USA TODAY 'Disturbed' Va. gunman angered by Charleston shootings USA TODAY A reeling Charleston tries to make sense of the senseless Significantly, a study by Arizona State University researchers published in July concluded that mass killings inspire more mass killings.  ""[W]e ... find significant evidence of contagion in mass killings and school shootings,"" they wrote. They added, ""We find significant evidence that mass killings involving firearms are incented by similar events in the immediate past."" The drive for restraint in covering these horrific episodes has been fueled by Caren and Tom Teves, whose son Alex was gunned down in the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. And there are indications their #NoNotoriety crusade is bearing fruit. USA TODAY Voices: Should media withhold names of mass murderers? Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Denver anchorman Kyle Clark are declining to mention the name of the Oregon assassin. Douglas County, Ore., sheriff John Hanlin proclaimed, ""I will not name the shooter,"" and urged the media not to do so, either. As she surveys the media world, Caren Teves sees much less of an in-your-face approach to coverage of the latest outbreak of mass mayhem compared with rampages of the past. ""I'm feeling slightly victorious,"" she told CNN. So if coverage of carnage leads to more carnage, is it time for a news blackout? Not at all. There are important reasons why these hideous episodes need to be covered, and why the perpetrators need to be named. First of all, it's reality, and you can't pretend it didn't happen. It's important to know who carried out the dastardly deed. By examining the person's background, news organizations can spotlight motivation and perhaps uncover missed opportunities that might have prevented the bloodshed. Reporting can reveal patterns that are important to public-policy debates over gun laws, mental illness and other issues. But that doesn't mean wallowing. #NoNotoriety is making important points. While coverage — and, yes, identifying the culprit — are necessary, it should be coverage with care. It's important not to seem to be glorifying the killer. Too often the criminal gets far more attention than the victims. Once the name of the killer is out there, it doesn't have to be repeated over and over again. There's no need to showcase huge images of murderers. And no reason to publish their entire ""manifestos,"" which is often exactly what they want. The challenge is toughest for cable news, which has 24 hours to fill each day and by nature focuses heavily, if not obsessively, on the huge story of the moment. Even Tom Teves says he has no problem with the killer being ID'd at some point. Just don't do it over and over and over again. I asked Brent Jones, USA TODAY's standards editor, for his take on how to balance the objectives of informing the public and refusing to play into the hands of psychopaths. ""I think we have a journalistic mandate to explore the background, including mind-set, of a mass murderer in our quest for truth, specifically in seeking answers that might lead to understanding why a heinous crime was committed,"" he replied. ""Such insight can also lead to future safety measures. While we may be able to point to examples where news coverage likely contributed to copycat crimes, I don’t think it would be responsible for us to conclude ahead of the reporting process that every mass murderer’s motive was glory and fame."" But he thinks it's important to tread lightly: ""Events under such circumstances have shaped an important national discussion about finding a balance between sharing loads of click-bait information, some of which may prove harmful to the public, vs. sharing information strictly in the interest of the public’s need to know."" That's a discussion that needs to continue. Mass murders have become so shockingly commonplace in the U.S. that it's not shocking at all when they occur. And so news outlets, tragically, may well be put to the test again soon. Mass murders need to be covered, but in a way that sheds light rather than seems to turn deranged killers into notorious anti-heroes."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/10/05/oregon-hospital-shooting-pizza-louisiana_n_8247390.html,"Associate Editor for Good News at The Huffington Post. A simple gesture brought a moment of comfort to a hospital staff dealing with tragedy. While caring for victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon on Thursday, the staff of Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg received an unexpected delivery -- pizzas sent by Lafayette General Medical Center in Louisiana, USA Today reported. The delivery was an act of solidarity, as the Louisiana hospital had been the recipient of a similar gesture while treating its own shooting victims in July. ""We just wanted to pay it forward,” LGMC spokesman Daryl Cetnar told the news outlet. “We received pizza from a hospital in Waco, Texas, after the shootings here, and we were in awe of the gesture. We were hoping to never have to pay it forward.” Sadly, the copycat act of kindness comes after terrible instances of history repeating itself. Back in May, Baylor Scott & White Medical Center treated dozens of injured people after gunfire erupted between rival biker gangs in Waco, killing nine. Two months later, LGMC treated victims following a mass shooting at a Lafayette movie theater, and staff at the Texas hospital, knowing the chaos that comes with such a mass response, had eight pies delivered to LGMC, New York Daily News reported. “People were speechless,” Cetnar told the news outlet at the time. “They were all like, ‘How did somebody think of this so quickly?’ What’s most impressive is that they paid it forward almost instantaneously.” And on Thursday, the Louisiana hosptial paid it forward to Roseburg, Oregon, after the mass shooting on the college campus left 10 reported dead. A nurse from Mercy Medical Center told USA Today the ER has also received comfort and support from other hospitals around the country. “They remind us they got through it,” she said. “We are not alone, and we can recover like they have.” Also on HuffPost: Associate Editor for Good News at The Huffington Post."

McAfee, writing in a column for the International Business Times, stated that an EMP (eletromagnetic propulsion) attack on the U.S. should be a far bigger concern. In the wake of last week's tragic mass shooting in Oregon, President Obama said in his speech on October 2, ""Here's what you need to do: You have to make sure that anybody that you are voting for is on the right side of this issue."" That ""issue"" being gun control, the President went on to say that even if a candidate is ""great on other stuff, you've got to vote against them,"" if they're not for gun control. According to John McAfee, who recently announced himself a candidate in the 2016 presidential race, President Obama's sole focus on gun control is misguided but it did raise the question for McAfee of whether or not there is any other single topic that merits such a ""single issue status.""  ""Our leaders are nearly all ill prepared for this near certain, not-too-distant (EMP attack) event,"" writes John McAfee. ""If I were forced to choose a single issue, this would obviously be the issue.""   The Daily Mail reports that John McAfee was at first baffled by President Obama's assertion that gun control should be the top concern of all Americans, but again, it also raised new questions for McAfee.  If we are going to let just one issue dictate who should be elected, asks McAfee, shouldn't it be the issue that addresses the potential deaths of most of America's citizens? I.e EMP attacks? ""... surely weighing the possible deaths of 90% of our citizens due to cyber warfare against gun violence which causes fewer deaths per year than traffic accidents, seems that possibly our president is suffering an acid flashback rather than myself,"" concludes McAfee. But, are EMP - electromagnetic propulsion - attacks really an immediate threat that could send the U.S. and its people into a death spiral? In their May issue, VICE interviewed a military and global intelligence expert about the dangers of EMP attacks, and while the expert agreed that EMP attacks were technically possible, they'd also be prohibitively expensive and most likely would only be an added result of nuclear strikes. ""It's not that EMPs are not a threat,"" the expert told VICE, ""It's just that—although the effect would be massive—currently they're not really a risk apart from nuclear strikes, so highlighting them as the greatest threat there is might not be entirely realistic.""   At the same time, John McAfee is a recognized expert in several areas himself, so recognizing the dangers of an EMP attack, particularly if it would kill 90% of Americans in the two years that followed, might be a problem politicians should consider along with gun control.

Students were welcomed back by grief counselors and comfort dogs after a mass shooting shook the community to its core last Thursday. The campus reopened to let students and staff retrieve their vehicles and other belongings, and to help restore a sense of normalcy before classes were set to resume next Monday, school officials said. A mobile command post of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department remained in the parking lot, and a portion of an outdoor amphitheater on campus had been transformed into a shrine decorated with a banner displaying the message, “UCC Strong/We will prevail,” as well as flowers, candles, balloons and the names of the innocent lives taken Thursday. Snyder Hall, where the shooting unfolded, was still partially hidden behind a a barrier of chain-link fencing and black tarp. “The anxiety of walking back on campus is very real,"" student Jared Norman said in a text message to Reuters, adding that his visit to the campus ""begins the road to recovery.""

He reportedly ordered individuals to stand, asked them their religion and then started shooting them. ""He asked them, 'Are you Christian?

The tweeted picture, now deleted, showed Roker and his two-person camera crew, clad in rain gear, smiling widely as they prepared to ""report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina"" for NBC's Nightly News. Behind them, a small green-yellow car lay on its side in a shallow hole left by the collapse of the side of a road. Roker later said the woman who was driving that car got out safely.  But the explanation came too late; outraged tweets soon appeared: This selfie disgusts me.

In 2014, he apologized for tweeting a ""low-blow"" slam at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for not closing the schools before a major snow storm, forecasting he'd be a ""one-term"" mayor. It didn't help that he misspelled the mayor's name. I knew this am @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCSchools would close schools. Talk about a bad prediction. Long range DiBlasio forecast: 1 term ""I will say, the one tweet I do regret in the heat — I'm very passionate about the weather,"" he said later on Today.

http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/The-conservative-evasion-on-guns-6549613.php,"President Obama spoke some of the most important words of his tenure last week in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. “This is something we should politicize,” the president said. “It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” This is something we should politicize. His statement was remarkable for violating the etiquette as to what a leader should say after another slaughter by a deranged gunman and the conventional wisdom about how politicians have to pretend that they are not engaged in politics. But Obama was forcing us to face reality. It’s politics that has rendered our nation powerless in the face of butchery. There have been at least 142 school shootings since the massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, and Congress has done nothing. It’s politics, as Obama said, that makes the U.S. “the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,” and politics that leads our learned legislators to pass laws barring the government from “even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.” Imagine: Congress has legislated mandatory ignorance. “Politicize” is the right word for another reason: We will not act until politicians start losing elections for opposing even the most modest gun safety measure. We will not act unless political parties that block action lose their majorities. Yes, I am talking about a Republican Party that has completely aligned itself with the interests of gun manufacturers and gun fanatics. I have criticized timid Democrats for doing the NRA’s bidding, and they need to be challenged in primaries, even if this means putting some of the party’s seats in Congress at risk. But it is the GOP that is institutionally tied to those who insist that gun rights supersede all of our other rights. And I cordially invite House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prove me wrong. Engaging in politics also means unmasking rationalizations that may sound plausible but are merely intended to justify pathetic pandering to the forces of evasion and inertia. The most debilitating dodge is to claim that nothing can be done, that nothing works. The gun lobby specializes in isolating a given incident and declaring sagely that this or that particular solution would not have prevented it. News flash: No law will ever solve every problem or create heaven on Earth. But it is a straight-out lie to assert that stronger gun laws make no difference. Here is the conclusion of a study released in August by National Journal: “The states that impose the most restrictions on gun users also have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths, while states with fewer regulations typically have a much higher death rate from guns.” State laws could be even more effective if they were matched by federal laws that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands. Politicians who go on about American greatness should be ashamed of saying that the United States is the one and only nation that can’t act effectively to solve a problem every other free and democratic country has contained. Politicizing this struggle means being unrelentingly candid in calling out an American conservative movement that proudly champions law and order but allows itself to be dominated by gun extremists who deride every gun measure that might make our country a little bit safer — no matter how many mass killings we have. Conservatives all over the world are aghast at our nation’s permissive attitude toward guns. Is a dangerous and harebrained absolutism about weaponry really the issue on which American conservatives want to practice exceptionalism? © 2015 Washington Post Writers Group E-mail: ejdionne@washpost.com Twitter: @EJDionne E.J.

Loading... October 5, 2015 Students were welcomed back on Monday by grief counselors and comfort dogs to the small Oregon community college shattered by a shooting rampage that left 10 people dead, though classes were to remain canceled through the week. The campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles (300 km) south of Portland, was reopened to registered students and staff four days after the massacre, allowing them to retrieve vehicles and other belongings left behind in Thursday's pandemonium. The reopening also was aimed at helping restore a sense of normalcy on campus before classes and other activities at the college of some 3,000 full-time students were due to resume next Monday, school officials said. While the bucolic college, situated on a bend in the North Umpqua River, appeared peaceful as staff and students milled about, an atmosphere of trepidation prevailed among some of those returning on Monday. ""The anxiety of walking back on campus is very real,"" student Jared Norman said in a text message to Reuters, adding that his campus visit ""begins the road to recovery."" He and other students met with the college student-life director on Sunday night in preparation for their return. Students were greeted by teams of volunteers with six golden retrievers from the national K-9 Comfort Dogs network run by Lutheran Church Charities. The group has worked at the scenes of various recent tragedies, including the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot to death by a gunman in December 2012, said Richard Martin, a volunteer from Northbrook, Illinois. The college bookstore also was reopened, and an outdoor amphitheater on campus was set up with tables adorned with bouquets of flowers flanked by wreaths on stands, one with the message: ""We Will Always Remember."" Law enforcement was not readily visible in the center of campus, but a mobile command post of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department remained set up in the parking lot. A permanent billboard along the main road leading onto campus greeted returning faculty with the message: ""Welcome back staff"" in black capital letters. The sunny, quiet tranquility stood in stark contrast to the fear that gripped the campus last Thursday in the midst of the deadliest U.S. mass shooting in two years and the bloodiest in Oregon's modern history. A gunman, later identified as Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, stormed into his writing class in Snyder Hall, shot the professor at point-blank range and began picking off cowering classmates one at a time as he questioned them their religion, according to survivors' accounts. The assailant ultimately died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging shots with police officers who arrived on the scene to confront him. Besides the English professor and eight students slain in the rampage, nine other people were wounded, three of them critically. Parents of two survivors revealed over the weekend that the gunman had handed an envelope to one of the male students in the class, whose life the suspect deliberately spared. CNN reported on Sunday that the envelope contained a computer flash drive that the surviving student turned over to authorities immediately afterward. Authorities said Harper-Mercer, who moved from the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, California, to Oregon with his mother in 2013, carried six guns, five magazines of bullets and body armor with him to campus the day of the killings. Another eight firearms and a stockpile of ammo were recovered from the apartment he and his mother shared a short distance from the college, officials said. Authorities have revealed little of what they may know about Harper-Mercer's motives. The FBI and local sheriff have declined to comment on media reports that he left behind racist writings. People who knew him casually have described Harper-Mercer as a withdrawn, socially awkward loner. After a brief, failed stint in the U.S. Army that ended with an administrative discharge, he graduated from a nonprofit school in Torrance that catered to students with learning and emotional disabilities. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. He was by all accounts preoccupied with guns, a passion he was reported to have shared with his mother, who spent time with her son at target ranges. The head of a private firearms academy in Torrance has said Harper-Mercer sought to register for classes there in 2012 or 2013 but was turned away because he was found to be ""weird"" and overly eager for high-level weapons training at his age.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/ZJGQKZ2VMe8/shot-to-death-before-she-was-old-enough-to-be-shot-at-school.html,"SEARCH Guns are such a scourge that a 5-month-old Cleveland girl was hit by a stray bullet just a day after nine people were cut down in Oregon. Special Correspondent Not yet halfway to her first birthday, Aavielle Nevaeh Wakefield was too young to be the victim of a school shooting. But on the same day as the massacre at Umpqua Community College, little Aavielle proved that no age is too young to be fatally wounded by a stray bullet in America. “Somebody was shooting at our car as we came through a street,” reported a caller to 911 in Cleveland. “And they shot the baby. The baby dead!” “How old is the child?” the dispatcher asked. “The baby is only 5 months old,” the caller said. “Five months old… Male or female?” the dispatcher asked. “Beg your pardon?” “Male or female? Is it a boy or girl?” “Female! Female!” “Is she awake?” “No!” “Is she breathing?” “No!” Screaming could be heard in the background. “That’s her mother holding her,” the caller explained. Moments before, the mother had been driving the family car back from grocery shopping when gunfire erupted. A bullet had torn through one of the car’s doors and the baby seat, and now Iesha Wakefield was clutching her bleeding infant daughter to her. The caller was apparently the grandmother. “What part of her body was she shot?” the dispatcher asked. “We don’t know,” the caller answered. “Her mother won’t let her loose.” “OK. Get a clean, dry cloth or towel. You need put it on the wound, apply firm and steady pressure and don’t lift it up to look.” The screaming continued. Aavielle’s 8-year-old sister had also been in the car, and she was hearing and seeing it all. “Ma’am, listen to me,” the dispatcher continued. “We have to give the baby mouth-to-mouth, OK? You need to get her flat on her back…” The screaming heightened in pitch and desperation as the caller tried to get Aavielle from her mother. “Ma’am, do you have the baby?… OK, ma’am, listen, do you have the baby?” The caller apparently succeeded. “She was shot right under her right arm,” the caller reported. “There’s a hole in her shirt.” “Get the baby flat on her back, nothing underneath her. We need to start mouth-to-mouth.” “Blood is coming out of her nose.” “We need to start mouth-to-mouth. Clean out her mouth. Ma’am? Hello?” “I’m here. I’m here. I’m trying to do what you say.” “With her head tilted straight back, you need to completely cover her nose and mouth with your mouth. Blow two puffs of air into the lungs, one second each, just enough to make her chest rise with each breath. Do that now.” “OK, that’s what I’m trying to do. My mouth over her mouth and nose. What do I do then?” “Blow two puffs of air one second each. Do you feel the air going in and out? Do you see the chest rising when you do it? Ma’am?” Paramedics arrived. An ambulance rushed Aavielle to Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital. But the bullet had done what bullets are designed to do, just as the bullets had in the mass shooting in Oregon that had the country stunned and President Obama outraged. In Cleveland, Police Chief Calvin Williams was left in tears by little Aavielle’s death. “Enough is enough,” Williams said at a press conference. “When are we going to stop counting babies killed out there?” But the rest of the country would not likely have paid much attention even if we had not been focused on the killing of nine at Umpqua. Two other children, ages 3 and 5, had been killed in Cleveland during the previous month and the nation had not even shrugged. No wonder a monster such as the gunman in Oregon felt he needed to kill as many people as possible to get the attention he craved. And there is nothing new about this indifference when even young children are shot to death one or two at a time. No uproar had ensued after a study by the Children’s Defense Fund found that in 2007 more preschoolers than police officers were shot to death. Number of preschoolers killed by guns: 87 Number of police officers killed by guns: 68 Among the school-age kids this year was 9-year-old Jamyla Bolden. She was killed in August by a stray round as she sat doing her homework on her mother’s bed in Ferguson, a block from where protests had erupted after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a cop. No demonstrations, no national debate followed Jamyla’s death. The kiddie carnage continued. This past September, a 2-year-old was shot in the face in Memphis and a 5-year-old was killed by a stray round in Kansas City, as was a 7-year-old at a birthday party in Charlotte. A 10-year-old was shot in Milwaukee, where 11 children were shot last year. And now we have a dead 5-month-old. “A baby baby?” the 911 dispatcher asked when first told. “A baby,” the caller confirmed. As of Monday afternoon, the police reported no arrests in the shooting despite having offered a $25,000 reward for information. The funeral for Aavielle Nevaeh Wakefield will be held on Thursday morning at Mount Zion Church of Oakwood Village. Obama is not expected to attend. Aavielle’s family notes that her middle name is “Heaven” spelled backward. She no doubt would have delighted in such word magic had she lived to learn her ABCs. She leaves us a country that barely seemed to notice when yet another child was shot to death before she was old enough to die in a school shooting."
http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/NKC2NW3s1Cs/," John Oliver, host of Last Week Tonight, took a different approach to discussing the Oregon shooting. Oliver noted that often mass shootings are followed by a mental health discussion, specifically, speculation as to whether or not the shooter was or is mentally ill. According to John, as quoted by USA Today, the aftermath of tragedies like Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon is probably the worst time to hold such discussions.   John Oliver notes that Americans are extremely uncomfortable discussing mental illness, despite the fact that an ""estimated 43.8 million American adults"" are coping with mental health issues. He said that unfortunately, this topic is most likely to be discussed after a shooting like the one in Oregon, and often as a red herring: The topic that should be discussed at such times is gun control. Said Oliver, ""It seems there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health."" He particularly noted that Republican candidates were the ones pushing the blame for the Oregon shooting and other mass shootings on mental illness while actively denying the importance of gun control in the United States. Their arguments are countered by a rather powerful observation by John.   ""Mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators.""  ""Mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators.""  Considering the fact that such persons are more likely to be victims of shootings than perpetrators, it's rather distasteful that Americans continue to treat those with mental health issues as ""ticking time bombs"" and inevitable dangers to society. It's also important to note that members of the public are quick to speculate about the mental state of someone behind a shooting, but there's no actual proof that such persons are mentally ill.

According to John, severe mental illness affects nearly 10 million Americans, but the current treatment system is ""ineffective, expensive, and dangerous."" Much of the burden for these services are provided by ill-equipped nursing homes, prisons, and apparently ""Greyhound buses."" Tragically, in America, mental health is something more commonly known, as John Oliver quipped, as ""a great way to win an Oscar."" The public admires someone who pretends to be insane but has no time or compassion to push for real solutions. Oddly enough, not even in the wake of mass shootings. Like gun control, apparently this important topic is something to be kicked around but otherwise largely ignored. John Oliver said of this behavior that ""if we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a plan.""

Democratic candidates for president have directly attacked the issue of gun control in the wake of the Oregon shooting. Perhaps they too can offer plans to aid in advancing America's mental health system. What do you think of what John Oliver had to say about mental health discussions following the Oregon shooting?

Roker has since apologized for the insensitive selfie after a firestorm of anger erupted on Twitter. Al has also deleted the tweet and noted that the woman in the stranded car is okay, Page Six reported. Al Roker tweeted the ""flood selfie"" with NBC colleagues, all three wearing slickers and grinning before the grim scene, including a collapsed highway. Al's photo came with this message, ""My crew and I getting ready to report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina on @NBCNightlyNews with Kate Snow.""    ""It's def not ppl being too touchy. Grinning in front of a destroyed road while in an area where ppl are losing lives and homes is incredibly inappropriate. If u can't understand why then u are extremely out of touch,"" she tweeted. As USA Today noted, newscasters know better than to grin broadly while reporting serious news -- a mass shooting, for instance -- but apparently this common sense etiquette hasn't yet translated into the modern-day habit of taking selfies to mark every occasion. And Al Roker has rubbed people the wrong way on social media before. In 2014, he criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (while spelling his name wrong) for not closing schools before a snow storm, predicting that he'd be a one-term mayor. Roker apologized for that comment, too.  All told, two feet of rain has fallen. Columbia resident James Shirer told CBS News he's never seen anything like this historic flood.   In Columbia, flood victims at Willow Creek Apartments were evacuated by rescue crews on boats, returning Monday to find TVs, jewelry, and other valuables stolen. Resident Juamaame Evins was among those robbed, but he was keeping a positive attitude.   In perhaps the most dramatic and heartbreaking story to come out of the flood, Pastor Wayne Reeves was giving an interview when two caskets popped out of the ground and started to be carried away by the waters -- a husband and wife. Reeves swam into waist-deep water after the caskets as the deceased's family looked on.  Meanwhile, the government is faced with billions of dollars in rebuilding costs and this sobering truth: rivers may not crest for another two weeks and more rain is forecast. ""I believe that things will get worse before they get better,"" Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said. In other words, that's not the time or the place for a selfie, Al Roker.

https://www.nationalreview.com/murphy-helping-families-in-mental-health-crisis-act-good-legislation,"Follow Us National Review Clarence Thomas’s Monumental Legacy Do We Have Freedom of Speech, Really? The Kind Soul of Clarence Thomas The Two Countercultures Clarence Thomas, an American Justice In the wake of yet another tragic mass shooting, gun controllers have been quick to proffer a catalogue of measures, none of which would have stopped last week’s shooting at Umpqua Community College — nor the murders in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, nor those in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Yet many of those same gun controllers reject as a distraction mental-health-care reforms that could help prevent mass shootings committed by psychotics — and also assist the several million persons whose everyday lives are burdened by schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other serious mental illnesses. One such proposal is available to Congress right now: Republican representative Tim Murphy’s Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (HR 2646). Representative Murphy, a Pennsylvania psychologist, has garnered broad, bipartisan support for his bill, which would do much to overhaul our ineffective, oft-corrupt mental-health bureaucracy. The federal government spends $130 billion annually on mental health — to little effect. This is primarily because the federal government’s mental-health policy is largely driven by the failed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The most important part of Murphy’s bill is to eliminate SAMHSA and replace it with an assistant secretary for Mental Health, charged with shifting federal dollars away from useless, often duplicative programs and those that focus on “behavioral wellness” and mild forms of mental illness and toward those that focus on the most seriously ill. One such program is assisted outpatient treatment, which has proven effective in reducing rates of violence, drug and alcohol abuse, incarceration, and repeated hospitalization among the seriously mentally ill. By reducing the use of expensive hospitalization and incarceration, these programs will provide significant savings to the state and federal criminal-justice and health-care systems, while providing families a way to admit dangerously ill kin into psychiatric care without abrogating patients’ legal protections. EDITORIAL: Congress Is Waking Up on Mental Health Murphy’s bill will also modestly modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act so that family members of people with serious mental illness can finally be involved in the care of their loved ones. The astonishing reach of medical privacy laws — many of which were developed to serve the interests of insurance, rather than health-care providers — will be pruned back to allow family members to know what medications their loved ones have been prescribed, when they are scheduled to see their doctors, and other crucial information when it is needed to protect health, safety, and welfare. The bill upholds HIPAA’s privacy protections — for example, notes from psychotherapy will not be available — while recognizing that patients whose families are involved in treatment normally have better long-term outcomes, and that current privacy strictures put families in untenable, even dangerous situations. Also, giving families access to necessary patient information is another way of helping to temper the influence of SAMHSA-promoted “patient advocates,” whose activities nowadays often hamper, rather than promote, access to effective treatment for the most seriously ill. The Murphy bill will amend the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Program, passed by Congress in 1986, to restore it to its original intent: protecting patients from abuse and neglect. #share#And the bill will do much more, including increasing access to tele-psychiatry for mental-health patients in underserved areas, advancing early invention programs with proven track records, and extending health IT laws to help mental-health providers and primary-care physicians better coordinate. The bill is unnecessarily stalled in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Representative Fred Upton (R., Mich.), known for being conflict-averse, should not shy away from this fight. Every candidate for House leadership has signaled support for Murphy’s bill, 130 representatives from both parties have signed on as cosponsors, and the legislation has widespread grassroots support from the American Psychiatric Association, Mental Illness Policy Org., the National Sheriff’s Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and a host of others. Backers have even designated Wednesday, October 7, “National Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Day,” and plan to bombard Representative Upton’s office with calls and social-media messages (#HR2646). The congressman should listen to them. RELATED: Fixing America’s Mental-Health System Compared with the range of milder mental illnesses toward which our mental-health efforts have long been focused, serious mental illnesses directly affect a relatively small number of Americans — less than 5 percent of the total population. But the consequences are evident in our prisons and on our streets — as well as in those instances when untreated serious mental illness expresses itself in mass violence. There is no panacea to these problems, but the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act is a strong step in the right direction.

http://feeds.ew.com/~r/entertainmentweekly/latest-blog-news/~3/P78XTpYbKiA/seth-meyers-oregon-shooting,"Tackling the “hopelessness” of the gun-control debate in American politics, Seth Meyers dinged Republican presidential candidate hopefuls Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, and Donald Trump for their response to the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week. “All the data shows that the more guns you have, the more gun deaths you have,” Meyers said on Monday’s episode of The Late Show. He then showed a chart on the relationship between the rates of gun deaths and gun ownership among developed nations. “We’re so far away from every other country, we’re running out of chart.” The segment also touched on Bush’s remarks in the immediate aftermath of the Roseburg, Oregon shooting, which left nine people dead. The former Florida governor was asked about gun control in the wake of the shooting, and responded, “I had this challenge as governor. Look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” “To be clear, he wasn’t callously shrugging off the shooting, he was saying that when tragedies like this occur, it’s important to not do anything,” Meyers joked.

Lovato, 23, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19, has been on Capitol Hill since Wednesday speaking with lawmakers about mental health disorders on behalf of the ""Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Illness"" initiative.

While speaking with MSNBC's Tamron Hall Monday, the singer said that despite mental health being primarily discussed after such tragedies as last week's mass shooting in Umpqua, Ore., those with mental illnesses are rarely the ones to hurt others.
""Unfortunately, we've had several instances where mental health has been brought to the attention by the media because of these tragedies,"" Lovato said. ""I think it's really important to remember that actually...people with mental illness are... more likely to inflict harm on themselves and become the victim rather than be the perpetrators.""
The mental health initiative is backed by organizations such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the Jed Foundation, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals.
This is the first initiative supported by all five organizations at once, the website explains.

The former Disney star and ""Cool For the Summer"" singer believes vocalizing one's mental struggles is important to help people find treatment sooner. ""I think that the more that you're vocal for yourself, and for others, the more that people can help you,"" she explained. ""That's why it's so important that you speak up.""

Sean Paul, Sia reunite for new song 'Dynamite'
 Oct. 22 (UPI) -- Jamaican singer and rapper Sean Paul released ""Dynamite,"" an upbeat club anthem featuring Sia. WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (UPI) -- Singer and actress Demi Lovato is serious about mental health. Lovato, 23, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19, has been on Capitol Hill since Wednesday speaking with lawmakers about mental health disorders on behalf of the ""Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Illness"" initiative.
Advertisement While speaking with MSNBC's Tamron Hall Monday, the singer said that despite mental health being primarily discussed after such tragedies as last week's mass shooting in Umpqua, Ore., those with mental illnesses are rarely the ones to hurt others. ""Unfortunately, we've had several instances where mental health has been brought to the attention by the media because of these tragedies,"" Lovato said. ""I think it's really important to remember that actually...people with mental illness are... more likely to inflict harm on themselves and become the victim rather than be the perpetrators."" The mental health initiative is backed by organizations such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the Jed Foundation, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals. This is the first initiative supported by all five organizations at once, the website explains.
Advertisement The former Disney star and ""Cool For the Summer"" singer believes vocalizing one's mental struggles is important to help people find treatment sooner. ""I think that the more that you're vocal for yourself, and for others, the more that people can help you,"" she explained. ""That's why it's so important that you speak up."""

The reports of a gunman at a Philadelphia college come just days after a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killing nine people plus himself, and injuring several others. The attack renewed debate about gun control in the U.S. and safety on college campuses. The Community College of Philadelphia has been locked down for gun violence before. In 2014, the school was locked down after a student pulled a gun on another student in class. No shots were fired and no one was injured. This is a breaking news story. More information about the Community College of Philadelphia gunman story will be provided as it becomes available. Update [12:47 P.M. Eastern Time]: As The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports, Philadelphia police have arrested a 17-year-old boy in connection with the Community College of Philadelphia lockdown. Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey has told news reporters that a 17-year-old boy was arrested. Police say he pulled a gun on a fellow student in a dispute with another student. Ramsey describes the people involved as ""two individuals with a history.""

http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/10/theater_review_encore_theatres_5.html,"Screen Shot 2015-10-09 at 11.36.40 AM.png Adam Woolsey and Mahalia Greenway in ""Bonnie and Clyde: A New Musical,"" now playing at Dexter's Encore Theatre. (Photo by Michele Anliker) Like most works of art, stage musicals will mean different things to you in different moments of your life. Last year, when director Ron Baumanis resurrected the short-lived Broadway musical ""Bonnie and Clyde"" by way of an Ann Arbor Civic Theatre production at Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre, I was enthralled by the naked intimacy of Clyde serenading his partner-in-crime with a ukulele while sitting in a bathtub. Now, as a brand new Baumanis-directed production of ""Bonnie"" takes the stage at Dexter's Encore Theatre, my heart stopped twice: when Bonnie's mother, played by Emily Rogers, desperately, fruitlessly pleads with Bonnie to leave Clyde and his life of crime; and when Bonnie, played by Mahalia Greenway, explains why she's not scared of the fatal path she's chosen in ""Dyin' Ain't So Bad."" Hints of Greek tragedy peek through ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in these crucial, turning point moments. Yet like ""Titanic,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde"" hardly suffers from a spoiler alert problem. Based on real-life, depression era crime duo Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and the pair's violent end, is a known commodity - even among those who have never seen director Arthur Penn's controversial 1967 movie version of the story, starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. So ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is inevitably about the journey, not the destination. The musical - with a book by Ivan Menchell, music by Frank Wildhorn, and lyrics by Don Black - begins by giving us glimpses of Bonnie's and Clyde's childhoods. Young Bonnie (Kylie Scarpace) must leave her Texas hometown with her mother (Rogers) after her father's death, and she entertains an escapist fantasy about becoming a movie star; and Young Clyde (Ben Chambers) is part of a family barely making it through the depression, so he regularly gets in trouble with the law and dreams about being Al Capone or Billy the Kid. As young adults, Clyde (Adam Woolsey) breaks out of jail and offers to help Bonnie (Greenway), a waitress whose car has died at the side of the road. Their powerful attraction to each other is mirrored by a marriage between Clyde's brother and fellow jail-escapee Buck (Peter Crist) and hairdresser Blanche (Elizabeth Jaffe). God-fearing Blanche convinces Buck to turn himself in to serve the rest of his sentence, but Clyde is snared against his will, and once he's back in prison, he faces brutal physical and sexual abuse. Bonnie helps him escape, and though the two start out only intending to commit robberies, they soon launch into a no-holds-barred, multi-state crime spree that makes them the object of an aggressive police manhunt. As with any tale that's focused on murderous criminals, you inevitably feel a slow burn of discomfort - particularly in the wake of yet another mass shooting - as you come to relate and sympathize with Bonnie and Clyde's self-inflicted predicament. There are, of course, moments when each could choose a different path, but these are people largely shaped by their circumstances (the unrelenting depression; the soul-shattering rape that fuels Clyde to ""Raise a Little Hell""; Bonnie's first reflex to run when Clyde starts killing, before she realizes that for her, it's ""Too Late to Turn Back Now""). Yes, we almost always have another choice; you don't usually have to choose crime and violence. But this tale, as it's told, helps us at least comprehend Bonnie and Clyde's foolhardy arc toward their own destruction. And as Brodie Brockie's projections of photographs of the real Bonnie and Clyde (and Buck and Blanche) remind us, repeatedly, the story is based in an all-too-true reality. Crist does strong work as Buck, who struggles to choose between the wife he loves, who wants him to live a law-abiding, but economically hard, life; and the brother he loves, who promises a life of excitement, wealth and fame. Jaffe is a good match for Crist, particularly when she's selling the positives of an ordinary life in ""That's What You Call a Dream."" Woolsey, meanwhile, is like a walking, unlit firecracker, human but ready to explode at all times. But Greenway is ""Bonnie and Clyde""'s biggest ""wow"" factor. (There's a reason she's won a Wilde Award the past two years in a row, folks.) From the slow dance slinkiness of ""How 'Bout a Dance,"" to the defiant ""This World Will Remember Us"" (with Woolsey), to the heartwrenching ""Dyin' Ain't So Bad"" (which had me in tears), Greenway nails it all, so that you feel just as desperate as Bonnie's mother to stop this young woman from so ardently pursuing her own destruction. Baumanis' Encore production, which runs just short of two and a half hours, inevitably feels a bit more claustrophobic, staging-wise, in the black-box space. But Tyler Driskill's music direction (and five piece orchestra) remains outstanding, and Matthew Brennan's choreography makes good use of Daniel C. Walker's colorless, tri-level set. Walker's lighting design - particularly in moments of ""no turning back"" decisions - complements the actions in subtle, effective ways. And Sharon Larkey Urick's costumes evoke the economically depressed era well, while also making Bonnie a stylish, more colorful standout. There's a lot to talk about in regard to this show, and this particular moment in our collective history. I couldn't help but think about how, in the wake of violence, we consistently end up fascinated by, and talking exhaustively about, the criminals instead of the victims. There's something in us that always wants to know the unknowable. So if you caught ""Bonnie and Clyde"" last fall, here's a chance to see a slightly different take on it and dig deeper into its questions. If the show is new to you, you may feel a bit unnerved, but you'll also likely feel an electric spark of discovery. Jenn McKee is an entertainment reporter for The Ann Arbor News.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/06/shoot_first_ask_questions_later_128317.html,"After America learned of the latest mass shooting at an Oregon community college, President Barack Obama delivered remarks in which he lamented the loss of good, innocent people and then added: ""Somehow this has become routine. ... We've become numb to this."" By the next day, Obama had a remedy: ""Be a single-issue voter."" If you want to stop mass shootings, Obama argued, don't vote for candidates who oppose federal background checks and ""gun safety laws."" Nine adults who should be alive today are not, while the 26-year-old shooter got what he wanted -- to leave this earth in what he perceived as a blaze of glory. It is revolting to think how easy it is for some unhappy loser to leave a swath of destruction because he cannot make a life for himself in this world. The problem with guns is simple: Any idiot can kill others with them. Obama and other Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein would have you believe that they have an easy answer to this problem. Obama talked up proposed background checks as a remedy when he should have known the checks would have made no difference; the Oregon shooter had no criminal record, no restraining order against him, no involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The New York Times reported that the shooter brought five handguns and a rifle with him to Umpqua Community College -- but left seven firearms at home. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman said the shooter and his family had 14 firearms in total -- all purchased legally from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Feinstein sent out a statement: ""After each shooting, I've been hopeful that Congress would act to close the gun show loophole, mandate universal background checks and remove high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons from our streets."" Last week, National Review's Charles C.W. Cooke asked the hosts and other guests on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" which specific proposals they believe could prevent another Roseburg. ""This is not a competition to see who is the most vexed,"" Cooke maintained, adding it is -- or at least it is supposed to be -- a public policy debate. Cooke was wrong; it is a contest about which side looks angrier. Co-host Mika Brzezinski jumped all over Cooke for not wanting to do more. Mark Halperin, co-managing editor of Bloomberg Politics, said, ""We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity and talk about how the other side's ideas aren't any good."" They offered no concrete ideas. In the gun debate, you often see people who would never buy a gun saying they support reasonable rules such as background checks, when what they really want to do is stop others from owning guns. The shooter's father on CNN said he wants Congress to pass ""gun control"" laws. He also said, ""I'm a great believer: You don't buy guns. Don't buy guns."" That's the sort of talk that prompts gun enthusiasts to buy more guns before Washington bans them. Ditto the Feinstein statement. So the question I would ask is: Is the idea to pass a law that makes supporters feel good, or is it to prevent violence against innocents? Or is it about turning people into single-issue voters?

This one was at an Oregon junior college. It  happens to be the 142nd school shooting since Sandy Hook (see:everytown.org/article/schoolshootings/ for the entire list), and no mainstream journalist is asking (or, if he knows, his editors are not allowing him to reveal the answer to) the pertinent question that people who truly want to understand the epidemic need to know: ""What brain-damaging, addictive psych drug(s) was this brain-altered shooter taking or withdrawing from?""  There is an immense amount of evidence that legally prescribed psychiatric drugs are major contributors to acts of violence. This evidence has been gathered (and even published [in peer reviewed journals and alternative media outlets that don't take advertising revenue from Big Pharma]) by a number of science writers, pharmaceutical industry whistle-blowers, courageous neuroscientists, good investigative journalists and a multitude of silenced psychiatric drug survivors. The range of acts of violence by Drug-intoxicated psych patients range from self-harm to suicidal thinking to suicidal attempts to homicidal thinking to mass murder, and the media is silent on the psych drug connection. (For more on the large variety of aberrant behaviors strongly linked to the so-called SSRI antidepressants, go to www.ssristories.net.)  It is important to acknowledge that the mainstream media's uber-wealthy corporate media owners profit mightily from Big Pharma's prime time advertising. It is also important to acknowledge that these media elites also profit mightily from their Wall Street investments in the pharmaceutical industry sector. Given those realities it is just good business sense to suppress any unwelcome information that would adversely impact their corporate or personal bottom lines. And so the McCarthy-era black-listing of truth-tellers, uncorrupted scientists, authors, whistle-blowers and real journalists is the norm wherever corporations and the wealthy elite rule.  The four lists below identify particular personality traits and behaviors (as well as issues of family, school and social dynamics) that the FBI regards as important risk factors for many forms of violence, especially in the case of the American childhood and adolescent school shooters. The complete file, which is entitled: THE SCHOOL SHOOTER: A THREAT ASSESSMENT PERSPECTIVE, from which I have excerpted (and edited, in some cases) what I regard as the most useful information, can be accessed by googling the title.  As a physician that practiced holistic, non-drug, mental health care during the last ten years of my family practice career, and who has studied our uniquely American School Shooter epidemic, I agree with the content of these lists. However, as I will point out, item D3 (The Effects of Drugs and Alcohol) is woefully - and deceptively - inadequate.  I have personally and very carefully listened to the horrific stories of over a thousand psychologically-traumatized (and subsequently drug-intoxicated) patients who sought my care. All of them had been labeled with a large variety of ""mental illnesses of unknown cause"". Many of my patients confessed to me that I was the first doctor to have asked about their stories, listened to them or even seemed to care about the origins of their mental health issues. Virtually all of my patients had been told by their psychiatrists that they would have to be on drugs for the rest of their lives.

http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/GOP-candidates-take-aim-at-Chicago-gun-laws-6554595.php,"CHICAGO — The mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week thrust the debate over the nation’s gun laws to the center of the presidential race. At least some of the Republicans who are running have pointed to Chicago as proof that gun control doesn’t work. The city has a reputation for having some of the country’s strictest gun laws yet it has experienced an increase in homicides and shootings this year, which Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina say proves their point. “If you look at places like Chicago ... it’s got some of the single toughest gun laws in the United States and it’s a disaster,” the billionaire businessman Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” in August. Christie, who is New Jersey’s governor, echoed the sentiment Sunday, telling ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that homicides are up in cities like Chicago and New York, which he said have “some of the most aggressive gun laws.” Meanwhile Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said last month that “Chicago would be an example” of how places with some of the most “stringent gun control laws” also have the “highest gun crime rates in the nation,” according to Factcheck.org. But Chicago’s gun laws aren’t as tough as their reputation suggests. They once were, but courts have overturned or gutted many of them in recent years, forcing a city that once banned handguns and gun shops to allow them both. And even though gun shops can operate within Chicago’s city limits now, none has opened up yet. That means that every gun that is owned legally or illegally in Chicago came from somewhere else. Chicago’s Police Department seizes more illegal weapons than any other in the nation — nearly 20 a day for a total of 5,500 so far in 2015."
http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/oct/07/gun-demanding-control-firearms-psychology,"Much has been said about gun control in the wake of yet another mass shooting in the US, but the heated and divided nature of the debate means that a fundamental question is often overlooked; why is it people actively want guns in the first place? The answers are not as obvious as you may think Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST Once again, we’ve had yet another mass shooting in the US. That the previous sentence can even be written in a serious manner is a bleak summary of the situation. Even President Obama has clearly lost patience with the regularity of such horrific occurrences. As ever, the fallout includes endless scapegoating, political posturing and analysis. It all boils down to a large number of people not wanting to lose their guns under any circumstances.  Those opposed to gun control regularly cite the second amendment, granting US citizens the right to bear arms. But having the right to do something doesn’t make it mandatory. I have the right to smear myself in peanut butter and dance naked through my kitchen. But I don’t, because I have no interest in doing so. So why do millions of ordinary people see weapons that use controlled explosives to propel bits of metal at lethal speeds at people, and think “I need that in my house”. Basically, why do so many want guns? Given the diversity of gun owners, there isn’t going to be any comprehensive or obvious answer. However, there are a few scientific explanations that could help understand how this comes about. Despite the preconceptions of many, according to a Gallup poll from 2005, the most common reason given for gun ownership is protection. Just like large dogs or security lights, guns are something people have to ensure their safety from intruders. Some might argue this is a cop-out, something gun owners say to seem moral and credible, and maybe sometimes that’s fair. However, it’s also the most common answer given by juvenile offenders incarcerated for gun-related crimes. If you’re already in jail for gun crimes, it should be obvious why you wanted a gun, but still the most common answer among such people is “protection”. This may seem excessively paranoid to those of us in countries where guns aren’t so familiar, but in the US at least they’re much more commonplace. I remember being struck by this on my one visit there. Even the guy supervising a car park had a gun. Why? How often does a Chrysler go on a rampage and need to be brought down? Humans are all about self-preservation and prone to anticipating worst-case scenarios, so if you’re surrounded by people with guns, it would be logical to conclude you need one too. This doesn’t address why guns became so widespread to begin with, but it would explain why this situation persists. And if self-preservation rather than aggression is why you have a gun, you’d undoubtedly be loath to lose it. Another common answer for why people own guns is recreation. Target shooting and hunting are two popular recreational activities, and whatever you think of them, would explain ownership of guns by a substantial number of people. Sometimes the simple explanation is correct; people enjoy hobbies, and hobbies require equipment. Many gun owners confess to feeling vulnerable or “naked” without their guns. Perhaps this isn’t surprising; having a gun gives you considerable power over people. If you feel small, or weak, or underachieving, or anything like this, dealing with others can induce a great deal of social anxiety. A gun would provide at least one easy way where you can have the advantage over them for once, even if this reasoning only occurs at a subconscious level. Achieving high social status is important to your typical human, and guns can play a big role in this in cultures where they’re common. Trouble is, of course, if everyone else has a gun too, then it’s not so useful. So you need more guns, or bigger guns, and on it goes. The fact that it’s more often men who own guns suggests masculinity (toxic or otherwise) plays a part too. And while associating gun ownership with mental health issues is (rightly) considered shameless scapegoating, there is some evidence suggesting gun ownership correlates with tendencies towards anger and impulsivity. It’s reminiscent of how Douglas Adams described people who seek power, in that that those who want it the most are least suitable to have it. It’s now common to see people queuing up for days on end to buy the latest iPhone. Sacrificing home comforts and hours/days of their lives, even travelling great distances, purely to buy a device which is slightly different to one they already own. Why? Clearly there are social and cultural factors that mean owning an up-to-date iPhone is absolutely essential to many people. Why wouldn’t this be true of guns to others? If you grow up and are immersed in a culture where gun ownership is the norm, even praised, of course this is going to influence your attitudes. Earlier suggestions that gun owners are “making excuses” for having firearms don’t make sense when you consider that, for many, owning a gun is a good thing, something to be praised for. They wouldn’t make excuses if they saw nothing that needed excusing. Guns being a status symbol or highly-valued accessory, like iPhones and the like, would explain sheer variety of guns available, at least in the US. If guns were purely for home protection, then you’d only need one basic sort, maybe two. But no, gun enthusiasts often end up owning a wide variety of them. Unless they anticipate being besieged by armed mobs (which could be the case), this makes more sense when you assume that guns infer social status in the culture in which someone is immersed, meaning more or better guns provide higher status. Polarisation can push this even further, beyond any rational limits. Everything else There are many other possible factors that could result in someone wanting a gun, most of which probably aren’t even hinted at here. Gun ownership is more common amongst those with right—wing views, so a stronger self-interest, authoritarian personality and mistrust of other groups may make a gun feel like more of an essential item. Modern entertainment is saturated with guns, usually in the context of good guys using them to deal with less desirable sorts. What we see in the media can, within reason, affect our views and behaviour, so if guns are regularly seen being used to save the day, then no doubt this will rub off on some. Similarly, the making and selling of guns is also a very lucrative industry, so the companies behind it are going to promote the benefits of firearms as often as possible. And, sadly, you always seem to get the people who acquire guns purely to do harm to others, for whatever warped reasoning motivates them. This piece isn’t meant to justify gun ownership, it’s just an attempt to look at how it becomes so commonplace, and why so many people defend it in the face of an ever-increasing list of tragedies. Understanding why people want to own a gun should be essential to better regulate them, because if you just rely on condemnation and blanket criticism of gun owners, they aren’t going to simply agree and hand over their weapons. They’re more likely to double down and become even more adamant that they’re in the right, making gun control ever more difficult. With an issue so serious, this is the last thing anyone needs. Dean Burnett attempted to write an objective, neutral article on the issue of gun ownership and has no doubt failed spectacularly. He’s on Twitter, @garwboy"

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/-6xnUOIjuOI/,"According to 2016 presidential hopeful Ben Carson, it is ""more devastating"" for Americans to lose their Second Amendment gun rights than it would be to see a ""body with bullet holes."" This statement has ignited controversy all over social media, and some news media even claim Carson is not qualified to become a U.S. president based upon his previous comments. In a related report by the Inquisitr, the increase in California gun control laws led to the closing of the last San Francisco gun shop in the entire city. Although the law had to be passed, the gun shop says customers were made to feel like criminals, and the resulting drop in sales forced them to close their doors. On October 2, 2015, Ben Carson also asked that his Facebook followers update their profile photo to honor the victims and families of the Oregon shooting. Apparently, over two million people honored this request by using a photo that had the #IamAChristian hashtag.  One email came from a man named Dan who asked if the Oregon shooting had in any way altered Ben Carson's gun control position, or if he still supported the Second Amendment as written. Carson says the mass shooting has not affected his position, but the way he answered has angered some. ""I grew up in the slums of Detroit. I saw plenty of gun violence as a child. Both of my cousins were killed on the streets. As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. Serious people seek serious solutions,"" Carson wrote on Facebook. ""The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda. To me, that is also devastatingly sad. The Left would have you believe that a man that asked Christians to stand up (and then executed them one by one) would obey 'new gun laws'. That kind of logic explains many of the problems we find ourselves in today."" Ben Carson's ""more devastating"" statement has received mixed reactions, but he also shot back at critics who say that his expertise as a neurosurgeon would not prepare him for the presidency. ""You don't need to know nearly as much to be able to maneuver in the political world as you do in the operating room inside of somebody's brain. It's not even close,"" he said, according to the Washington Informer. Last week, Carson also said incidents like the Oregon shooting should lead to a focus on preventing dangerous persons from committing mass shootings rather than taking away gun rights. ""We should be looking at all of the incidents where we have these people who go out and commit horrendous crimes to find out as much as we can about what type of person does this,"" Carson said, according to the Washington Times. ""The issue is the mentality of these people. And we need to be looking at the mentality of these individuals and seeing if there [are] any early warning clues that we can gather that will help us as a society to be able to identify these people ahead of time."" Carson's ""more devastating"" comment falls in line with his previous stance since he believes that more gun control laws only work for ""normal, law-abiding citizens,"" not the ""crazies.""

Nine people were killed and nine others seriously injured. It was the 294th mass shooting in our country in 274 days. The same day as the massacre in Oregon, North Carolina’s law imposing a 72-hour waiting period to have an abortion went into effect. North Carolina is now tied with Missouri as having the longest waiting period for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to abortion.  What do these things have in common? What possible corollary could I be drawing between such seemingly disparate events? The short answer is: North Carolina doesn’t have a waiting period to buy a gun. Just days before the Oregon shooting, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee – led by chairman Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah – held a hearing at which Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards was aggressively grilled over the contents of several edited “sting” videos in a ridiculous show of interruptions and grandstanding. As everyone knows – and law enforcement agencies have confirmed – Planned Parenthood has done nothing wrong, and Richards proved that easily, despite hostile questioning from the majority GOP members determined to rally their base over the issue of denying women critical health care. Planned Parenthood provides needed, essential health care to 2.7 million Americans – male, female, cisgender, transgender, poor, underserved, and rural populations – each year. These services save lives, help keep families healthy and intact and prevent thousands of unintended pregnancies which, as every relevant health study has shown, reduces the rate of abortion. Yet while this Congress wastes millions of dollars investigating debunked claims of an imaginary “baby parts” black market, they refuse to even consider funding a simple, non-binding study on the effects of gun violence on public health, which causes more deaths each year than in any other industrialized nation on Earth. The hypocrisy of GOP “pro-life” ideology has become a joke. While 51 new abortion restrictions have been enacted at the state level this first half of this year alone, not a single bill has reached the floor of the US House that would attempt to address gun violence. Millions of taxpayer dollars are wasted investigating a health care organization that saves lives and, sometimes, provides a constitutionally-protected and necessary health care procedure that interrupts pregnancy. Yet we are told it’s not worth spending a cent to learn how to save the lives of living, breathing, studying, working, family-raising human beings. The policies of those who claim to care for nothing more than protecting human life are a straw man argument to prevent women from exercising their right to bodily autonomy and participating fully in social, economic, and democratic life. Unsafe abortions kill 47,000 women annually around the world; there is a strong, continuing correlation between deaths from unsafe abortion and countries where the procedure is illegal or its access is significantly restricted. Meanwhile, guns kill 2.3 out of every 100,000 women in in the US. Women here are 11 times more likely to die from gun violence than in any other developed country. Legal abortion is even markedly, dramatically, absurdly more safe than childbirth, resulting in .06 deaths per 100,000 each year in the United States. Safe abortion reduces maternal mortality – and states with higher abortion restrictions see an increase in maternal death rates. Today, though, 28 states require a waiting period ranging from 24 to 72 hours to obtain an abortion. But only nine states require any waiting period at all to purchase a gun. There are 35 states that require so-called “abortion counseling” before a procedure, which may include misleading or outright false information dictated by the state legislature in a script that your doctor must read, whether they know it to be false or not. Some 24 states require an unnecessary ultrasound. But only six states require any form of training or certification courses to purchase a gun. In Wisconsin, a child 14 years of age may carry a gun to hunt without a guardian or adult present. But, as in 20 other states, any minor under the age of 18 must have the legal consent of a parent to obtain an abortion. Republicans’ insistence upon absolute, unfettered freedom to own, carry, or stockpile weapons stands in stark contrast to their dedication to restricting women’s personal choices. Potential life – with all its promise and power – means far more to these demagogues than the actual lives of people here on Earth, now. For the personhood of embryos, they draft legislation. For the safety of living, playing, laughing children, they do nothing. The potential dreams of a not-yet-sentient organism are paramount – not because it is a human life, as demonstrated by their lack of commitment to actual living humans, but because it is inside of a woman. And that woman must not be permitted to do as she pleases or else all Hell may break loose. So long as women know their place, we must assume, no amount of blood spilled is too much to protect the status quo. Meanwhile, Hell is already here."

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/115975383/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Some-police-say-they-have-no-authority-to-seize-weapons-from-those-atrisk/,"WASHINGTON — More than a third of top police officials either believe they have no legal authority or did not know whether they could seize firearms from people who have been determined by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others, according to a recent national survey of local law enforcement authorities. Of those officials who believed they had such authority, more than half said they rarely or never used it in the past year, according to the survey of 266 agencies representing 42 states conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based law enforcement advocacy group. Moreover, 60% of respondents said their agencies had no program or protocol for carrying out firearm confiscations. The striking responses come amid a renewed debate about the availability of firearms, prompted by yet another deadly mass shooting that so far has only underscored the challenges to blocking the mentally ill and emotionally disturbed from obtaining and using guns. Some analysts said the survey identifies another troubling loophole in firearm access: confusion over the extent of basic law enforcement authority and a genuine lack of it. ""This is clearly not an everyday part of law enforcement, and it should be,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""In most cases there is not a good process for removing guns. This is an area of big concern. We're allowing people to be armed when they are considered to be most dangerous.'' Federal law prohibits firearms purchases from licensed dealers to people who have been found mentally defective, incompetent to handle their own personal affairs and those involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Yet uneven compliance with reporting such data to state and federal authorities for vetting firearms purchasers has made the identification of those at risk more difficult, authorities said. USA TODAY In face of criticism, police officials preaching de-escalation tactics USA TODAY Guns are not the only deadly weapon for mass killers ""This is a problem,'' said Richard Beary, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ""I'm not surprised that officers are apprehensive or intimidated ... If there is a question, I would rather we confiscate. If we get hit with a lawsuit, then I'll deal with it.'' Perhaps the most prominent firearm confiscation effort in the country, the so-called Armed and Prohibited Persons program, is overseen by the California Department of Justice, where agents have seized thousands of firearms since 2001. The system identifies people who previously purchased one or more guns legally but later have become ineligible to possess firearms due to criminal criminal conviction, mental instability or other conditions. Since 2013, agents have conducted 14,012 investigations, recovering prohibited firearms in a majority of those cases, California Justice Department spokeswoman Kristin Ford said. There were still an estimated 15,662 suspected prohibited weapons owners in California, according to the most recent accounting by the state, which Ford said represents the fewest number since 2009. In Prince George's County, Md., gun confiscations are generally carried out in conjunction with a formal court hearing, resulting in an order from the judge, county police spokeswoman Julie Parker said. In cases when officers are responding to calls and there is a belief that the situation has become unsafe due to the presence of a firearm, Parker said officers have ""the discretion to seize a firearm and send to our property warehouse for safekeeping.'' Parker said the department does not specifically track the number of weapons seized. ""This is something we definitely have to look at,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ""There is considerable support for police stepping in when there is an immediate threat of harm ... Obviously, we should be getting a 100% response'' from police related to their procedures for confiscating weapons. ""This is an area that's just not talked about enough,'' Wexler said. ""There are so many situations involving the mentally ill or emotionally disturbed with some type of weapon.'' Follow @bykevinj on Twitter."

It's an adage followed by many politicians, including former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, whose newest book hits shelves Tuesday, as the surprise 2016 GOP presidential candidate continues to surge in the polls. ""A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties,"" co-authored by Dr. Carson and his wife, Candy, and published by Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, uses the US Constitution to explore current events and controversial issues. ""As someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery.... In our age of political correctness it's especially important to defend the Bill of Rights, which guarantees our freedom to speak, bear arms, practice our religion, and much more,"" Carson said in a preview of the book. Carson, a celebrated retired pediatric neurosurgeon captured national attention when he criticized President Obama at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. His comments won him conservative fans who encouraged him to enter politics. He is now one of three surprise contenders in the GOP presidential race with no political experience who are surging in the polls. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls, Trump runs first in the Republican field at 23 percent, followed by Carson at 17 percent, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 11 percent. ""A More Perfect Union"" is one of at least seven books, many of which have become bestsellers, penned by the former neurosurgeon. While the book is largely a 253-page primer of the 16-page Constitution covering the basics like the history, challenges to, and purpose of the founding document, Carson has recently used the topic as a means to speak out about controversial topics. For example, he told USA Today's weekly paper, Capital Download, his philosophy on gun control is grounded in the Constitution. The lessons from the latest mass shooting aren't to enact more limits on guns, he says, but to identify and treat mentally ill people, arm teachers, and question whether gun-free zones attract shooters. ""If I had a little kid in kindergarten somewhere I would feel much more comfortable if I knew on that campus there was a police officer or somebody who was trained with a weapon,"" he told Capital Download. ""If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" Carson recently came under fire for making comments suggesting he would not support a Muslim in the White House, a comment critics called unconstitutional. In September, Carson told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd he doesn’t believe Islam is compatible with the Constitution and “would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” In fact, the Constitution does not permit a national religion or a religious test for public office. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Still, Carson tells Fox News he wrote the book to educate others about the founding document ""Everyone knows we have a constitution but not many know what's in it, and the Constitution is there to protect us, the people,"" he told Fox News. ""It's 16 and one-third pages long, written at the level of an 8th grader, and they did that specifically so the people would understand what the foundation of our country is,"" he said.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

        Mark Arce Posted on October 7, 2015, at 10:35 a.m. ET Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 1998 book Kids Who Kill is full of spurious quotations from leading American political figures, mostly the country's founding fathers. A number of the quotations, such as those from Washington and Jefferson, have been routinely debunked by libraries of the past presidents but still regularly find their way into books from conservative figures. Other quotes, debunked by prominent historians, seem to be used for the first time in the book. The book was co-written with evangelical author George Grant in response to a mass shooting in Arkansas. The book links that shooting to the decline in America's moral culture. The quotes, from figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry, are often used to reinforce Huckabee's moral viewpoint. Huckabee isn't the first Republican presidential to attribute fake quotes to America's founders. Ben Carson, Rand Paul, and former candidate Scott Walker have all done so. ""That book was co-authored, and I'm not sure which one wrote those, but we appreciate you reading the book,"" a Huckabee spokesman said. However, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, ""this quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson."" Another quote attributed to Jefferson read, ""Any woodsman can tell you that in a broken and sundered nest, one can hardly expect to find more than a precious few whole eggs. So it is with the family."" Neither the Thomas Jefferson Foundation nor The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University could verify the quote. ""I have searched our presidential files using woodsman, nest, and family as keywords and have not found this quote,"" The Papers of Thomas Jefferson wrote to BuzzFeed News in a statement. Huckabee's cites ""King's Signet Book's"" in his book as the source for the quote, but a search for the source only turns up links to Huckabee's book and another book, Revolution: Jesus' Call to Change the World. ""The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington, particularly in regards to his farewell address of 1796,"" writes the National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. Huckabee also attributed multiple quotes to founding father Patrick Henry that are unverifiable and sourced only to Huckabee's book or a book cited by Huckabee. ""The manners of a gentleman are an outgrowth of his due respect for the life and integrity of others; likewise a breach of courtesy is emblematic not so much of barbarism as of utter and complete self-absorption. A rude man is but a callous egotist,"" reads one quote attributed to Henry. The only source available for this is Huckabee's book. The quote is not cited in the book. Another quote attributed to Henry, ""For good or for ill, the estate of the family will most assuredly predetermine the estate of all of the rest of the culture,"" could again only be sourced back to Huckabee. One prominent historian, Baylor professor Thomas S. Kidd, who authored Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots, told BuzzFeed News he had not seen the quotes before. ""Those are new ones to me. Like you, I cannot find any hits on them except for the Huckabee book,"" Kidd told BuzzFeed News. Another quote attributed to Henry in Huckabee's book can also be found in a different book from Huckabee's co-author, but in that book it's attributed to Pope Leo XIII. Huckabee's book reads: ""Patrick Henry argued, 'The contention that the civil government should at its option intrude into and exercise control over the family and the household is a great and pernicious error.'"" ""The philosophy of the classroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next,"" reads on quote attributed to Lincoln. The quote is untraceable to Lincoln and is often listed as an unconfirmed quote. ""It looks like that quote began appearing in various evangelical books attributing it to Lincoln at some point in the 1990s, but beyond that I don't know its origins,"" Lincoln scholar and Dickinson College professor Matthew Pinsker. ""It's certainly not Lincoln, or to be precise, there's no evidence that it comes from any of Lincoln's writings and no recollected account that I know of which even claims this line as his."" Another quote attributed to Lincoln in the book (""We are indeed, the almost chosen people"") seems to be a slight misread of an address Lincoln gave to the New Jersey legislature in February of 1861, where he is quoted by the New York Times as saying, ""I shall be most happy in lead if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, as the chosen instrument, also in the hands of the almighty, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle."" Huckabee and his co-author also attributed a quote to Samuel Adams (""without civility, there can be no society,"") that, upon searching, could only be found in his book and a 1999 column in a South Carolina newspaper written by a wedding consultant. Finally, a quote attributed to founding father Gouverneur Morris is not only a fake quote but a misattribution of a fake quote. ""The Constitution is not an instrument for government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government—lest it come to dominate our lives and interests,"" read the quote attributed to Morris. This quote is fake as noted by prominent historians, and is usually attributed to Patrick Henry. Andrew Kaczynski is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/115975383/0/phoenix/nation~Striking-number-of-cops-leery-of-confiscating-guns/,"WASHINGTON — More than a third of top police officials either believe they have no legal authority or did not know whether they could seize firearms from people who have been determined by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others, according to a recent national survey of local law enforcement authorities. Of those officials who believed they had such authority, more than half said they rarely or never used it in the past year, according to the survey of 266 agencies representing 42 states conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based law enforcement advocacy group. Moreover, 60% of respondents said their agencies had no program or protocol for carrying out firearm confiscations. The striking responses come amid a renewed debate about the availability of firearms, prompted by yet another deadly mass shooting that so far has only underscored the challenges to blocking the mentally ill and emotionally disturbed from obtaining and using guns. Some analysts said the survey identifies another troubling loophole in firearm access: confusion over the extent of basic law enforcement authority and a genuine lack of it. ""This is clearly not an everyday part of law enforcement, and it should be,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""In most cases there is not a good process for removing guns. This is an area of big concern. We're allowing people to be armed when they are considered to be most dangerous.'' Federal law prohibits firearms purchases from licensed dealers to people who have been found mentally defective, incompetent to handle their own personal affairs and those involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Yet uneven compliance with reporting such data to state and federal authorities for vetting firearms purchasers has made the identification of those at risk more difficult, authorities said. USA TODAY In face of criticism, police officials preaching de-escalation tactics USA TODAY Guns are not the only deadly weapon for mass killers ""This is a problem,'' said Richard Beary, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ""I'm not surprised that officers are apprehensive or intimidated ... If there is a question, I would rather we confiscate. If we get hit with a lawsuit, then I'll deal with it.'' Perhaps the most prominent firearm confiscation effort in the country, the so-called Armed and Prohibited Persons program, is overseen by the California Department of Justice, where agents have seized thousands of firearms since 2001. The system identifies people who previously purchased one or more guns legally but later have become ineligible to possess firearms due to criminal criminal conviction, mental instability or other conditions. Since 2013, agents have conducted 14,012 investigations, recovering prohibited firearms in a majority of those cases, California Justice Department spokeswoman Kristin Ford said. There were still an estimated 15,662 suspected prohibited weapons owners in California, according to the most recent accounting by the state, which Ford said represents the fewest number since 2009. In Prince George's County, Md., gun confiscations are generally carried out in conjunction with a formal court hearing, resulting in an order from the judge, county police spokeswoman Julie Parker said. In cases when officers are responding to calls and there is a belief that the situation has become unsafe due to the presence of a firearm, Parker said officers have ""the discretion to seize a firearm and send to our property warehouse for safekeeping.'' Parker said the department does not specifically track the number of weapons seized. ""This is something we definitely have to look at,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ""There is considerable support for police stepping in when there is an immediate threat of harm ... Obviously, we should be getting a 100% response'' from police related to their procedures for confiscating weapons. ""This is an area that's just not talked about enough,'' Wexler said. ""There are so many situations involving the mentally ill or emotionally disturbed with some type of weapon.'' Follow @bykevinj on Twitter."

(AP Photo via Chris Pietsch/The Register-Guard) (Chris Pietsch) ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The gunman who fatally shot nine people at an Oregon community college last week killed himself in front of his victims after two police officers wounded him, authorities said Wednesday. When two plainclothes detectives spotted Christopher Harper-Mercer in the doorway of a campus building, he fired at them, and the officers quickly returned fire. The killer then went back inside and shot himself in a classroom where many of his victims lay dead and wounded, a prosecutor told a news conference. It was authorities' most detailed account yet of the gunman's death. Previously, they had said only that the 26-year-old attacker killed himself after a shootout. The detectives arrived within minutes of the first reports of gunfire at Umpqua Community College. Seconds later, the officers ""both felt they had a good target,"" Douglas County District Attorney Rick Wesenberg said. Two of their bullets hit a wall. A third struck Harper-Mercer on the right side. The wounded gunman ""entered the classroom again, went to the front of the classroom and shot and killed himself,"" Wesenberg said. The attack in this rural timber town was the worst mass shooting in Oregon history. Eight students and a teacher died. Nine others were wounded. A private memorial has been held for Lawrence Levine, who was killed while teaching the class. Another private service was held Wednesday for 44-year-old Sarena Dawn Moore of Myrtle Creek. More funerals are scheduled through Saturday. Investigators have not yet shared any motive for the killings. They have seized 14 guns -- six found at the college and eight at the apartment Harper-Mercer shared with his mother on the outskirts of Roseburg. Authorities have said the gunman's mother told them her son was struggling with mental health issues, but no details have been released. Harper-Mercer and his mother shared a love of firearms and would go to shooting ranges together.

In separate interviews with news media Tuesday and Wednesday, Carson described how he would have reacted if he'd been caught up in the shooting at Umpqua Community College on Thursday.

""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, `Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me but he can't get us all,'"" the Republican neurosurgeon told Fox News' Fox & Friends Tuesday.
""I said what I would do. ... I would ask everyone to attack the gunman,"" he subsequently told ABC News. ""That way we wouldn't all end up dead.""
Carson, who is still receiving criticism for remarking last month that he would not approve of a Muslim U.S. president, has been stumping for president as he hopes to secure the GOP nomination.
The Republican's new remarks are now attracting yet more criticism from some who have said Carson appears to be blaming the victims -- nine of whom were killed and another nine who were wounded by the gunman.

President Barack Obama plans to travel to Roseburg, Ore., on Friday to meet with families of the victims, but several community members are criticizing the trip because they believe it's an attempt by the president to politicize the tragedy.
Carson is perhaps facing even harsher criticism for his reply to a question from Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade, who hypothetically asked, ""Dr. Carson, would you go? If the people of the community say, 'don't go,' would you still go if you're president on Friday?""
""Probably not,"" Carson replied. ""I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I would go to the next [shooting].""
""When comments like Republican candidate Ben Carson condemning President Obama's decision to visit and console the families in Roseburg in a private meeting, that somehow he would wait for the next one? It's stunning,"" Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said.
""I can't imagine a more callous, heartless remark than that,"" he added.
Carson again appeared on Fox News Wednesday and defended his remarks from a day earlier, saying that the fallout is merely a product of typical politicking that is being aided by the national news media.

""We are living in a culture now where you have a group of people who just sit there, they don't try to listen to what you're saying. They are just trying to find a defect so that they can cause more division,"" Carson said. ""They are trying to divide our nation.""
Carson then dismissed a question from anchor Martha MacCallum, who asked if he should exercise greater caution in communicating remarks to the public, saying, ""I think people know exactly what I'm saying, and they know exactly what the media is trying to do.
""So I'm not going to change and become, you know, a vanilla envelope that they can accept.

http://theweek.com/articles/581375/big-problem-liberal-solutions-americas-horrible-gun-violence-problem,"CENGIZ YAR, JR./AFP/Getty Images) To hear some politicians tell it, the only thing standing in the way of preventing tragedies such as the Oregon community college massacre is the zealots of the National Rifle Association. Were it not for the NRA and its money, the argument runs, Congress would do the right thing and stop the easy access to guns. Republicans in particular ""wage a right-wing ideological crusade fashioned by the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America,"" according to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. (Can you believe the NRA considered endorsing Reid just five years ago?) But the growing gulf between what liberals appear to believe drives the country's problem with gun violence and the measures they are openly proposing to solve it suggests they realize that there is more to it than the gun lobby's intransigence. The implication of recent comments by President Obama and Hillary Clinton isn't simply that we have too few gun control laws, although they do contend that explicitly. It is that America has too many guns. Some of their grassroots supporters say it out loud. At Vox, Dylan Matthews writes that ""large-scale confiscation [looks] like easily the most promising approach for bringing U.S. gun homicides down to European rates."" MoveOn.org circulated a petition to repeal the Second Amendment. The liberal writer Amanda Marcotte averred in Rolling Stone that the amendment ""was written by slaveholders before we had electricity"" and that its enthusiasts should ""feel free to live in a powdered wig and shit in a chamberpot while trying to survive off what you can kill with an 18th century musket."" Many identify Australia and Great Britain, countries where there are sweeping restrictions on private firearms ownership, as models for the U.S. to follow on gun control. Yet Obama and Clinton actually propose little more than expanded background checks, something that won't put a dent in our vast supply of guns. Before its vaunted 1996 law that instigated a buyback of hundreds of thousands of firearms and severely restricted their possession, Australia had a personal gun ownership rate of only about 7 percent compared to 34 percent in the contemporary United States. Even if gun control down under had been effective, which is a matter of some debate, it is of limited applicability to America. Indeed, a Harvard study frequently cited in support of the Australian law says in its conclusion, ""It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States."" There has always been a culture war element to the American gun control debate. Cities in blue states with tough gun laws nevertheless have high rates of gun crime, while well-armed rural citizens where the laws are lax — such as Bernie Sanders' Vermont — enjoy relatively low rates of crime. The hope is that imposing stricter gun controls on the latter will reduce the supply available to the former. The horrors of recent mass shooting episodes have at least some liberals contemplating a more direct challenge to America's gun culture. Their politicians may share their anger, but they don't yet share their enthusiasm for such a quixotic quest. Background checks and assault weapons bans are practically the only viable gun control measures not because of the NRA's money or power but because of the high number of guns in the United States, the very fact that proponents who would like to go further lament. Gun buybacks are unlikely to work. Confiscation would pose serious constitutional problems to the Fourth Amendment as well as the Second. The 300 million guns already here and the significant private demand for weapons would make for a potent black market. And the political resistance that tougher gun control would face comes from a large number of engaged gun owners for whom this is a salient issue, not just nefarious groups seeking to organize them. Far too many people have lost their lives due to guns. The seeming frequency of mass shootings makes a desire for easy fixes understandable, as is the anger and frustration that makes polemicists on behalf of gun control tire of hearing pro-gun counterarguments. But neither the sincerity of those feelings nor the seriousness of the underlying problem obviate the obligation to spell out what policies are really being proposed here and marshal evidence that they will actually work.

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/07/video-a-gun-free-america-in-5-easy-steps/,"Want to stop gun violence? Dare to dream of a gun-free America, progressives claim as they demand action to curtail access to firearms after the mass shooting in Oregon. Reason TV dared to dream of how to get to a gun-free America, and found that it’s as easy as these five steps. Except … it’s not that easy, and it’s going to make the situation much, much worse: It’s amusing, of course, but I’d bet progressives can do this in fewer steps. All they need is three or four Supreme Court appointments, and at some point we’ll end up watching the discovery of a right to be safe from gun violence. The Second Amendment will suddenly only apply to militias, and confiscations will become all the rage, in one or more senses. That’s something to keep in mind when debating the nuances of the primary season, yes? Meanwhile, Eugene Volokh points out that the homicide rate correlation in states with lower gun-control regulation not only doesn’t exist, it may actually lean the other way: The correlation between the homicide rate and Brady score in all 51 jurisdictions is +.032 (on a scale of -1 to +1), which means that states with more gun restrictions on average have very slightly higher homicide rates, though the tendency is so small as to be essentially zero. (If you omit the fatal gun accident rates, then the correlation would be +.065, which would make the more gun-restricting states look slightly worse; but again, the correlation would be small enough to be essentially zero, given all the other possible sources of variation.) If we use the National Journal data (adding the columns for each state, counting 1 for each dark blue, which refers to broad restrictions, 0.5 for each light blue, which refers to medium restrictions, and 0 for each grey, which refers to no or light restrictions), the results are similar: +0.017 or +0.051 if one omits the fatal gun accident rates. … Perhaps there are other confounding factors (such as demographics, economics, and so on). Perhaps even controlling for those factors, there will be other missing factors that are hard to control for — for instance, maybe as the crime rate increases, calls for gun controls increase, so high crime causes more gun restrictions, or maybe calls for more freedom to defend oneself increase, so high crime causes fewer gun restrictions (e.g., liberalized concealed-carry licensing rules). And of course when small changes in the model yield substantial changes in results (e.g., if you calculate the state gun scores differently, the results will likely be different), you know how little you should credit the output. Figuring out the actual effect of government actions, whether gun laws, changed policing rules, drug laws, or anything else, is devilishly difficult. But since people have been talking about simple two-variable correlations between gun laws and crime, I thought it would be helpful to note this correlation — or, rather, absence of correlation. Duly noted, but that won’t stop the demands for action in the face of tragedy. Let’s just be glad that our form of government is designed to force legislators to slow down and proceed carefully while forming larger consensuses. At least, it has until now, anyway. We’re about three steps from seeing that dissipate, too. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved."

http://www.startribune.com/politics/331179751.html,"One after another, firearms of varying calibers cracked and thumped at Bill’s Gun Range in Robbinsdale. On a Tuesday afternoon, the recreational shooters represented a wide range of ages, ethnic background and experience. Stephen Kwong, 24, of Eagan, hadn’t fired a gun at the range in two years, but decided to swing by after lunch one day last week, bringing with him his friend, first-timer Jessica Wong, 21. In the wake of the latest mass shooting, this one at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Kwong remained steadfast that while everyone should have gun training, the right to bear arms should be inviolate and restricting gun rights will not prevent future carnage. “I mean, look around,” Kwong said. “For $73, two of us were standing inside with a bunch of other people who don’t know each other with guns. The deadliest place could be right here.” Nevertheless, gun control supporters say they are more motivated than ever to apply the kind of sustained pressure gun rights advocates have brought to bear. Brian Rusche, executive director of the Joint Religious Legislative Coalition, said his organization has undertaken similar efforts before, but amped up its efforts since nine African-Americans were killed last June during a similar mass shooting at a Charleston, S.C., church. “I’m almost ashamed to say this, but in a way previous shootings jostled us but maybe we became complacent,” he said. “Charleston gripped us.” Then, he said, as they were preparing a bill for the 2016 legislative session, “Oregon happens.” Now Rusche is determined to find a reasonable consensus with the gun owners lobby, rather than the bruising debates of the past. “I’m convinced we can save lives, and we can come to reasonable gun laws if we can show that gun policies could save lives without compromising Second Amendment rights,” he said. Back at the gun range, Ashlee Hutchinson, 23, of St. Paul, would also like to see a balance struck. Hutchison says she grew up with what she calls a healthy respect and fear of guns, thanks to a father who was also a firearms enthusiast. Hutchinson brought her friend, Jeremy Wilson, 19, also a first-timer. Both said they think the vetting process for obtaining a gun should be as stringent as possible, while allowing legal owners to carry. They say everyday violence is just as disconcerting as random mass shootings. “They get in the hands of the wrong people, anything can happen.” Hutchinson said. “That’s putting other people at risk, and it’s not right.” The issue is one that cuts deeply in a state where many consider gun ownership a birthright. Some 200,000 Minnesotans hold permits to carry a handgun, and advocates estimate that about half of the state’s households have a gun on the premises. Gun control advocates say they are preparing to push Minnesota to close the so-called “gun show loophole,” by requiring background checks for any firearm sales — not just from licensed dealers. They also want to renew a push for short-term gun violence restraining orders that would allow law enforcement officers to temporarily confiscate firearms with a judge’s signoff in cases of potential domestic violence or suicide. It’s modeled after a “red flag” bill passed in California last year. Senate Democrats in Washington are expected Thursday to unveil a national proposal that will focus on extended background checks. Andrew Rothman, president of the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, said none of those measures will stop the shootings. “Everybody agrees that if there’s something we can do to make these rare and horrible things even more rare, we should do it,” he said. “But the caveat … is that it has to be something that will actually help. We know a common thread running through these mass murders is mental illness. But at the same time we can’t pick these murderers out from millions of other Americans that have similar mental health issues but never turn violent.” Abrogating the rights of law-abiding citizens will do little, he said. In fact, proponents of gun rights are looking to expand them. One of their proposals would remove the “duty to retreat” from Minnesota’s self-defense laws, and authorize “Constitutional Carry.” That would allow anyone not prohibited from carrying a firearm to pack a gun without additional paperwork, training or a sheriff’s signoff. Rob Doar, political director of the Minnesota Gun Owners Political Action Committee, said that he isn’t confident Constitutional Carry will gain much traction here, but that the proposal is intended to start a dialogue and possibly lower permit-to-carry application fees, which vary from county to county — the most expensive among them in Hennepin and Ramsey counties. Doar, who like Rothman is a firearms instructor, said he believes that anyone who carries a firearm should be properly trained, but that being forced to pay for training and application “is the equivalent of a poll tax to exercise a constitutional right.” Traction unlikely Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, chairman of the House Public Safety and Crime Prevention Policy and Finance Committee, said he does not intend to hear any gun-related legislation unless it somehow addresses mental illness. “In other words, it sounds like it’s getting to be a tired cliché nationally, but I agree that we have a mentally ill problem, not a gun problem,” said Cornish, a longtime proponent of gun rights. “Plus, I don’t think the DFL has any appetite in an election year to look like gun control advocates.” State Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and last year sponsored the “red flag” bill. Latz said he’s made no decisions, but is interested in moving toward universal background checks for firearm purchases and the “red flag” bill. Latz notes that such a law would have allowed family members of either the Oregon or South Carolina shooters to petition a judge to remove weapons from the house if they harbored concerns. “I think from the public standpoint, both of these would get really good traction, but whether they get traction legislatively is a different story, because vigorous gun rights advocates resist any steps in these directions,” Latz said. Heather Martens, executive director of Protect Minnesota, said she sees momentum for what she prefers to call “gun violence prevention.” “I think people are getting really sick of the bloodshed,” she said. Martens pointed out that 80 percent of Minnesota gun deaths are suicides. A red flag law, she said, could possibly curb those. In addition, she said, “It seems like there’s an increasing trend for suicidal people to go to public places and take others with them.” As he cased up his gun at Bill’s, Bruce Tix, 65, a Navy veteran from Inver Grove Heights, said he thinks Minnesota laws have treated gun owners well. Tix has his own theory on why mass shootings keep happening. “They’re blaming guns for the problem and it’s not the problem,” he said. “The problem is a moral issue. Many, many years ago, people wouldn’t have done this.”  Abby Simons is the Star Tribune’s Public Safety Editor. Her team covers crime and courts across the metro.

        Mark Arce Posted on October 7, 2015, at 10:35 a.m. ET Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 1998 book Kids Who Kill is full of spurious quotations from leading American political figures, mostly the country's founding fathers. A number of the quotations, such as those from Washington and Jefferson, have been routinely debunked by libraries of the past presidents but still regularly find their way into books from conservative figures. Other quotes, debunked by prominent historians, seem to be used for the first time in the book. The book was co-written with evangelical author George Grant in response to a mass shooting in Arkansas. The book links that shooting to the decline in America's moral culture. The quotes, from figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry, are often used to reinforce Huckabee's moral viewpoint. Huckabee isn't the first Republican presidential to attribute fake quotes to America's founders. Ben Carson, Rand Paul, and former candidate Scott Walker have all done so. ""That book was co-authored, and I'm not sure which one wrote those, but we appreciate you reading the book,"" a Huckabee spokesman said. However, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, ""this quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson."" Another quote attributed to Jefferson read, ""Any woodsman can tell you that in a broken and sundered nest, one can hardly expect to find more than a precious few whole eggs. So it is with the family."" Neither the Thomas Jefferson Foundation nor The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University could verify the quote. ""I have searched our presidential files using woodsman, nest, and family as keywords and have not found this quote,"" The Papers of Thomas Jefferson wrote to BuzzFeed News in a statement. Huckabee's cites ""King's Signet Book's"" in his book as the source for the quote, but a search for the source only turns up links to Huckabee's book and another book, Revolution: Jesus' Call to Change the World. ""The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington, particularly in regards to his farewell address of 1796,"" writes the National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. Huckabee also attributed multiple quotes to founding father Patrick Henry that are unverifiable and sourced only to Huckabee's book or a book cited by Huckabee. ""The manners of a gentleman are an outgrowth of his due respect for the life and integrity of others; likewise a breach of courtesy is emblematic not so much of barbarism as of utter and complete self-absorption. A rude man is but a callous egotist,"" reads one quote attributed to Henry. The only source available for this is Huckabee's book. The quote is not cited in the book. Another quote attributed to Henry, ""For good or for ill, the estate of the family will most assuredly predetermine the estate of all of the rest of the culture,"" could again only be sourced back to Huckabee. One prominent historian, Baylor professor Thomas S. Kidd, who authored Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots, told BuzzFeed News he had not seen the quotes before. ""Those are new ones to me. Like you, I cannot find any hits on them except for the Huckabee book,"" Kidd told BuzzFeed News. Another quote attributed to Henry in Huckabee's book can also be found in a different book from Huckabee's co-author, but in that book it's attributed to Pope Leo XIII. Huckabee's book reads: ""Patrick Henry argued, 'The contention that the civil government should at its option intrude into and exercise control over the family and the household is a great and pernicious error.'"" ""The philosophy of the classroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next,"" reads on quote attributed to Lincoln. The quote is untraceable to Lincoln and is often listed as an unconfirmed quote. ""It looks like that quote began appearing in various evangelical books attributing it to Lincoln at some point in the 1990s, but beyond that I don't know its origins,"" Lincoln scholar and Dickinson College professor Matthew Pinsker. ""It's certainly not Lincoln, or to be precise, there's no evidence that it comes from any of Lincoln's writings and no recollected account that I know of which even claims this line as his."" Another quote attributed to Lincoln in the book (""We are indeed, the almost chosen people"") seems to be a slight misread of an address Lincoln gave to the New Jersey legislature in February of 1861, where he is quoted by the New York Times as saying, ""I shall be most happy in lead if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, as the chosen instrument, also in the hands of the almighty, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle."" Huckabee and his co-author also attributed a quote to Samuel Adams (""without civility, there can be no society,"") that, upon searching, could only be found in his book and a 1999 column in a South Carolina newspaper written by a wedding consultant. Finally, a quote attributed to founding father Gouverneur Morris is not only a fake quote but a misattribution of a fake quote. ""The Constitution is not an instrument for government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government—lest it come to dominate our lives and interests,"" read the quote attributed to Morris. This quote is fake as noted by prominent historians, and is usually attributed to Patrick Henry. Andrew Kaczynski is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

http://theweek.com/speedreads/582008/stephen-colbert-finds-politician-more-verbally-maladroit-than-jeb-bush,"colbert nation Late Show Jeb Bush earned some pointed criticism for his ""stuff happens"" response to last week's mass shooting in Oregon, Stephen Colbert said on Wednesday's Late Show, and he largely deserved it. To give context, Colbert played the rest of the quote, where Bush said that after crises like the Oregon shooting, ""the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" ""That's leadership: Not necessarily doing anything,"" Colbert said, illustrating his point with an imagined dialogue: ""'Follow me, everyone!' 'Where are we going?' 'Right where we are.'"" Bush should be doing much better than 8 percent in the GOP polls, Colbert said, but ""when he says stuff like that, after 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, it sounds like he's got — how can I put this delicately? — stuff for brains."" But Bush isn't the only Republican vying for a position of power who has a hard time expressing himself, he added, turning to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the probable next House speaker. ""McCarthy's got plenty of support in Congress, so he's got the House part down,"" Colbert said, ""but apparently, he's still working on the 'speaker'."" After playing one garbled speech excerpt, he gravely lauded McCarthy's ""strong, English-like words."" After showcasing the future House speaker's verbal inabilities, Colbert showed all tongue-tied politicians how it's done. The music and waving flag help lend gravity to Colbert's incoherent speech, so maybe McCarthy should take note — well, that or hire a speaking coach.

http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/saunders/article/Shoot-first-ask-questions-later-6552196.php,"After America learned of the latest mass shooting at an Oregon community college, President Obama delivered remarks in which he lamented the loss of good, innocent people and then added, “Somehow this has become routine. ... We’ve become numb to this.” By the next day, Obama had a remedy: “Be a single-issue voter.” If you want to stop mass shootings, Obama argued, don’t vote for candidates who oppose federal background checks and “gun safety laws.” Nine adults who should be alive today are not, while the 26-year-old shooter got what he wanted — to leave this Earth in what he perceived as a blaze of glory. It is revolting to think how easy it is for some unhappy loser to leave a swath of destruction because he cannot make a life for himself in this world. The problem with guns is simple: Any idiot can kill others with them. Obama and other Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein would have you believe that they have an easy answer to this problem. Obama talked up proposed background checks as a remedy when he should have known the checks would have made no difference: The Oregon shooter had no criminal record, no restraining order against him, no involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The New York Times reported that the shooter brought five handguns and a rifle with him to Umpqua Community College — but left seven firearms at home. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman said the shooter and his family had 14 firearms in total — all purchased legally from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Feinstein sent out a statement: “After each shooting, I’ve been hopeful that Congress would act to close the gun-show loophole, mandate universal background checks and remove high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons from our streets.” Last week, the National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke asked the hosts and other guests on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” which specific proposals they believe could prevent another Roseburg. “This is not a competition to see who’s most vexed,” Cooke maintained, adding it is or at least it is supposed to be a public policy debate. Cooke was wrong: It is a contest about which side looks angrier. Co-host Mika Brzezinski jumped all over Cooke for not wanting to do more. Bloomberg Politics co-host Mark Halperin said: “We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity or how their side’s ideas aren’t good.” They offered no concrete ideas. In the gun debate, you often see people who would never buy a gun saying they support reasonable rules such as background checks, when what they really want to do is stop others from owning guns. The shooter’s father on CNN said he wanted Congress to pass “gun control” laws. He also said, “I’m a great believer: ‘You don’t buy guns, don’t buy guns, you don’t buy guns.’” That’s that sort of talk that prompts gun enthusiasts to buy more guns before Washington bans them. Ditto the Feinstein statement. So the question I would ask is: Is the idea to pass a law that makes supporters feel good, or is it prevent violence against innocents? Or is it about turning people into single-issue voters? Debra J. Saunders is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist. E-mail: dsaunders@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @DebraJSaunders Debra J.

http://blog.cleveland.com/letters/2015/10/second_amendment_letter_to_the_1.html,"In light of the latest irrational mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and the continual epidemic of gun violence in Cleveland and every other major city, I urge The Plain Dealer to reissue the call you made in 2012 after the Newtown, Conn., massacre for a ""far-ranging and fearless"" confrontation of the problem ""including the possible repeal or revision of the Second Amendment.""The uniqueness of the gun mayhem in our country is directly related to the unique presence of this amendment in our Constitution. This amendment is a dangerous anachronism. It was put in the Constitution by the Southern states not to protect freedom, but to protect slavery. Their representatives to the Constitutional Convention feared a federal monopoly on firearms as envisioned by the Constitution would enable the central government to shut down the slave patrol militias needed to maintain slavery. That's why the amendment cynically states: ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.""Repealing or revising the Second Amendment and limiting private gun ownership to hunting and legitimate self-defense would also go far to solving another serious problem -- the unwarranted and excessive use of gun violence by police, which is generally justified by the pervasive presence of guns in our communities. In most civilized countries, gun ownership is strictly regulated and police have far less or even no firepower on their daily patrols.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/116216549/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Voices-A-mass-murder-in-my-hometown/,"On Thursday afternoon last week, my attention was pulled away from my amassing inbox by the breaking news headline, “Officials: Shooting reported at Oregon Community College”. Not for a moment did I ever imagine that subsequent headlines would indicate the shooting took place in Roseburg, Ore. My community. Over the next 48 hours I could only listen and grieve, over 3,000 miles away in Washington, D.C, as the horrific details of the incident unfolded. As a nation, we’ve mourned the unspeakable tragedies that occurred in Charleston, Newtown, Columbine and so many other deeply wounded places. I don’t believe that anyone is immune to a certain degree of fear of what could happen, but knowing the area in which I grew up, that apprehension seemed too far-fetched to hold much weight. In less than an hour, I saw our small, unknown town splashed across the headlines of every media outlet with the words “tragedy” and “mass killing” attached to it. I sat in disbelief. This is not who we are.  You don’t walk the streets of Roseburg worrying about your safety. Sitting in my school classroom, enjoying a night at Music in the Park or strolling around the Douglas County fair, the notion that you could fall victim to violent crime was non-existent. Maybe even laughable. DES MOINES REGISTER Ten killed in shooting at Ore. community college To describe Roseburg as a community comprised of just those within its city limits does not provide an accurate picture. It’s truly an amalgamation of the immediate city and several smaller surrounding towns. Its geographic position in Douglas County is the perfect descriptor of its role. Roseburg is the center, the heart, of our rural area of southern Oregon. This intimately connected community is filled with some of the most hard-working and resilient people you could ever encounter. Over the last decade in our state, economic diversification has become critical to lessening the impact of the drastic decline of the timber industry. Many have endured incredible economic and financial hardships, but rather than collapsing under those hardships, they were determined to find a way to survive. I believe evidence of this is seen in the fact that the average age of students at Umpqua Community College, where the shootings took place, is just shy of 40.  UCC boasts an eclectic student body, but all share the common goal of acquiring necessary skills and education to better their position in the workforce and carve out a sustainable life for themselves. This embodiment of the American spirit permeates rural southern Oregon. Concern for the well-being of others is not merely some ideal that is given lip service. It can be seen and felt in the actions of this community, not only in the face of tragedy, but in the everyday as well. We love our city, our state and our country. We love God, and we love each other. Because of this, I’m not surprised by the accounts of heroism exhibited by numerous people during the attack. I’m not surprised to see the outpouring of emotional and financial support offered to grieving families, hospital staff, first responders and so many others. This is who we are. This is who we have always been. USA TODAY Obama to visit Roseburg Friday I believe many, in Roseburg and across the nation would strongly disagree with President Obama’s comment that we have become “numb” to this type of tragedy. On the contrary, we’ve seen communities that care deeply, that feel the impact of these tragedies immensely. Our hearts break for those who have lost loved ones, or now must cope with life-changing injuries. We are not people deprived of feeling and responsiveness. We feel. We hurt. We respond — with love, generosity and the Gospel of grace we strongly believe in. We are not numb. USA TODAY Rieder: Should the media ID mass killers? This is not a community keen to letting its voice be overridden by outside opinion, or that has any interest in becoming a soapbox for the political agenda of others. This community is not helpless, calling out to be rescued. We do not make impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. Once allowed the appropriate time to grieve, the necessary questions will be addressed. We will not be overcome by evil, by the actions of a darkly disturbed individual, or by the critical “told you so” rhetoric of those sponsoring a message of gun control. If there is one thing this community has learned through its countless trials and tribulations, it’s how to persevere. Its people will continue to move forward, putting one foot in front of the other, even if they’re limping in the process.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/YdbP5Gt8E_Y/," While many of President Obama’s critics were quick to jump all over him for admittedly politicizing the mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, GOP candidate Ben Carson chose to politicize it in his own weird way. Carson rolled eyes and raised brows when he wrote on his Facebook page that he “never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” People were obviously shocked and outraged over such a comment, but plenty of other people also raised their muskets in the air to celebrate the bold and occasionally clueless candidate’s words. Carson wasn’t done, though. In addition to his belief that stricter laws won’t stop killers from finding guns, Carson also offered a solution to these recurring mass shootings: “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” At least one survivor from the Umpqua incident was upset by Carson’s hypothetical bravery, telling CNN, “Nobody could truly understand what actions they would take like that in a situation unless they lived it.” But Carson has lived it, you see. Well, sort of, if you believe his latest story about why he’s qualified to be 2015’s Chuck Norris. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye’s organization” in Baltimore, the retired neurosurgeon told Karen Hunter on Sirius XM Radio, referring to the fried chicken fast-food chain. “Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, ‘I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.'” (Via CNN) Perhaps I need to consult with a brain surgeon, but that seems like the complete opposite of bravery.

High Bridge Arms, the only gun retailer within the city limit for the last 15 years, will be no more after Oct. 31. “There are multiple reasons. Ordinance is one factor,” said Russel Susbilla, an assistant manager at High Bridge. Susbilla is referring to San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell’s proposal to require all firearms sales to be videotaped and submission of records to the police of all ammunition sales, including online sales. That proposal is slated for a committee hearing in the next couple of weeks and could be signed into law by the end of the year if it secures enough support. High Bridge says it has made an effort to accommodate city demands, including installing a specific model of surveillance camera. But when the city came back and asked for additional cameras, High Bridge’s owner decided to call it quits, according to Susbilla. “The idea of the proposal is to be forward-looking,” said Jess Montejano, a legislative aide to Mark Farrell. “If Congress isn’t going to act [on tighter gun control], we will do everything possible to protect the public safety of our residents.” Montejano also scoffed at the idea that a policy that isn’t even in effect yet could cause the closure of the store. “It’s harassment,” said Delbert Wong, a customer at the store. Characterizing the move for additional surveillance of gun sales as a “liberal attitude,” Wong claimed that more gun control would not have stopped the mass shooting in Oregon that resulted in 10 deaths, including the shooter. The incident prompted Sens. Chuck Schumer--D-N.Y. and Debbie Stabenow--D-Mich. to propose additional regulations to expand background checks and prevent illegal gun purchases, according to reports. So far this year, there have been 298 mass shootings in the U.S., according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as one in which “four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling-off period.” For now, High Bridge has no plans to relocate. “People will have to drive out of the city to buy exactly the same thing [that they did here],” said John, a salesperson at the store who declined to give his last name.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/lnPsUr-Vujg/,"According to a recent blog post by Bobby Jindal, mass shootings have a number of causes, all centering in what he calls cultural decay: absent fathers, abortion, movies, and video games. With references to God's law, common decency, political correctness, and young boys who ""will never become real men"" because of a lack of truth in their lives, Jindal offers a baker's dozen of bullet points that he believes need repair in order to put an end to the killing. Jindal opens by warning readers that what follows ""will be a sermon,"" then proceeds to declare that the real reasons behind mass shootings are things that politicians refuse to discuss (such as abortion, apparently).  He begins to list them, and though some of his 13 bullet points are a bit redundant, they can be condensed to the following:  As for abortion, that is, of course, a key talking point for all presidential candidates at the moment, as the controversy continues over the Planned Parenthood videos and threats by some politicians to shut down the government over funding of the organization. However, other than declaring a lack of value for the sanctity of life, Jindal doesn't go into further detail about how he believes abortion and mass shootings are connected. He also offers no explanation for his assertion that there is a lack of care for elderly lives, though that could perhaps be linked to long-debunked (Snopes covers this here) claims of death panels and ethics boards connected to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Lack of father figures is a particular key point for the Republican presidential hopeful. It conveniently ties in to the GOP ""family values"" talking point, and allows for the attack on males who aren't ""real men."" He declares that most of these mass shootings are carried out by individuals who either have no father figure in their lives, or who have a poor relationship with their fathers. In fact, the most recent mass murder to make major headlines is directly connected to this point, in Jindal's view. In his final four bullet points, Bobby Jindal focuses on the recent mass shooting in Oregon, declaring that the shooter's father, who ""..is now lecturing us on the need for gun control."" Turning the narrative around, Jindal points out that the father said he hadn't spoken with his son in a while, and that he didn't know his son owned guns.  Bobby Jindal's declaration on the causes of mass shootings is getting largely negative feedback, with tweets from followers who say that the real ""cultural rot"" is rooted in bigotry, racism, the gun lobby, and low availability of medical care, including mental health care, for Americans living below the poverty line.

The Kind Soul of Clarence Thomas The Two Countercultures Clarence Thomas, an American Justice There’s the cycle of poverty. There’s the cycle of violence. And then there’s the cycle of gun talk. It starts with a mass shooting. Gun-control advocates blame the deaths on gun-control opponents, who argue, in turn, that none of the proposed restrictions would have had any effect on the incident in question. The debate goes nowhere. The media move on. Until the next incident, when the cycle begins again. So with the Roseburg massacre in Oregon. Within hours, President Obama takes to the microphones to furiously denounce the NRA and its ilk for resisting “commonsense gun-safety laws.” His harangue is totally sincere, totally knee-jerk, and totally pointless. At the time he delivers it, he — and we — know practically nothing about the shooter, nothing about the weapons, nothing about how they were obtained. Nor does Obama propose any legislation. He knows none would pass. But the deeper truth is that it would have made no difference. Does anyone really believe that the (alleged) gun-show loophole had anything to do with Roseburg? Universal background checks sound wonderful. But Oregon already has one. The Roseburg shooter and his mother obtained every one of their guns legally. RELATED: Hillary & Co. Fight a Phony War on Gun Violence The reason the debate is so muddled, indeed surreal — notice, by the way, how “gun control” has been cleverly rechristened “commonsense gun-safety laws,” as if we’re talking about accident proofing — is that both sides know that the only measure that might actually prevent mass killings has absolutely no chance of ever being enacted. Mere “commonsense” regulation, like the assault-weapons ban of 1994 that was allowed to lapse ten years later, does little more than make us feel good. A Justice Department study found “no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.” #share#As for the only remotely plausible solution, Obama dare not speak its name. He made an oblique reference to Australia, never mentioning that its gun-control innovation was confiscation, by means of a mandatory buyback. There’s a reason he didn’t bring up confiscation (apart from the debate about its actual efficacy in reducing gun violence in Australia). In this country, with its traditions, public sentiment, and — most importantly — Second Amendment, them’s fightin’ words. Obama didn’t say them. Nor did he seriously address the other approach that could make a difference: more-aggressive psychiatric intervention. These massacres are almost invariably perpetrated by severely disturbed, isolated, often delusional young men. RELATED: For Obama Gun Control Is About the Issue Not the Solution Yet even here, our reach is limited. In some cases, yes, involuntary commitment would have made a difference. Jared Loughner, the Tucson shooter, was so unstable, so menacing, that fellow students at his community college feared, said one, that he would “come into class with an automatic weapon.” Under our crazy laws, however, he had to kill before he could be locked up. If President Obama believes in Australian-style confiscation, why not spell it out? Similarly, the Navy Yard shooter had been found by police a few weeks earlier in a hotel room, psychotic and paranoid. They advised him to get psychiatric help. Advised. Predictably, he fell through the mental-health cracks. A month later, he killed twelve and was killed himself, another casualty of a mental-health system that lets the severely psychiatrically ill — you see them sleeping on grates — live and die wretchedly abandoned. The problem is that these mass-murder cases are fairly unusual. Take Roseburg. That young man had no criminal history, no psychiatric diagnosis beyond Asperger’s, no involvement in public disturbances. How do you find, let alone lock up, someone like that? There are 320 million Americans. Schizophrenia affects about 1 percent of the population. That’s about 3 million people. Only a tiny fraction are ever violent — and predicting which ones will be is almost impossible. #related#Loner, socially isolated, often immersed in a fantasy world of violent video games. There are myriad such young men out there, but with different ages of onset, in different stages of derangement. Only a handful will ever harm anyone. What to do? Forcibly apprehend them, treat them, put them on perpetual preventive parole? By the tens of thousands? Committing the Jared Loughners would have an effect. But even they are the exception among the shooters. Yet “commonsense” gun control would do even less. Unless you’re willing to go all the way. In the final quarter of his presidency, Obama can very well say what he wants. If he believes in Australian-style confiscation — i.e., abolishing the Second Amendment — why not spell it out? Until he does, he should stop demonizing people for not doing what he won’t even propose. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2481768/highland-high-school-shooting-nude-pics/,"Less than one week after a horrifying mass shooting that killed 10 at a community college in Oregon, a high school in Idaho may have narrowly averted a similar tragedy, arresting a 15-year-old student who posted frightening online threats to carry out a mass shooting at the school — a student who, though he has not been named publicly by police, reportedly had a history harassing other students via social media posts. The incident caused police in Pocatello, Idaho, to place Highland High School there on lockdown for much of Wednesday, until the teen was identified and taken into custody. The school was able to resume normal operation on Thursday. Another student at Highland High School described the teen accused of making the violent and disturbing mass shooting threats as ""having attention problems."" The incident apparently began with a Facebook post that included a screen shot of what appeared to be a text message conversation on a smartphone. The text messages contained threats by one of the participants, apparently a high school student, to ""bring a gun to school and kill all the girls.""   The student in the text message went on to detail how he planned to carry out the school shooting. ""I've got this figured out,"" he wrote. ""I will start in upper b hall, work to lower b halls. I will then so the attendance office c hall. Then e building enter the back the other c hall then finish in the weight rooms."" The other teen in the bizarre and chilling text exchange seemed to know the motivation of the threatened shooter, replying, ""Over freaking nudes? Dude."" Interviewed by KPVI-TV in Pocatello, another student, Isaac Gomez, explained that the student making the threats was angry that school cheerleaders would not share nude pictures of themselves with him. ""Some kid who was having attention problems with some of the like, specifically some of the cheerleaders, didn't get, like, nudes,"" Gomez said. ""He was asking for some inappropriate things.""   In the text messages, the teen wrote of his anger at the girls' refusal to show him nude pictures of themselves. ""Because no one will give any to me,"" he wrote. ""Everyone hates me. and I hate [name obscured]. Also I will kill myself after. I hope everyone has a will written."" In other text messages attributed to the teen, he claimed to own ""a 12 gauge shotgun and 9mm pistol I will bring and start killing everyone."" Pocatello/Chubbuck School District No. 25 public relations specialist Shelley Allen said that the school will ""always overprotect"" in cases where potential threats are made against district schools. Whether or not the student actually owned the firearms claimed in the text message exchange, or if they have determined whether he intended to carry out the threats of violence, has not been confirmed by police in Pocatello. But according to a report in the Idaho State Journal newspaper, the same 15-year-old boy used his Twitter account to harass numerous Highland High School students, most of them girls. In another tweet, the teen made threats of violence against United States President Barack Obama, and yet another of his objectionable Twitter posts contained racist language referring to African-Americans. School officials said that the school also received an anonymous phone call on Wednesday as well, but would not say what the content of that phone call might have been. During the Highland High School lockdown, all classroom doors were locked and access in and out of the building was restricted to one set of doors only. The teen suspect was charged with one count of telephone harassment, and one count of making a violent threat against a school. He is being held in a juvenile detention center in the area.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2481698/spencer-stone-update-police-seek-men-who-repeatedly-stabbed-train-terrorist-attack-hero/,"Spencer Stone remains in serious condition after assailants attacked and repeatedly stabbed the hero who stopped a terrorist attack on a train this summer, and now police are looking for help in finding the men who carried out the bloody attack. Police in Sacramento said that the U.S. Airman was stabbed numerous times in an attack that took place Wednesday night. A spokesman for U.C. Davis Medical Center said that Stone had been stabbed in the torso three times, and was expected to make a full recovery, ABC 10 reported. While Stone recovers from his injuries, police are on the hunt for two or three Asian males who were seen fleeing the scene of the attack in a 2009 to 2012 dark gray or black Toyota Camry. Authorities say the attack stemmed from a nightclub incident, which spilled out into an altercation near 21st and K Streets. Surveillance video captured the attack and stabbing of Spencer Stone, though police said the footage was too grainy to make out faces. Stone gained fame this summer when he, along with four other men, stopped a gunman who was trying to attack passengers on a train headed from Amsterdam to Paris. Stone rushed the gunman and was stabbed several times in the process, including one slash that nearly took off his thumb, CNN noted. It was Stone who first attacked the gunman, with the other men saying he put himself at the most risk in order to help save the others on the train. ""If anybody would have gotten shot, it would have been Spencer for sure, and we're very lucky that nobody got killed, especially Spencer,"" said Alek Skarlatos. But even after suffering the slash wounds, Stone managed to give aid to another man whose throat was cut. Stone applied pressure to the cut, ultimately saving the man's life.

We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. Everything in that statement is wrong. What happened in Oregon is tragic, and the nation should comfort families and look for reasonable and practical ways to stem violence, but there is only one murderer. Now, if government somehow bolstered, endorsed, or “allowed” the actions of Chris Harper-Mercer — as it might with, say, the deaths of 10,000-plus viable babies each year or the civilian deaths that occur during an American drone action — a person could plausibly argue that we are collectively answerable as a nation. Then again, when the president asserts that Americans are collectively answerable, what he really suggests — according to his own broader argument — is that conservatives who’ve blocked his gun-control legislation are wholly responsible. The problem with that contention, outside of the obvious fact that Republicans never condone the use of guns for illegal violence (in fact, these rampages hurt their cause more than anything), is that Democrats haven’t offered a single bill or idea (short of confiscation) that would impede any of the mass shootings or overall gun violence. This is not a political choice, because it’s likely there is no available political answer. The Left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills — because no person can be evil. For the liberal, every societal problem has a state-issued remedy waiting to be administered over the objections of a reactionary Republican. But just because you have a tremendous amount of emotion and frustration built up around a certain cause doesn’t make your favored legislation any more practical, effective, or realistic. It doesn’t change the fact that owning a gun is a civil right, that the preponderance of owners are not criminals, or that there are 300 million guns out there. And if it’s a political argument you’re offering — and when hasn’t it been? — you’ll need more than the vacuousness of “this is bad, so we have to do something.” That’s because anti-gun types are never able to answer a simple question: What law would you pass that could stop these shootings? Many liberals see the Second Amendment as tragically misinterpreted or useless and guns as abhorrent, so they do not believe that any legislative imposition is a trade-off — even an ineffective law. Many conservatives view guns as a civil right, so this is an unacceptable trade-off. Some don’t even view mass shooting as primarily a gun problem. Now, that doesn’t mean guns have nothing to do with it, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it well responding to a Slate piece: One can simultaneously believe that the high volume of firearms contributes to our high homicide rate and that these laws aren’t good ideas. It’s actually pretty easy to believe both of these things at once, since none of the regulations at issue would do much at all to reduce our high volume of firearms. Jeb Bush took a lot of heat for asserting that “stuff happens” (out of context). Now, horrific stuff happens, and we should do what we can, balanced with a host of other concerns, to stop these shootings. But it’s worth pointing out that less stuff has been happening. Despite all the Obama administration’s fear-mongering and as horrifying as any shooting is, gun violence has precipitously declined over the decades without any meaningful federal law being enacted. This most likely tells us there are a number of other social currents driving this kind of violence. The Left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills — because no person can be evil. So the debate takes on the same old contours, and we focus on firearms and nothing else. That kind of political debate only makes it less likely that anything good will happen. When we politicize a tragedy, it is immediately sucked into a broader ideological conflict. Then conservatives (at least when out of power) will see (rightfully, I believe) an intrusive agenda that is a perpetual slippery slope. (Can you blame them when they hear this? “No, we don’t want confiscation, but look at what the Australians did! They confiscated guns. We don’t want confiscation, but isn’t that Second Amendment interpretation so stupid?!”) Trust me, it’s not unreasonable to treat liberal policies as if they have a tendency for mission creep and unwieldy expansion.

        Mark Arce Posted on October 8, 2015, at 5:36 p.m. ET Ben Carson says he is ""very glad"" his comments in the aftermath of the shooting in Oregon about attacking the shooter have started a conversation about the appropriate way to react during a mass shooting. The former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate has been criticized in the past week for telling Fox News that if he had been at the shooting he would have attacked the gunman to prevent him from killing more people. ""Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson said on Fox. ""I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Responding on Wednesday to the controversy over his comments, Carson said he thought the ""sacrifice"" of those in Oregon might be what triggers what he called an ""appropriate response"" next time to prevent less death. ""I'm very glad to be able to inspire a conversation about what people should do when they get in these situations, not a criticism of people who've been in the situation before,"" Carson told radio host Lars Larson. ""In fact, you know, their sacrifice may be the thing that will trigger an appropriate response the next time so that not as many people will be killed."" Carson cited Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers fought back against al-Qaeda hijackers. ""I believe that's the case and remember with, you know, Flight 93 over Pennsylvania. You know, they decided that, you know, if they were going to go down, you know, they were going to go down trying and I believe that if, you know, you don't really see hijacking situations anymore, but if you did see one I think you'd see a lot of passengers get up and attack the person,"" stated Carson. LARS LARSON: You're in the middle of what the media likes to call a controversy, but I didn't think that you're remarks were that controversial. It concerned the shooting at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon about a week ago now as we're doing this interview, in which you were asked, 'what you would've done had you been in that situation' and people I guess have twisted this to say Dr. Carson is criticizing anybody who didn't fight back against this gunman.BEN CARSON: Which is absolutely absurd, but of course that's the world that we live in now. People don't actually listen to what's being said, they look for a way that they can twist it to create controversy and wars between people. And instead of setting up warfare between people we should be using our collective intellect to figure out how do we solve these problems. And I'm very glad to be able to inspire a conversation about what people should do when they get in these situations, not a criticism of people who've been in the situation before. In fact, you know, their sacrifice may be the thing that will trigger an appropriate response the next time so that not as many people will be killed.LL: Well in fact I had the thought as I was seeing this made up controversy, cause I really think it is a made up controversy Doc, because I've had people ask me, 'what would you do' and I would say, 'well, this is what I would do' and they'd say 'are you criticizing someone that doesn't do that?' I say, 'no, you asked me what I would do.' When you said 'I would ask everyone to attack the gunman because he could only shot one of us at a time. That way we don't all wind up dead.' If that comment sticks in the minds in millions of Americans - and your words do seem to stick in minds and we can tell that from the polls - I would imagine that someday that if someone finds themselves in a situation like this they might think, 'this guy can't shoot us all at once. Let's, you know, let's yell at him and all run at him at once but it has to be done quickly.' I think you're words might just save a few lives. BC: I believe that's the case and remember with, you know, Flight 93 over Pennsylvania. You know, they decided that, you know, if they were going to go down, you know, they were going to go down trying and I believe that if, you know, you don't really see hijacking situations anymore, but if you did see one I think you'd see a lot of passengers get up and attack the person.

http://www.chron.com/opinion/letters/article/Friday-letters-Seeking-solutions-about-gun-6559754.php,"Don't just sit! Regarding ""Ben Carson's advice on mass shooting under scrutiny"" (HoustonChronicle.com, Thursday), Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is taking heat for suggesting that victims, such as those in Oregon, not sit there and get shot but rather do something to keep from being shot. I entirely agree! I am a recently retired teacher from the Houston Independent School District. Right after Columbine happened, I told my students that this practice of shooting students was going to catch on. Someone finally figured out that targets are lined up, unaware and unarmed. I then gave them a quick briefing on what to do called ""In case a nut comes through the door with guns blazing"" drill. I told them what steps they could take to ""lower the body count"" and impressed upon them the need for speed (""You have less than half a second to act and it will be over in 5 seconds!"") For the most part, they listened. Tell it Carson. Tell it! Mike Lopez, Houston Mental illness Regarding ""The unimaginable keeps happening, and we have to make it stop"" by columnist Lisa Falkenberg, (Page B1, Sunday""), mental health issues play a large part in these shootings. There is a shortage of psychiatrists, mental hospitals, patient beds, programs, you name it. Also, once a person becomes an adult, the parents, family, friends become nearly helpless to intervene. Late teens, early adulthood is often when mental illness shows its ugly head. Therese Perez, Houston Criminals Lisa Falkenberg makes some valid points as well as many of letters to the editor. One admitted that criminals and gang members are going to get guns anyway, but tighter regulations on guns may stop an unstable person from going postal. However, that accounts for less than 1 percent of gun deaths, yet demands 99 percent of the attention - which isn't very sensible or reasonable. And like another writer said, criminals are attracted to gun-free zones like pedophiles are to playgrounds. Charles Westmoreland, Houston Driving Regarding ""Unsafe zones"" (Page B6, Wednesday), the letter writer seems to compare deaths caused by automobile crashes to deaths caused by guns. There is one big difference. Cars were not designed to kill people. Guns, especially handguns and automatic weapons, were designed for that sole purpose. If there is any comparison, it should be in the regulation of these two dissimilar items. By law, I must register my car. There are laws which prevent me from allowing under-aged children or my blind father-in-law from driving my car. Yet even though the opening words of the Second Amendment are ""A well-regulated militia...,"" we do hardly anything to regulate these instruments of death. It seems guns will always be with us.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/116264429/0/phoenix/nation~Don%e2%80%99t-give-killers-what-they-want-Opposing-view/,"Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin’s decision not to name the perpetrator of the recent mass shooting in Oregon has created a national conversation about how these events should be covered — a conversation that’s long overdue. As director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, a founder of the Don’t Name Them campaign, and a researcher of these events, I believe there are three primary reasons that a shooter should only be named a single time, if at all. USA TODAY #NoNotoriety has a downside: Our view We now have empirical evidence that the contagion effect operates in mass shootings. When a mass shooting is widely covered, there’s an increased chance that another mass shooting will occur shortly after the first. This “contagion” effect has been well documented in the suicide literature, and the news media have taken the responsible position of not widely publicizing suicides. Evidence of contagion is clear in the Oregon shooting. The attacker referenced the recent murders of Roanoke, Va., reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward, and the notoriety their killer amassed. Second, one of the principles of situational crime prevention is that if you reduce the reward for committing a crime, you reduce the occurrence of the crime. The Oregon shooter clearly sought recognition. He went so far as to say, “The more people you kill, the more you are in the limelight.” If we know that one motivation for many attackers is a desire for notoriety, why would we give them what they want? Doing so only rewards them for their crime and encourages other potential attackers. The same applies to publishing and distributing their manifestos or videos. Members of the Don’t Name Them and No Notoriety campaigns believe society should not reward criminal behavior in any way. Finally, focusing on the shooter further victimizes the families of those killed. Having to see the shooter over and over is a constant reminder of their loss. Focusing on the shooter also devalues the lives of the victims. We should focus on the victims and heroes. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, is director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center."

The debate goes nowhere. The media move on. Until the next incident, when the cycle begins again. So with the Roseburg massacre in Oregon. Within hours, President Obama takes to the microphones to furiously denounce the National Rifle Association and its ilk for resisting “common-sense gun-safety laws.” His harangue is totally sincere, totally knee-jerk and totally pointless. At the time he delivers it, he — and we — know practically nothing about the shooter, nothing about the weapons, nothing about how they were obtained."

And the politician’s recollection of a past memory may keep him in the same spot. Chatting with Sirius XM Radio host Karen Hunter, Carson shared a story of his reaction when a gun was pulled on him at Popeye’s, CNN reports. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye’s organization,” he told Hunter Wednesday (Oct. 7). “Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, ‘I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.’” The years since the incident apparently have had particular effect on Carson as his reaction to the Popeye’s gunman differs from the strategy he advocated when discussing the Oregon shooting. “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me but he can’t get us all,’” the GOP presidential hopeful said during an interview on Fox and Friends. Since news surfaced of Carson’s comments about the Oregon shooting, many have labeled him insensitive. Among those criticizing the retired neurosurgeon is Mathew Downing, a survivor of the shooting. In his eyes, Carson’s couldn’t capture what people were thinking at the time of the shooting unless he was among those experiencing what happened first hand. “I’m fairly upset he said that,” Downing told CNN. “Nobody could truly understand what actions they would take like that in a situation unless they lived it.” For Carson’s interview with Hunter, check out the video below:  I agree with Carson. Why didn’t he rush the gunman in Popeyes? What exactly do you agree with, I said it? This?, is a lyin hypocrite muthaFKaaaaah! And I ask?…..is “this” the example Christ exemplifies, in his teachings??….to offer someELSE’s life & “NOT” sacrifice your own??!! I mean reeeeeally Uncle Ben?, reeeeeally??? Oh puuuLEEZE STFU you fake ass Christian/authentic/FULL fledged ass kissin Sambo. WASMGDHATSAN! Ben Carson is saying just what he needs to say in the primaries. The media makes a big “controversy” about something he says every other day, yet instead of anything he says harming his campaign, Ben Carson rises in the polls and his campaign dollars increase significantly. .no big mystery here folk..Ben Carson is saying just what the idiot GOP voter’s believe..he will never get the GOP nom because the GOP knows his appeal does not extend outside the party and he will crash and burn in the General. Naaaaaaw he MEANS this shyt! JUSt as Messy Jesse did “HIS” self hate’en massa ass kissin BS!!

http://www.inquisitr.com/2481666/shoplifter-shot-at-while-fleeing-home-depot-expert-says-not-justified/,"  Following the alleged shoplifting incident and subsequent shooting, the Auburn Hills Police Department sent out a tweet asking for the public's help locating the suspects. However, despite the police department's concern over finding the alleged shoplifter, the public was more concerned about the ""reckless"" actions of the gun-wielding vigilante. Even concealed weapons permit instructors are up in arms about her decision to discharge her firearm in a busy shopping center.    The shooter, who repeatedly discharged her weapon, angered customers, locals, and concealed carry instructors alike. There are very clear laws and regulations in place which dictate when it's appropriate to fire a shot at another person. First and foremost, you should never fire a shot unless you're in imminent danger. The consensus among experts is that going vigilante on a shoplifter who is fleeing the scene definitely doesn't qualify. The Detroit Free Press reports that the 48-year old woman who shot at the shoplifter was never in any danger. Indeed, it's almost never legal to fire a shot at a shoplifter, particularly when you're simply defending against the loss of property.   It was apparent to witnesses that the concealed pistol permit holder who shot at the shoplifter was unaware of everything that had led up to the man's attempted escape. The Home Depot is also part of a very crowded retail shopping area, and there were dozens of other people in the direct vicinity of the shots fired. The fact that she was only able to (possibly) hit the SUV with a single shot after having fired several times at the shoplifter indicates that a bystander could easily have been hit by a wayward bullet. Thankfully, no one was injured, however, the situation could have been deadly for anyone in the area. It's also important to recognize that while being a shoplifter is illegal, it doesn't warrant being shot. Theft of property is not a capital crime, and every accused shoplifter is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  Today, Americans are reeling in the wake of yet another college shooting, which took place in Arizona. This most recent shooting was the result of an argument between two different groups of Northern Arizona University students (reportedly fraternity members). The altercation escalated into violence, with one student ultimately shooting four others. One of the victims in this case lost his life, while three other victims are currently being treated in Flagstaff, reports ABC News. In this most recent case of college students being shot on campus, the shooter has been identified as 18-year-old Steven Jones, a freshman.  The Northern Arizona University shooting, which has spawned the hashtag #prayfornau, took place just over a week since the Oregon mass shooting, the same day that President Obama is scheduled to visit Roseburg and less than three days after an alleged shoplifter was shot at in a Home Depot parking lot.

Every Monday President Obama travels to Roseburg, Ore., on Friday to comfort families of last week's massacre victims. Democrats are getting bolder on gun violence. Loading... October 9, 2015 The politics of gun violence has turned a corner. Following last week’s mass shooting at a college campus in Roseburg, Ore., Democrats in Congress are back on the offensive against gun violence. In the presidential race, Hillary Clinton has made gun safety proposals a centerpiece of her campaign, while Republican candidates bend over backward – at times in eyebrow-raising fashion – to defend gun owners’ rights. And on Friday, President Obama heads to Roseburg to meet with the families of victims. It will be a low-key visit, with no public announcements planned. Roseburg is in a conservative part of Oregon, and the president may hear more jeers than cheers from local residents. Thousands plan to protest the visit. But Obama is pressing on, fulfilling his pledge to keep speaking out on gun violence. The bottom line on guns and politics is this: Unlike in the 2008 and 2012 election cycles, when Mr. Obama shied away from a focus on guns, Democrats have made it a top issue in the 2016 cycle. “It’s still early, but I think among Democrats, there’s a stronger sense that this issue is worthy of pushing and might have some electoral traction, including in the general electorate,” says Robert Spitzer, an expert on the politics of guns at the State University of New York in Cortland. The growing frequency of public mass shootings is driving the discussion. But the tragic headlines aren’t the only reason some politicians are more willing to stick their necks out, in defiance of the powerful gun lobby. The political calculation has changed in three other ways: • Most Democrats on Capitol Hill seem to have nothing to lose. Time was when the Democrats had a significant cohort in Congress representing pro-gun states and districts, and needed to avoid antagonizing the National Rifle Association. But many of those Democrats are now gone. Some retired and were replaced by Republicans; others lost reelection. The result is more uniformity of views in each party conference – and more polarization. That makes the prospects for passing legislation anytime soon virtually nil. Still, Senate Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a new gun control proposal, aimed at improving background checks and closing gun-purchase loopholes. It’s a response to Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s summer proposal to focus on the mental health of would-be gun buyers. Supporters of comprehensive legislation, combining elements of both ideas, are skeptical that the climate is right for a bipartisan approach. But at least the conversation is alive. And Democrats, now in the minority across Capitol Hill, have less reason to hold back. Polls show strong bipartisan support for a stronger background check system. • Mrs. Clinton sees a rare political opening to the left of Bernie Sanders – and a breakout moment for Democrats. Senator Sanders, Clinton’s top opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, represents Vermont, a rural hunting state. As such, he has not been vocal on firearms – a departure from the liberal passion that otherwise defines his platform. Sanders’ voting record, in fact, is mixed on guns – a “no” on the 1993 Brady Bill (requiring background checks) but then a “yes” in 2013 on legislation to expand background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. In his 2012 reelection, Sanders rated a D- from the National Rifle Association. This is not to say that many Sanders supporters are likely to leave him for Clinton over guns. More important for Clinton, in fact, is what the issue does to her image among the larger electorate. Her sweeping new gun control proposal, introduced Monday, represents a major break with her party’s efforts to woo gun owners – and with her own posture as a candidate in 2008, when she did not emphasize gun control. On Monday, an emotional Clinton called for closing the so-called “gun show loophole” on private weapon sales, and repeal of a law that bars victims of gun violence from suing gun manufacturers. She also proposed closing another loophole that allows for gun purchases to proceed even if the federal background check isn’t completed after three days. To reach beyond their base, though, Democrats have work to do, says Daniel Webster, Director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. “Candidates are going to have to find a way to engage the mainstream gun owner, who generally favors background checks and other measures to keep guns away from dangerous people, and do it in a way that’s respectful,” says Mr. Webster. Meanwhile, some Republican presidential candidates haven’t done themselves any favors in their reactions to Roseburg. Jeb Bush appeared insensitive when he said “stuff happens.” Ben Carson came close to blaming the victims when he said, “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me.” • Obama is a lame duck, and gun violence is a legacy issue for him. Obama has called his inability to pass new gun control laws the greatest frustration of his presidency. Now well past his last election as president, Obama is liberated, in a way, in both his use of the bully pulpit and his aggressive use of executive authority. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. The ability of presidents to sway public opinion – and thus Congress – is often overrated, but for Obama, there may be nothing to lose. Few issues get the cool Obama as emotional as gun violence, especially when its victims are young. Obama is also exploring new executive actions on guns, even after saying he had exhausted that avenue following the December 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. One possibility is to redefine private gun dealers as being “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, thus requiring their buyers to undergo background checks. Already a subscriber?

The stars of the excellent new drama Truth, about the Killian documents controversy and subsequent resignation of Dan Rather, sat down to discuss the film and its timeless message. Senior Entertainment Editor One of the best films I had the pleasure of seeing at this year’s Toronto Film Festival is Truth. Directed by James Vanderbilt and adapted from former 60 Minutes producer Mary Mapes’s 2005 memoir Truth and Duty: The Press, The President, and The Privilege of Power, the film reexamines the controversial 60 Minutes story questioning George W. Bush’s service record in the Air National Guard—heretofore known as the “Killian documents controversy” or “Rathergate.” In the months prior to the 2004 presidential election, Dan Rather (Robert Redford) and his longtime producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) sought to confirm rumors that Bush had received preferential treatment while serving in the Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. As part of the evidence in their story, they focused on three memoranda allegedly authored by Bush’s commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, who’d passed away years ago. The 60 Minutes segment aired on September 8, 2004, but when the documents were proven to be false, the fallout was huge. Rather, the longtime CBS News anchor, was pressured into an early resignation, and Mapes was dragged before a review panel—co-chaired by Dick Thornburgh, U.S. Attorney General under George H.W. Bush—interrogated at length, and then fired. The entire saga is captured in thrilling fashion in Truth, which boasts award-worthy turns from Blanchett as the embattled Mapes and Redford as the steady Rather. It opens on October 16.   The Daily Beast sat down with Blanchett and Redford in New York for a wide-ranging conversation about George W. Bush, America’s mass shooting problem, and more. We’ve just had yet another mass shooting in Oregon, and Cate, your home country of Australia is in a lot of ways the model for gun control—since, following the 1996 Port Arthur Massacre, Prime Minister John Howard enacted very strict gun control, and there have been few mass shootings there since. Cate Blanchett: Doesn’t it have to do with the relationship this country has with its Founding Fathers and its Constitution? We’re trying to get changes to our Constitution to finally recognize indigenous Australians who were classified until 1969 as part of “flora and fauna.” We want to finally get constitutional recognition of them and it’s very difficult for a government to open the door to change the Constitution. But it seems profoundly impossible for this country to reassess that amendment that deals with the right to bear arms. Robert Redford: I think when you get to the core of American life, it has to do with independence. We were a country founded on independence—we wanted to break away from England—so we were going to have our own rules and our own laws, and guns made that possible. And we needed guns to fight the British, fight the Indians, and all that. So that just sticks. And somehow, I think guns have become a symbol of our independence and they don’t want to give it up. They see it as an unalienable right that they don’t want to give up, and the NRA moves on it, and just uses that. But I think it’s really, really sad.It does seem to be an American problem. When you look at a country with few guns like Japan, there aren’t mass shootings. There’s the occasional mass stabbing, but stabbing someone is a far more intimate act than hiding behind the barrel of a gun. Blanchett: It’s also analyzing just how many kids in schools in America are on medication and the FDA and the amount of corn syrup in food, and what that does. There’s a whole intersection of issues apart from guns themselves. Certainly I know my children get nervous about the idea of coming here and going into school, but yeah, it’s an issue. Redford: I’m obviously very pro-nature. Art and nature, those two things come together for me. I remember raising my kids in New York when they were little, because I was in the theater. I had a place out West, this cabin in the mountains. I wanted to be completely free of any civilized stuff, and I wanted my kids to understand both worlds. I hunted in those early years because I started when I was a kid. We were sleeping outside in sleeping bags and I woke up one morning and the two kids I had at that time were there. I looked up and there was a deer that put its nose down at the foot of one of my children’s sleeping bags. I said, “That’s it.” When I saw that and I saw their reaction to it, I put the two together and said, “That’s it. There’s no more hunting. It’s over.” It’s interesting. The film Truth is very much about journalism, and the importance of getting a story completely right. Take for example The New York Times and the Iraq War—we’ve had so many stories in this day and age crumble, and the consequences have been catastrophic. Redford: That’s right. I think a lot of that has to do with the competition. The competition’s gotten so strong because there are so many voices out there, and it’s forced people who are in the lead like The New York Times to maybe rush it a little bit, and then they might stumble. Blanchett: But in the country I live in [Australia], we have such a centralization of media ownership that in a way we don’t have enough outlets. So it’s a balance, isn’t it?  Let’s say the Killian documents were actually real and this story was done properly. This story could have had major ramifications and swung the 2004 election in Kerry’s favor. Blanchett: But could that have happened in September 2004? If Mary and Dan made a mistake, they underestimated the toxicity of the political atmosphere—and it was explosive whichever way it fell out. I hope that the film is presenting all the characters warts and all, but what it does point to is that the story very quickly got lost in the details. In a way, you can pick anything apart. There’s an interesting scene in the film where Mary says, “The documents are a very small part of the story,” but what happened was the horse had bolted, and because the story was rushed then they were open to criticism. Redford: Now, they can take a small thing and enflame it on the other side. I think Dan and Mary probably underestimated the degree and the lengths that the other side would go to discredit the story. I think they were doing the best they could. They certainly knew they were going to be against the odds and knew what they were going after was going to create repercussions, but I don’t think they underestimated the degree, detail, and lengths the other side would go to discredit them. Rather describes in his book how a Viacom lobbyist was on record stating that they tried to influence the story, and the fallout. Blanchett: Well, Sumner [Redstone] is saying, “I vote for Viacom.” But that’s part of the atmosphere. The interesting thing is they’re guilty of rushing. What journalist doesn’t want to break the story first? Where do you two fall on the subject of George W. Bush’s service in the Air National Guard? It does seem quite fishy. Blanchett: Mary was accused of obsessively chasing the Bush/Guard story, but she lived in Texas, which she describes in the book hilariously as “the intergalactic capital of shit happens.” It’s such a great definition. If you’re going to report on politics, it’s the perfect place, and it really did balance out the East Coast-centric reporting on politics. But she had known of the story like a lot of journalists in Texas—that there had long been a question mark over Bush’s service—and the piece didn’t say it definitively, it just said, “We are raising these questions.” She got [General] Hodges to say it on the phone—and she still kicks herself to this day that she didn’t press “record”—but journalists write stories with unnamed sources, so they weren’t doing anything unusual. Redford: How were they motivated? Maybe they were motivated by something that happened earlier that never got treated right, which was 9/11 and Bush and Cheney and Wolfowitz. What those guys did with Iraq we now know was pretty criminal. [Rather and Mapes] knew it, but the other side was successful in sliding past that. Maybe down deep somewhere was the motivation to write something and use it to right a wrong. Rather and Mapes did screw up the story, though, and the bogus documents aside, did a lot of other things that were journalistically questionable—like producing all of the follow-up segments defending their work themselves. Redford: It’s good that the film brings up that it was not flawless, their behavior, but it was motivated by speed and desire. With the election, they had to move quickly to have the full benefit of the story. One of the things I like about the script is that it points out those flaws—it’s not totally one-sided. I know all presidents get a higher approval rating once they leave office, but how do you feel about George W. Bush having a positive approval rating post-presidency? It seems like a bizarre slice of revisionist history. Now, he’s being portrayed as this eccentric painter. Redford: It’s insane. So much so that he’s going to be a benefit to his brother [Jeb], right? He’s changed the subject and been this down-home guy in Texas, and they forgot about the Iraq War and forgot about all the lies and so forth. Maybe we have a short attention span. But I’m with you on that one. Have we really forgotten the damage that Bush caused? But stories like this begin to hack at it and chip away at it. Blanchett: I’ll never forget that moment with the second inauguration [of Bush] where, for the first time in American history, the cavalcade up to the White House was completely closed black cars. It was one of the most sinister things I’ve ever seen in my life."

Every Monday Indiscriminate rampages get a lot of national attention, but they only account for a very small percentage of gun deaths. Loading... October 9, 2015 When a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., last week, he seemed intent on inflicting mass carnage on the unsuspecting student body. By the time he turned the gun on himself, nine people were dead. Another campus shooting just over a week later at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Ariz., appears to be a different story. While details are still spotty, this shooter, appeared to have become enraged during an argument early Friday morning and produced a gun, which he turned on four students before being apprehended by campus police. While indiscriminate killing sprees like the one in Roseburg garner massive national attention, incidents such as the one that occurred this morning in Flagstaff are much more common. In 2012, 32,288 people died from gunshot wounds in the United States – that staggering statistic has been around for several years. It and others like it come out after each mass shooting, but, so far at least, statistics haven't prompted much constructive discussion. The lack of impact from statistics might be caused by cognitive dissonance – the psychological theory that explains how people are more likely to believe more strongly in their beliefs when faced with contrary evidence. Statistics might convince people who already believe what the numbers are supporting, but they are unlikely to change minds. For one thing, statistics can be found to support both sides of the debate, as is true with most controversial issues. For gun rights advocates, low crime rates in Kennesaw, Ga., where gun ownership is mandatory for all heads of household, points to the role that guns can play in deterring crime. In Detroit, the city's police chief came out last year saying that the number of guns in the city likely contributed to the drop in crime. That thinking has prompted calls to ramp up armed security in the nation's schools, churches, and other public places. Further complicating the discussion, statistics often fail to provide the full context of the data. The figure 32,288 people killed in 2012 is often pulled out in the aftermath of a shooting spree. However, only an estimated 502 – less than 2 percent – of those people were killed in mass shootings, according data analysis conducted by The Oregonian. Some 64 percent of the 32,288 gunshot deaths in 2012 were a result of suicide by gun, according to research published in the 2015 Annual Review of Public Health. Media outlets often miss the suicide trend, Newsweek's Mike Mariani reported. The 2013 attempt by Slate via Twitter handle @GunDeaths to track fatal gun violence in the United States resulted in 11,400, about 20,000 less than the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports almost annually. In Newsweek's report on gun danger, the missing 20,000 were almost all suicides. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/09/here-we-go-obama-seriously-considering-using-executive-action-to-expand-background-checks-for-private-gun-sales/,"I don’t get it. I mean, I get that President Overreach has contempt for the idea that new laws are supposed to originate with Congress, not him. What I don’t get is why it took him this long to try something like this. The timeline in brief: On Monday, Hillary announced that she’d use executive action as president to reduce the number of private gun sales conducted without a background check. The way she planned to do that was by “clarifying” what it meant to be “engaged in the business” of selling firearms for purposes of federal law. The fear is that some people are selling guns regularly but sporadically and in low enough volume that they can claim, if prosecuted, that they’re not really “in the business” of doing so. Hillary wanted to define the term to put a number on it — sell 25 guns, say, and you magically become an official gun dealer as a matter of federal law, which means you need to start doing background checks on everyone you sell to. The left naturally stood up and cheered the idea even though none of the mass shootings over the last few years that have drawn public attention to gun control have involved this sort of sale. As it turns out, the Obama White House had considered exactly this same sort of “clarification” as part of Obama’s executive actions on gun control after Sandy Hook in 2013, but they had ruled it out at the time — for sound prudential reasons, notes Greg Sargent: The Obama administration looked at this idea, officials tell me, studying whether “engaged in the business” could be defined with, say, a threshold number of guns sold — say, 50 or 100 per year. If this were done, those who identify as private sellers (and sell without background checks) but sell that many guns could no longer do so without getting a license and performing background checks. But the idea quickly presented complications. One former administration official involved in these discussions tells me that some officials worried it would present new and unforeseen enforcement problems. One senior administration official says some worried internally that defining a commercial seller through a hard sales threshold — as opposed to, say, leaving it to the discretion of law enforcement to determine who is a commercial seller — could be subject to legal challenge and could end up sweeping in people selling guns who clearly were not engaged in it as a long term business. This could create untold logistical — not to say political — difficulties. You can understand why the White House would be reluctant. Once there’s a hard number to define being “in the business” of selling firearms, prosecutors will need to spend more resources tracking every sale by a small-quantity seller in the name of proving he’s hit that number. They have bigger fish to fry, which means that — ironically — some sellers who might otherwise have drawn attention from prosecutors for regular gun sales might now be ignored precisely because they haven’t quite hit the numerical threshold. Meanwhile, and also ironically, a vague threshold for how many gun sales are too many for legal purposes is a better deterrent than a hard number like 50 or 100 per year would be. Under the current rule, if you sell, say, 30 guns a year — two or three each month — you might reasonably worry that your repeated, regular sales mean that you’re “in the business” for purposes of federal law. Simply to protect yourself, you might insist on a background check for those purchasers. With a hard floor of 50 sales to qualify as being “in the business,” you don’t need to worry about background checks so long as you know you won’t sell 50 weapons. In some cases, in other words, a hard number may lead some sellers to be less cautious. So there are obvious reasons not to do this, which is why the White House passed on it once before. But now, because Hillary’s momentarily made it a “do something!” liberal cause celebre, Obama apparently feels he needs to do something: In response to the latest mass shooting during his presidency, President Obama is seriously considering circumventing Congress with his executive authority and imposing new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers… In the wake of last week’s tragedy, Obama said he had asked his team “to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.” “We are hopeful we can find a way to do this,” said one senior administration official, who noted that lawyers were still working through details to ensure that the rule could pass legal muster. “It’s a lot more clear today than it was a year ago how to work this out.”… White House officials drafted the proposal in late 2013 to apply to those dealers who sell at least 50 guns annually, after Congress had rejected legislation that would have expanded background checks more broadly to private sellers. While the White House Office of Legal Counsel and then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. initially concluded the regulation was legally defensible, according to several individuals involved in the discussions, some federal lawyers remained concerned that setting an arbitrary numerical threshold could leave the rule vulnerable to a challenge. Back to the beginning, then: Why’d Obama feel obliged to move on this now? He’s a lame duck who has nothing to fear from the left. He ruled out the idea once before on logistical grounds. Enacting the new rule now steals some of Hillary’s thunder by obviating one of her campaign promises (“he’s helping Biden!”), but it also lets her boast on the trail that her idea was so good that the president decided to put it in force ASAP (“he’s helping Hillary!”). My theory, which is always my theory with Obama nowadays, is that it’s a pure legacy thing. He doesn’t want to leave office with liberals grumbling that he didn’t do every last thing he could have to limit gun sales, even if it means small-potatoes gestures like this. So he’s going to do it. And gun sales, naturally, are going to explode again among gun aficionados once he does. The left gets its stupid feelgood “we did something!” empty gesture and gun owners get a few hundred thousand more guns in circulation. Everybody wins, I guess. By the way, since we’re on the subject of Obama doing things he has no legal power to do, if you missed it in Headlines earlier you should read this Fox News piece by James Rosen arguing pretty convincingly that the part of the Iran nuclear deal that lets foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies trade with Iran is actually barred by a federal statute that was signed by Obama himself. The story didn’t get much feedback in Headlines for the same reason that I’m not interested in writing a post about it — legal or not, Obama will find a way somehow to implement that part of the deal anyway. At least, that is, until federal courts decide that the executive branch has amassed so much power that it can no longer afford to wave off court challenges to the president’s authority by Congress as “political question” matters.

She directed some of her criticism at former Gov. Jeb Bush -- one of the Republican presidential candidates from her home state of Florida: ""A message for Jeb Bush: 380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone. ‘Stuff’ doesn't just ‘happen.’ Inaction happens,"" she said in an Oct. 2 tweet. (Here’s the background of what Bush said.) A reader asked PolitiFact to look at her statistical claim, because if you divide victims by shootings, then the numbers suggest that there are less than two deaths per ""mass"" shooting.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/JAfwuinusxE/,"President Barack Obama may be ready to issue an executive order in answer to gun violence in America. It wouldn't be his first. In total, Obama has issued 23 orders since 2012 in the hopes of curbing the troubling onslaught of mass shootings. His actions were prompted in large part by the Sandy Hook shooting, which saw 20 children and six adults killed. It became apparent that Obama was ready to act -- with or without Congress -- when he addressed the nation last Thursday, following the Umpqua College mass shooting tragedy.   According to CBS News, the newest executive order by Obama would firmly clarify which persons or businesses are federally registered gun dealers. The Washington Post writes that dealers who exceed a certain number of sales per year ""would be required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives."" It would also make background checks mandatory for anyone hoping to purchase weapons from these dealers.  — CBS Local (@cbslocal) October 9, 2015  — CBS Local (@cbslocal) October 9, 2015  — Touré (@Toure) October 6, 2015  — Touré (@Toure) October 6, 2015  Though conservatives note that executive orders by Obama haven't halted mass shootings, it's worth noting that deregulating the gun industry and giving dangerous individuals easier access to weapons isn't a viable solution either. We might not go the same route as Australia, which enacted strict gun laws in the wake of the 1996 Port Author massacre. However, Obama is right when it comes to our gun culture and related gun violence problem. The act of sending thoughts and prayers really isn't enough. Proactive measures must be taken.  — FOX 12 Oregon KPTV (@fox12oregon) October 9, 2015  — FOX 12 Oregon KPTV (@fox12oregon) October 9, 2015  In this case: was the 2nd amendment created with the expectation that America would devolve into a place where mass shootings were a daily reality thanks to lax gun regulation?

X OUR PICKS: Minnesota’s two public college systems say they have emergency plans in place for each campus and campuswide alert systems to warn students, faculty and staff in the event of a shooting or other emergency.
The University of Minnesota system and the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system say campus emergency plans are reviewed and communicated to faculty and students. But students who spoke with the Associated Press said they wouldn’t necessarily know what to do in a shooting situation.
The University of Minnesota system, which has five campuses statewide, has a texting alert system, an outdoor alert system, the ability to lock down buildings and, in some buildings, the capability to talk to people through fire panels, said spokesman Steven Henneberry.
Police on the Twin Cities campus, the system’s largest with more than 32,000 undergraduate students, also conduct active-shooter training for faculty, staff and student groups that request it, Henneberry said. In addition, the university did a full-scale active-shooter exercise in 2013. 


Matt Barnes, a 30-year-old civil engineering student at the university’s Twin Cities campus, said that as a transfer student this fall, he got a booklet during orientation that describes the school’s text alert system and public announcement capabilities. He said he’s received text messages before, and gets emails when a crime occurs.
“I think if something goes down and you are not in the building that it’s happening, I think they would do a good job of keeping you away from going there,” Barnes said, adding, “Now, what they can do to prevent someone from coming in that’s got a grudge … I’m not really sure.”
He also said that while he feels safe on campus, he has “no idea” what he’s supposed to do if he’s in a building where something was happening.
In the MnSCU system, which has 54 campuses and more than 430,000 students statewide, emergency procedures are commonly posted in classrooms, distributed through email and included in student handbooks, said MnSCU spokesman Doug Anderson. Campuses are required to test emergency response plans each year, and campuswide lockdown procedures that would generally apply to active-shooter situations are often selected for those tests, he said.
He said recent updates include a new systemwide emergency alert system and remote locking systems. 


Tom Hergert, president of the faculty association at St. Cloud State University, said faculty members receive emails about emergency policies.
In the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon this month, he said, there’s a push for more robust communications. At a recent Faculty Senate meeting, he said, members talked about bringing in a speaker from campus security.
“Do all 800 faculty know what to do in an active-shooter situation? I seriously doubt it,” he said, adding that more should be done to keep faculty informed.
Annie Brecht, 20, a third-year student at Minnesota State University Mankato, said she receives text messages and emails when something happens on campus.
“I don’t know the procedures of what I would do, but I know that’s how they would alert us,” said Brecht, who’s studying communication disorders.
“So far, what I think they are doing is enough,” she said. “I haven’t had a feeling of feeling unsafe.” Minnesota’s two public college systems say they have emergency plans in place for each campus and campuswide alert systems to warn students, faculty and staff in the event of a shooting or other emergency.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2486595/protests-against-texas-campus-carry-bill-takes-a-new-and-ingenious-turn-using-dildos-and-cocksnotglocks/,"In the wake of the Oregon shooting and, in fact, all campus centered shootings, there are many people who feel that the new Texas law is unfair and unsafe. The new Texas-approved ""campus carry"" law gives the legal freedom for students to carry concealed weapons -- handguns -- to classrooms, dorms, and other campus buildings. One group of students have decided to protest the passing of the bill by shedding light on another, lesser known, and much less dangerous rule, against the carrying of a toy of a sexual nature in public, a dildo.  When last checked, Addicting Info advised that over 1,000 students had green lit their attendance for the unusual protest at the University of Texas. Arming themselves with the mantra #CocksNotGlocks, the organizing body of the protest were sure to point out that while carrying weapons to class will be deemed acceptable and appropriate, carrying a dildo will land students in some hot water with campus officials. Their Facebook event page, ""Campus (Dildo) Carry,"" has the reason for their dildo carrying plans nicely detailed.  The ""Campus (Dildo) Carry"" is scheduled to go into effect the same day as the ""campus carry,"" and if all goes according to plan, there will be quite a different meaning to the scenario of students packing heat on campus that day. The event is a public one, and Jin invites one and all to join in #CocksNotGlocks.  [Photo by Aitormmfoto / Shutterstock.com]"
http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2015/10/ben_carson_responds_to_mass_sh.html,"11DARCY-CARSON.jpg Dr. Ben Carson and Jeb Bush responded to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College with comments many found insensitive and offensive. CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Dr. Ben Carson and Jeb Bush responded to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College with mass insensitivity. Bush was asked what the appropriate response should be to the latest mass shooting. He called the incident ""heartbreaking."" Then Bush added, ""Look, stuff happens, there's always a crises. And the impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Bush's impulse to say ""stuff happens"" was not the right thing to do.  Neither were the series of insensitive, inaccurate and uninformed comments Dr. Ben Carson fired off in rapid succession about the Oregon shooting and the Holocaust. Speaking to ""Fox and Friends,"" Carson suggested the victims of the Oregon shooting could have done more to prevent the carnage. ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't kill us all.' "" Survivor Mathew Downing was ""fairly upset"" with Carson's comment. The 18-year-old said, ""Nobody could truly understand what actions they would take in a situation like that unless they lived it."" Carson would later claim he had lived it. 30 years ago, Carson allegedly was held at gunpoint  at a Popeye's restaurant in Baltimore.  ""Guy comes in, puts the gun in my ribs, and I just said, ' I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.' "" So, Carson suggests the Oregon victims didn't act courageously, but when he was held at gunpoint, he didn't tackle the gunman, instead Carson points the gunman to the store clerk. That's the kind of Carson courage we can expect when Dr. Joe Cool is in the White House? Until reporters informed him in interviews, Carson was unaware that students had resisted the gunman. Army veteran and student, Chris Mintz was shot 7 times as the gunman forced his way into a classroom while Mintz tried to block the door. Mintz didn't do what Carson did at Popeye's, and in a Carson-like calming voice say to the gunman, ""I believe you want the students behind the chalkboard."" Just as he was oblivious that Oregon students had resisted, Carson is oblivious the Jews gave armed resistance to the Nazis. Following up with his Oregon comments, Carson said the Holocaust would have been prevented had the Jewish population been armed. ""The likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,"" said Carson. Jonathan Greenblatt, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League called Carson's comments historically inaccurate. Greenblatt added, ""Gun Control did not cause the Holocaust; Nazism and anti-Semitism did. It's a fact, unacknowledged by Carson, that Jews gave armed resistance during the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and all over Europe during the entire war. It's also a fact, unacknowledged by Carson, that it ended up taking the entire might of the combined allied forces of the United States, Russia, Great Britain and France, along with others, to defeat the Nazi war machine that Carson suggested could have been defeated just by an armed Jewish population. Carson called the ADL's response  ""total foolishness."" He's been equally dismissive of Darwinism and the ""Big Bang"" theory. Instead of demanding to authenticate Obama's birth certificate, maybe Trump should demand that Carson's medical degree and certification as a neurosurgeon are authenticated. As a Doctor, Carson said he ""spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies ... but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" Sounds like Carson never examined the Sandy Hook victims. The president and gun control advocates aren't talking about taking away the right to bear arms, anyway. They're advocating common-sense gun regulations, like background checks. Does Carson really think background checks and licensing regulations on par with those to operate a car, are worse than the devastation done to the bodies of the little Sandy Hook victims by hollow-point bullets fired from an assault rifle? Last Saturday, in Tennessee, an 11-year-old boy allegedly killed his 8-year-old neighbor with a shotgun - over her puppy. How long before the campaign buses of Bush and Carson are sporting NRA bumper stickers reading, ""Stuff Happens. Guns don't kill kids, puppies kill kids"" and ""Have you armed your 8-year-old today?."" Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/11/barack-obama-pushes-gun-control-case,"President gives advice and says Republican candidates seeking to succeed him in 2016 are painting a dismal picture for voters Last modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 18.03 GMT President Barack Obama on Saturday used a speech to more than 1,000 supporters at a fundraising event in San Francisco to make his continuing case for action on gun control.  Obama got some of his loudest applause when making the case for changes in the nation’s gun laws, saying the amount of gun violence taking place in the US is not normal. “We know we’ve got to do something to prevent the kind of gun massacres that we see with growing frequency in this country,” he said. The president returned to the gun issue near the close of his remarks at the DNC fundraiser in Los Angeles. He noted that he went to Oregon the day before to visit with families of those killed at the community college. Two more college shootings occurred on the same day, in Arizona and Texas. While some protested during his visit, Obama said he felt just a strongly that such shootings are not inevitable and that the public should encourage lawmakers to take on the gun issue. The president also said Republican candidates seeking to succeed him in 2016 were painting a dismal picture for voters. “There’s almost no measure by which we’re not better off than when I took office and when we started this process for change,” he said. “But it does kind of make you wonder. Why are so many Republican politicians so down on America? Why are they so grumpy?” Obama has been using his fundraising speeches and many others to point to progress he says the country has made in the past seven years, including a drop in unemployment and the addition of millions of people to the rolls of those with health insurance. He also counseled the crowd to be politically active, saying he planned to remain so when his presidency concludes and declaring: “I’m just getting started.” Obama was in California for four fundraisers, one in San Francisco and three in Los Angeles. NBA star Stephen Curry and other members of the Golden State Warriors warmed up the San Francisco crowd. Those attending the Democratic National Committee fundraiser paid between $250 and $10,000. The fundraiser featured an appearance by the rapper Kanye West, who recently said he might run for president in 2020. “I do have some advice for him,” Obama said. “Just some stuff that I’ve picked up on the way.” Obama’s first tip could have been aimed at reality TV star turned Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and maybe a few others in the crowded GOP field. “First of all, you’ve got to spend a lot of time dealing with some strange characters who behave like they’re on a reality TV show,” Obama said. “So you’ve just to be cool with that.” Tip No2 referenced West’s fifth studio album. “Saying that you have a Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy – that’s what’s known as ‘off-message’ in politics,” Obama said. “You can’t say something like that. There are a lot of people who have lost their congressional seats saying things like that.” Tip No3 hit the Chicago-raised West close to home. “Do you really think that this country is going to elect a black guy from the South Side of Chicago with a funny name to be president of the United States?” Obama asked. “That is crazy. That’s cray!” Obama, aka POTUS, also joked that West has his own nickname for the person in the White House: Peezy. West also is thinking about running for speaker of the House, Obama cracked. “Couldn’t get any stranger,” he said, of the internecine Republican struggle over the roll. In Los Angeles, Obama attended his first fundraiser at the home of movie director JJ Abrams. He then went to a fundraiser for the DNC, where about 200 supporters contributed up $33,400. Jamie Foxx and his band performed before Obama spoke. The White House said Obama called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to express his condolences for the twin explosions on Saturday that killed at least 95 people attending a peace rally in Ankara. Obama was scheduled to go to the San Diego area for golf on Sunday and Monday, then head back to Washington."

http://www.inquisitr.com/2487554/alan-homes-oregon-teen-suspended-for-wearing-patriotic-t-shirt-showing-a-gun/,"An Oregon 8th grader was suspended from school for wearing a patriotic T-shirt that showed a gun, the Washington Post is reporting. Alan Holmes, a student at Dexter McCarty Middle School in Gresham, Oregon, says he was inspired to wear his favorite patriotic T-shirt, which depicts a pair of boots, a gun, and a helmet -- widely used as a sort of battlefield memorial (called a ""Battlefield Cross"") to fallen soldiers in the U.S. military -- in honor of his brother.   Alan's brother, who isn't named in reports, joined the Marines at 19, and served a tour in Iraq. Alan still remembers the day his brother arrived home safely from the war.  Unfortunately for the Oregon teenager, his school's principal found the gun on his t-shirt problematic, and gave him an ultimatum: change shirts or get suspended, according to KATU (Portland). Alan refused to back down.  Alan's father, Charlie Holmes, says he is proud of his son's decision to stand up for what he believes is right.  Alan, however, insists that the gun on his T-shirt isn't about violence -- it's about fallen servicemen and women.  In a larger sense, Alan's t-shirt choice comes at a time when schools across the country adhere to a policy of Zero Tolerance when it comes to guns and other weapons -- or even suggestions of guns and weapons -- in schools. Students have faced discipline for bringing toy guns to school, for making a gun shape with their fingers and pointing it at classmates, even for chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun.  Similarly, a Texas student was suspended from school earlier this year for wearing a t-shirt to school depicting an American flag -- school officials said it violated the school's dress code, which required students to wear solid-color shirts. Alan tells KPTV (Portland) that his suspension has motivated him to learn more about the Battlefield Cross memorial in his spare time. [Image courtesy of: YouTube]"
http://www.ocregister.com/articles/every-686925-media-shooting.html,"Trending: Another tragedy unfolded this month when a disturbed 26-year-old student shot to death nine people and injured nine others before taking his own life during a shootout with police at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. There are many aspects to this story – the lives lost and altered, gun laws, Second Amendment rights, mental health treatment, the use of psychiatric drugs common to most of the mass shooters in recent years – but let us start with the media’s coverage of this and similar events. It is as though the same script is trotted out for every mass shooting: The national media descend upon the site of the horror, the murderer’s name and image are splashed over every television, newspaper and radio station. Politicians and other advocates get before the cameras to express their outrage and call for more gun control laws. Firstly, this media reaction appears rather peculiar to such shooting incidents. We do not see the same media circus and national calls to ban alcohol – or cars – every time a drunken driver kills innocent people. We do not see the driver’s name and image on every news broadcast and on the front page of every newspaper. We also call into question the practice of repeatedly using perpetrators’ names and images. “I continue to believe that those media and community members who publicize his name will only glorify his horrific actions … and eventually this will only serve to inspire future shooters,” said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who is presiding over the investigation of the Roseburg shooting. We are naturally curious to learn more information about such criminals so that we can try to ascribe a motive and a means of preventing future such calamities, but we can do that without rewarding murderers with the posthumous fame and recognition that they could not achieve by peaceful and productive means in life. There are real consequences to this, as this morbid fame often spurs other unstable individuals to seek the same for themselves. A study by Arizona State University and Northeastern Illinois University researchers published this year found that 20 percent to 30 percent of mass killings and school shootings appear to arise from “contagion.” This may well have been the case in the Oregon shooting. A blog post apparently written by the shooter cited another gunman’s killing in August of a local television news reporter and cameraman during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Va. “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day,” it read. “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.” For this very reason, journalists generally do not publicize suicides – unless they involve famous people or occur in a particularly public place – as they do not want to encourage copycats. Perhaps we should adopt the same policy for mass murderers. Get the latest news delivered daily!

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/Nzl3z0g3v0E/john-oliver-slams-toyota-over-isis-trucks-toyotas-are-being-used-as-instruments-of-death.html,"SEARCH The host of HBO’s ‘Last Week Tonight’ ripped the Japanese auto maker a new one for having tons of their trucks fall into the hands of ISIS. Senior Entertainment Editor John Oliver does not suffer fools gladly. Whether it’s shady televangelists fleecing poor Bible-thumpin’ Americans for millions or the GOP for their reaction to the recent mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, the witty Brit has used his platform as host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight to skewer hypocrites of all types.This week, the acclaimed satirist directed his ire at Toyota, the world’s No. 1 car manufacturer. “Finally tonight, we move to Toyota, makers of the ’92 Camry where you got your first backseat handjob. Toyota is famous for making dependable vehicles, but this week, we learned something surprising about who exactly has been depending on them,” announced Oliver. Yes, Toyota has become the preferred car manufacturer of the so-called Islamic State widely known as ISIS, with the terrorist organization’s propaganda videos boasting massive convoys of Toyota Hilux pickup trucks and Land Cruisers. And now, a U.S. Counterterrorism Unit has begun interrogating the Japanese automaker about how so many of its automobiles, both new and old, are making their way into the hands of ISIS. “It seems that Toyotas are being used as instruments of death,” said Oliver. “It’s a bold move because traditionally ‘death on wheels’ has very much been GM’s brand.”   In a statement to ABC News, Toyota claimed it was not aware of any of its dealerships violating the company policy not to sell to terrorist groups. “Hold on—you actually felt the need to make ‘not selling to terrorists’ official company policy? Is that in the handbook under, ‘Things that should go without saying?’” joked Oliver. “The amazing thing is this is not a new story,” Oliver continued. “Terrorist groups love Toyota vehicles. Back in 2001, The New York Times reported that Osama bin Laden ‘likes Toyota Land Cruisers,’ and Newsweek once ran a story about, ‘Why Rebel Groups Love the Toyota Hilux.’ And in light of the news this week, you would think Toyota would at least change the name of one of their cars.”  You guessed it: Toyota sells a make of car called the “Isis”—a seven-seat minivan with a panoramic door and four-wheel drive. “Oh, come on, Toyota! You’re giving ISIS built-in vanity plates!” joked Oliver. “It seems Toyota might have a genuine problem here, because ISIS seems to really like their cars.” Indeed, a former U.S. ambassador to the UN told ABC News that, “Toyota has almost become part of the ISIS brand.” “At this rate, we are almost a few months away from ISIS-owned dealerships, complete with fully-armed windsock guy,” said Oliver. “‘Come on down to ISIS Toyota, our salesmen are terrorists you can negotiate with!’”"
http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Brauer-On-gun-violence-more-mental-health-6564864.php,"After a terrible tragedy like the Oct. 1 mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, everyone from our nation's commander-in-chief, to presidential candidates, to NRA members is commenting on what needs to be done, or not done. Those who believe that taking a look at our gun laws is not the answer seem to think that the problem is our mental health system. They conclude that if we fix that, we'll ""fix"" the problem of gun violence. Here's the flaw with this thinking. First, most individuals who struggle with mental illness are not violent and are not at risk of hurting themselves or others. An estimated 883,000 Texans have serious mental health concerns, and many have no access to care. But providing that care will not be a panacea for our gun-violence epidemic. Second, of the thousands of people struggling with mental health concerns, some seek treatment and some, for various reasons, do not. Sometimes it's a choice, and sometimes it is due to a lack of resources. But make no mistake about it: We will always have people who struggle with mental illness, and there will always be a subset that is left untreated. So the notion that we will ever eradicate mental illness for all Americans is simply not based in reality any more than the notion that we will ever be able to eradicate all other physical ailments. That leads to the question of what in fact can be done to reduce gun violence? In addition to a nationwide focus on resources for mental health issues, the clear answer is that we must focus on the issue of access to firearms. This would better ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of individuals who, due to mental illness, are a danger to themselves or others. It would also prevent guns from reaching the hands of those with criminal records and a history of violence. What can the government do? Universal background checks to include gun shows and private sales, as recently passed in Washington State, just makes sense. Done either on a state or federal level, this would provide consistency to our background-check law, and ensure the background-check requirement is linked to the buyer, not the entity or person selling the gun. Without this requirement in place, countless buyers can purchase weapons without any sort of screening of their eligibility to own firearms. Our Second Amendment calls for a ""well-regulated militia,"" and the federal government has established background checks as a part of their role in this regulation. Checks should be performed for every firearm transaction, and those who object by citing an infringement of rights are wrong. The law is already in place, and a background check is not a burden on a law-abiding gun owner with a concern for safety. In my view, these are the only individuals who should be allowed to own them. Some of the 88 daily firearm deaths across the country are due to easy, unchecked access to firearms. Universal background checks are part of the solution to our terrible problem. Brauer is executive director of Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit devoted to reducing gun violence through promotion of common-sense policies."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/-MQr7yIKCHk/guns-are-cheaper-at-this-tennessee-store-if-you-re-a-christian.html,"SEARCH Frontier Firearms knocked down its prices for Christians after the mass shooting in Oregon earlier this month. How nice of them. Political Reporter Christians who are looking a good deal on a gun need look no further than Frontier Firearms. The Kingston, Tennessee liberty-defending establishment began offering 5 percent discounts last week for anyone who says “I’m a Christian” before purchasing a new handgun. The rebate was announced shortly after the tragic shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon earlier this month—where the shooter allegedly asked his victims if their were Christians before shooting them. And what better way to honor victims of a mass shooting than with a a big gun sale? “If Christians are going to be targeted, we need to protect ourselves,” owner Brant Williams said when the discount began. He, and Frontier Firearms vice president Eric Parish, characterize the mass shooting as religiously motivated, citing reports that shooter Chris Harper Mercer asked students about their faith before killing them. “I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, or Republican, an Independent, the Green Party, I don’t care what party you’re with. But to say that that shooting right there had nothing to do with religion is ludicrous,” Parish told the Daily Beast. “What if someone had done the same thing and they only shot them if they were Muslim? Would the President react differently?” Parish alleges the sale, now extended until the end of the month (so hurry!), is no longer reserved for just Christians—or people who say they are Christians— but any and all people willing to declare a religion prior to buying a new weapon. If a customer said they were Muslim, would there still be a discount. “Of course,” according to Parish, so long as they didn’t also say they were an extremist planning a mass shooting. Obviously. “Religion was a part of this country’s founding, you know religious freedom. And that’s what it’s about,” Parish said. “Being able to say ‘hey I’m this,’ without getting shot in the back of the head because of it.” Frontier Firearms has gotten their fair share of colorful commentary from customers who do not appreciate the creative sale. “FUCK YOU, you fucking fear mongering opportunistic scum wads!” wrote one thoughtful potential customer. “You fucking gun idiots make me sick. BTW the Oregon shooter was a Conservative Republican… he was one of you. BTW the bearded fool is he the owner? He looks like a JEWBAG.” Not exactly the armed, kumbaya  Parish was hoping for. Despite Parish alleging that the store is welcoming any and all faiths, Frontier Firearms’ owner is promoting his own Christian Carry Pins which as the name suggests read: “I am Christian and I carry.” They are $5.00 each which is way less than the 5 percent customers would save on the new guns they buy. Semi-automatic pistols are available at Fronteir Firearms for as low as $408. “This is America,” Parish said. “And I’m still pretty sure you can pick what your religion is without being persecuted for it.”"
http://www.startribune.com/variety/blogs/332336392.html," Patrick J. Kennedy knows unequivocally that it is a miracle he is still alive. The 48-year-old son of the late Sen. Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and social anxiety in his teens. For more than 20 years, he self-medicated with alcohol and a litany of prescription painkillers, and was in and out of treatment programs — always in secrecy — before he'd play the system and start abusing again. Today, the former U.S. Representative from Rhode Island is a family man and public speaker, devoting his life to fighting for equality in care and coverage for those facing mental illness or addictions. Kennedy will be at Westminster Presbyterian Church in downtown Minneapolis at 7 p.m. Tuesday to talk about his new book — ""A Common Struggle: A Personal Journey Through The Past and Future of Mental Illness and Addiction"" — and his new life. He talked with us about the toughest years of his life, his family's reaction to his raw and honest book, the joy his children provide to him on a daily basis, and his devotion to a few Minnesotans who helped to change the trajectory of his life.

                                            Patrick Kennedy's book ""A Common Struggle."" Q: Most families have a loved one facing mental health issues. And, yet, here we are in 2015 still fighting for mental health parity. Are you optimistic that we are, in fact, making progress? A: We are in the battle. A lot of people pay lip service to this as a disease. We get anemic policy proposals from our leadership and we're supposed to be happy. If this were any other illness, like diabetes or cancer, we'd be declaring it a public health epidemic.  Q: Why do you think most people are still reticent to talk openly about mental illness? A: It's such a threat to who we are as people. When we're perceived to not have control over our actions, it's terrifying. No one wants to get close to that. The paradox is that, by avoiding helping ourselves and others become mentally well, we actually are becoming what we fear becoming.  Q: After every mass shooting, a discussion of mental illness comes up. Is there misinformation you'd like to clear up about gun violence and mental illness? A: The way the media covers these issues perpetuates the mythology and stigma and prejudice. Most people with mental illness are not violent. More than twice as many people die by suicide each year than by homicide, and that's probably undercounted. Read the obituaries about a young person who ""died unexpectedly"" or ""died suddenly."" Those are the telltale signs. Until we get over the shame that we feel around these issues, we'll never be able to expect policymakers to act differently.  Q: Many families are fully aware and engaged, but still are devastated that they couldn't stop just such a tragedy. What do you say to them? A: The reason I'm telling this story now is because, with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (which passed in 2008 and is starting to be implemented), it is illegal to cover mental illnesses and addiction any differently than any other medical conditions. Eight years ago, people would say, ""That's fine, Patrick. Your family can afford the treatment."" And they'd have a point. But today under the law, their insurance is required to provide the whole spectrum of services in the same way they would if you had diabetes or asthma. I understand that the system has not built out the infrastructure to make good on that law, but the only way for us to make that happen is to enforce that law. We can't just have more anti-stigma candlelight marches. We have to tell our attorneys general and our insurers that they have a responsibility to protect us. Our brothers and sisters are dying because they're not getting the treatment they need. Susan Walsh &#x2022; Associated Press
                

                                            Patrick Kennedy’s new memoir takes a hard look at his life, and how he and his family struggled with substance abuse and mental health issues. Q: You write that you ""grew up among people who were geniuses at not talking about things."" I think that is true for many families. How do we get the conversations started? A: We have to internalize how life and death this is. By living in the darkness and keeping these secrets, there is a price to pay. It's corrosive to every single person in the family when they deny the illness of their loved one. It's a family illness. No one escapes being impacted in the most profound way. You don't have to force a conversation. You just have to be open to the moment when that conversation is possible. And you have to not let that conversation pass you by.  Q: How were you able to recall so many details from those addicted years? A: Living a public life meant that I had a lot of things that were on the record, such as my medical history, all my doctors' notes, therapist and psychiatrist's notes. I met with all my providers and asked them to provide me with my notes. Also, serving for 16 years in Congress, I had a computerized schedule. I periodically kept a journal and correspondences that I threw into a box. You add all that together and it provides a pretty full picture. Stephen [co-author Stephen Fried] did a terrific job of weaving it all together.  Q: Minnesota and Minnesotans have been good to you. You did four stays at the Mayo Clinic. You knew the late U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, who co-sponsored the Mental Health Parity Amendment. Jim Ramstad is a father figure in your life. A: I was next-door neighbors to Paul in an apartment called Justice Court. You can't make this up. I used to see him practically every day. We'd walk together in the morning or the late evening. Obviously, he was a hero of mine. My ultimate question is, What would Paul Wellstone do? He would not be sitting down while this [mental health disparity] was happening. That's for sure. Jim? I can't say anything except that Jim was all heart. All heart. He went to court with me. He was a witness for me, in terms of lending his power and credibility to me as a fellow suffering alcoholic, standing with me as the world's press corps was interrogating me on my DWI, and then personally introducing me to his network of friends in recovery.  Q: Some of your family members are not happy with the book. How are you dealing with that? A: It's difficult. My in-laws love the book. My wife, who is not accustomed to all this attention, married me and she's stood by me. It's a very hopeful thing. I want to live in this new space. That doesn't happen without throwing yourself over the wall. This book is throwing my life into a new place and now I have to catch that and live in a new space.  Q: Your relationship with your father was complex and painful, but ultimately redemptive. What did you learn from him that you hope to instill in your children? A: I naturally grab my children and kiss them every moment of the day. I read them stories and they sit on my lap. No matter what important e-mail or phone call I have to return, when I am with them, I focus on them. I turn my phone off. I don't look away. I have to say I give my dad a great deal of credit for giving me this internal guidebook on how vital is it to physically embrace your children.  Q: You left congress in 2011, are happily married with three young children and another on the way. You are founder of the Kennedy Forum, which is dedicated to mental health issues. You're four-and-a-half years sober. How did you get here? A: I think that God was with me all along. I mean, there is no way I could have planned this life to work out the way it did. Today, I try to align myself with that plan by getting out of the way and trying to do the next right thing.  gail.rosenblum@startribune.com 612-673-7350 Follow Gail on Twitter: @grosenblum Gail Rosenblum is editor of the Inspired section.

This past Saturday, at a little after 10 a.m., two bombs exploded at a peace rally in Ankara, Turkey. Ninety-five people have been reported killed and nearly two hundred injured. That the deadliest terrorist act ever committed on Turkish soil targeted peace activists calling for an end to hostilities between the Kurdish Workers’ Party, or PKK, and the Turkish government adds a particularly bitter sting to the tragedy. After national elections four months ago left no party with a governing majority or able to form a coalition, and after Turkey’s offensive against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, these attacks have sadly become more frequent—Diyarbakır in June, Suruç in July. And now Ankara. Though I live in Istanbul I often hear of these attacks through a concerned note from back home, as was the case this Saturday. I was napping when the phone rang. Two days earlier I had returned from a trip to the U.S. and, jetlagged, I needed an hour’s rest. I reluctantly checked the caller I.D.—the toy store down the block. I’ve had a red electric car on order for my 3-year-old son, a two-speed Mini Cooper that kids can drive themselves at a slow-setting of 3 miles per hour, or a more precarious fast-setting of 6 mph. I answered the phone. The car had arrived and I needed to pick it up. Then I saw an email from my father: Are you okay? I checked the news, and then I called my father back. Saturday’s events were horrific. They of course caused me to reflect on whether I am safe living with my young children in Turkey. And yet looking at the bombing in the context of the past two weeks—Russia’s initiation of airstrikes in Syria, the Taliban’s conquest of Kunduz and the American bombing of the Médecins Sans Frontières’ hospital there, flooding in the Carolinas that left 17 dead, and the nine killed in a mass shooting in Oregon—Turkey feels about as secure as anywhere else. Security is always relative. When I was in the Marines, I would listen to rifle snaps above my head while crouching along rooftops in al-Anbar Province or laying belly down on ridgelines near the Afghan-Pakistan border. You’re dead if you stand up, but you’re fine if you stay low. We called this boundary our “relative safety.” The boundary line is always invisible, one you can intuit but never truly know unless you violate it. Like being killed by terrorists at a peace rally, or like learning that coming home from a war is statistically more dangerous than fighting in one (suicide eclipsed combat deaths long ago with post-9/11 veterans killing themselves at a rate of 22 a day) our notions of safety often seem arbitrary. Why do some forms of violence—the beheading of journalists by ISIS, or a bombing in Ankara—make us feel so threatened, while other forms—the 298 separate mass shootings in America thus far this year, or the 4,219 Syrian killed last month—do little to challenge our sense of safety? It might be because certain kinds of violence falls into a pattern that becomes predictable, and through that predictability we feel as though we can know the boundary line of relative safety. We feel we can make choices to control our level of risk. Live in Turkey, or don’t. Give school teachers pistols, or don’t. When confronted with random acts of violence such control makes us feel safe, but perhaps this is illusory. Christopher Nolan captured this in his script for The Dark Knight. Holding the mayor of Gotham hostage, the Joker says: “You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go ‘according to plan.’ Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it’s all ‘part of the plan.’ But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I’m an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It’s fair!” Turkish political life feels increasingly chaotic, and not particularly fair. In the wake of the bombing, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu’s government immediately imposed a media blackout, shutting down social networks like Twitter in order to regulate “images that create a feeling of panic.” This did not stop thousands from flooding Istanbul’s Taksim Square on Saturday night to criticize the government response, and to stand in solidarity with the peace protesters. While the government has placed blame for the Ankara bombing on either ISIS or Kurdish separatists in the southeast, Selahattin Demirtaş the leader of the Peoples Democratic Party, or HDP, which represents Kurdish interests in the parliament, accused the Turkish government of carrying out the bombing. He urged world leaders to withhold their condolences to Davutoğlu. “This is not an attack against unity of our state and nation,” Demirtaş said. “This is an attack by our nation against our people.” Just as conclusive evidence never emerged around the June bombing in Diyarbakır and the July bombing in Suruç, it is unlikely that conclusive evidence will emerge in Ankara. With national elections scheduled for November 1, what does seem likely is that there will be other terrorist attacks. Just as it is likely there will be more mass shootings in the United States, that veterans will commit suicide at alarming rates, and that the Syrian civil war will drag on. What is also likely is that the minute any one form of violence begins to feel status quo, some new agent of chaos will emerge causing us all to lose a little more sleep, especially those of us with small children. While Turkish investigators pieced through the bloodshed in Ankara, I sat in my living room with a screwdriver assembling my son’s red Mini Cooper, only paying partial attention to the task while watching for updates about the bombing on the local news. As much as he wanted to get outside with his new toy, I felt it would be wise to stay indoors for the rest of Saturday, just to be safe. But eventually I caved, figuring we would be all right if we stayed in our neighborhood. Soon we were heading out of my flat toward Bebek Park and its sprawling playground which runs along the Bosphorus. When we arrived, the regular crowds of parents appeared a bit thin. Yet as my son sat behind the wheel, everything seemed fine. Then he floored the gas pedal, careening dangerously toward the water at 6 miles per hour. I chased after him in a panic. Preoccupied as I’d been watching for security updates on the news, I had forgotten to switch his car to its slowest, safest setting."
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/democratic-debate-cnn-las-vegas-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders,"The Democratic presidential field may seem tame compared to the Republicans, but the gloves will be off as the candidates square off in their first debate Last modified on Wed 25 Aug 2021 14.58 BST Compared with the unruly Republican pack, the Democratic presidential field can seem tame, with relatively few candidates, a strong frontrunner and zero candidates coming off careers in casinos, computers or neurosurgery.  And yet the debut debate among the Democrats scheduled for Tuesday night promises plenty of colorful clashes, whether that means Bernie Sanders implicitly accusing Hillary Clinton of being a fake working-class hero, or Clinton accusing Sanders of turning a blind eye on guns, or all five candidates grappling with questions about Black Lives Matter, climate change or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It’s worth noting that between them, the Democratic candidates have participated in 21 televised presidential debates in the past – with Clinton accounting for all 21. Her four challengers will be doing this for the first time. Tuesday night’s host, Anderson Cooper of CNN, has promised a series of pointed questions on bedrock policy issues. Unlike the top-tier Republicans, the Democrats – former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, senator Bernie Sanders, former governor Martin O’Malley, former senator Jim Webb and former governor Lincoln Chafee – may actually have time to answer some of the questions in-depth. Here’s a preview of some of the points of friction and fun to look out for. While global trade deals may not seem like the stuff of sexy television (and yes, the debates are also about ratings), CNN would do well to get in a question early on about TPP, because the unratified trade agreement is both an important area of policy disagreement, and an intersection for a lot of the undercurrents that make the Democratic race viscerally interesting. Core Democratic voters – workers, unions, some in industry – oppose the deal, saying it will depress wages and lure manufacturing abroad. Clinton buckled to this pressure just last week, saying that she could not support TPP in its final version – in spite of having called it “the gold standard in trade agreements” in 2012. Sanders, meanwhile, has always opposed TPP, as vehemently as he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In an October 1993 editorial titled Why I oppose Nafta, he said the deal would exacerbate economic inequality and “only benefit the ruling elites of the United States, Mexico and Canada”. Clinton supported Nafta before she opposed it. The TPP debate, then, could be a good opening for Sanders to spotlight his consistency on policy – billed by supporters as a major selling point – and to accuse Clinton of a lack of the same. Host network CNN has already worked to document Clinton’s TPP flip-flop, including in the recent piece 45 times Secretary Clinton pushed the trade bill she now opposes. Because Clinton is still the prohibitive frontrunner in the Democratic race, her rivals may use the debate to challenge her fitness as a standard-bearer for the left. One way to make the point is by listing issues she has switched sides on. The list is longer than Nafta and TPP. Clinton will be the only candidate onstage Tuesday who ever supported the invasion of Iraq. Even Lincoln Chafee, who was a Republican in the Senate when the 2002 war vote came up, voted against it (he was the only Republican senator to do so). While Clinton supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, Sanders, then in the House of Representatives, voted against the bill and called for an end to discrimination based on sexuality. As governors, both O’Malley and Chafee signed same-sex marriage into law the same year, 2013, that Clinton finally came out in favor of it. Clinton has been a relatively muted critic of income and wealth inequality in the United States, which for Sanders has been a lifelong bugbear. In the Senate, she voted in favor of the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp), which set aside $700bn in part to bail out big banks. Sanders voted no, with considerable passion. With multiple mass shootings having already occurred since the last headline mass shooting, and substantive disagreement among the candidates on guns, debate may actually break out on this issue. It’s one of the few issues on which Clinton runs to the left of Sanders, who hails from a rural, gun-friendly state and who voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and in favor of allowing guns on Amtrak trains. He has supported assault weapons bans. Clinton, meanwhile, has stepped up her anti-gun rhetoric, saying: “We have to take on the gun lobby.” Last week she unveiled a series of proposals aimed at reducing US gun violence, including universal background checks, rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry, and legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. Bookend positions on the issue are held down, meanwhile, by O’Malley and Webb. Webb, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former secretary of the navy, argued in the Senate against any restrictions on access to guns. He meant it: in 2007, an aide was charged with trying to carry a loaded pistol and ammunition into a Senate building. On the other end of the shelf, O’Malley put in place an assault weapons ban as mayor of Baltimore, and as governor of Maryland he signed some of the country’s most restrictive gun laws. Americans are unhappy with the president’s performance on foreign policy, rating Obama at minus-14 approval on the issue in polling averages. One question for Clinton, his former secretary of state, is how much that number will stick to her. Clinton has been distancing herself from the administration’s Syria policy, writing in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices that she had urged Obama to arm the Syrian rebels much earlier, but that she was overruled. More recently, she has supported the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, prompting Obama to observe: “There’s a difference between running for president and being president.” Clinton’s Democratic rivals disagree with her in various ways. Both Webb, a vehement critic of the Iraq war, and Sanders oppose a no-fly zone for Syria, and in general are more leery of deepening US entanglements in the region. O’Malley on Friday said that the rise of Isis in Syria and Iraq had been an accidental result of a “mindless rush to war” in Iraq – a rush Clinton abetted. Both O’Malley and Sanders have strong records of supporting action to combat climate change, while Clinton has been playing catch-up, as a greater share of the public identifies the issue as urgent. The League of Conservation Voters gives Sanders a 95% lifetime rating, compared with 82% for Clinton, 81% for Webb and 78% for Chafee. Bill McKibben, the environmentalist, author and founder of 350.org, told the Guardian back in April that Clinton had failed to lead the US to a deal at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change conference, and he contrasted her record unfavorably with that of Sanders, who co-sponsored a 2007 act to curb carbon emissions. “Let’s hope she either steps up her game, or one of the other contenders becomes a reality,” McKibben said. “Bernie Sanders, for one, has been about the climate’s best friend in the Senate.” In a New Yorker profile published earlier this month, Sanders said he had failed as a candidate in his response to the Black Lives Matter movement. “I plead guilty – I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue,” Sanders was quoted as saying. The cynic could read the apology as a rare gesture of deference by Sanders to the hard realities of electoral math. While a strong showing among educated white voters makes Sanders look competitive in early states including Iowa and New Hampshire, he remains largely unknown among African American voters in the south. In August, Gallup measured Clinton’s favorability among African Americans nationally at 80%. In the same poll, Sanders posted a 23% favorable rating – and only a 33% familiarity rating. Calls for systemic reform to a criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes African American and minority offenders, meanwhile, have most vociferously been made not by Clinton or by Sanders, but by Webb. For decades, Webb has argued that the US puts too many people in prison, and for the wrong reasons. As a senator in 2009, Webb pushed for an 18-month, top-to-bottom review of the entire criminal justice system. “The goal of this legislation,” he wrote, “is nothing less than a complete restructuring of the criminal justice system in the United States.” US immigration policy is another issue on which Clinton has sought to create distance between herself and the Obama administration, which, she has pointed out, has been aggressive in its enforcement of deportations policy, although it makes headlines for suspending some deportations. “I will not be deporting parents,” Clinton told Telemundo last week. “I will not be breaking up families. I will not be doing what we’ve seen too much of, which is trying to, you know, make immigrants the scapegoat for everything that people are concerned about in the country.” It’s also an issue on which Clinton does not come under much pressure from Sanders, who hails from a state where the immigration debate is not particularly active and who has spoken relatively little on the issue so far on the campaign trail. Last week he echoed Clinton’s call for keeping families together, and said that he would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the US. As with guns, meanwhile, O’Malley has led the field in calling for immigration reform, supporting driver’s licenses for undocumented migrants as governor and presenting a plan in July calling for a drastic reduction in immigrant detentions and for the closure of “inhumane” immigration facilities. “My end goal is to get 11 million people out of the shadow economy and the shadow society and into the light of full participation,” O’Malley said, “to be more fully included in the economic, political and social life of our country.”"

Pulpit Gun Pimps

In a country where every hamlet boasts three churches, it's difficult to think
about Christian persecution seriously. And while the gunman at Umpqua CC had
asked people to identify themselves by religion and administered his form of
""justice"" accordingly, Christian ""persecution"" in America
is not exactly a picture of coliseums and lions. The paranoia generated by
people like Janet

Christians are now being treated like the Jews in Nazi Germany) has created at
false atmosphere of fear that now takes over the Right Wing airwaves.

Some preachers are capitalizing on that fear, going so far as to openly promote
gun use everywhere.Next Page  1   |  2   |  3(Note: You can view every article as one long page if you sign up as an Advocate Member, or higher). Next Page  1   |  2   |  3 (Note: You can view every article as one long page if you sign up as an Advocate Member, or higher).  Rate It |

http://www.eurweb.com/2015/10/baltimore-pd-cant-find-record-of-ben-carson-being-held-up-at-popeyes/," *The Baltimore Police Department says it has searched through its databases to find an incident report involving GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson being held up at gunpoint at a Popeyes restaurant in the city – but have been unable to locate such a record. The retired Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon made headlines recently for suggesting that people in the midst of a mass shooting should ban together and rush the shooter to prevent more victims from being killed. “I wouldn’t just stand there and get shot,” he told Fox & Friends last week. Using himself as an example, Dr. Carson has also been telling the story of how he was at a Popeyes restaurant in Baltimore years ago when a man stuck a gun in his ribs. Carson says he told the gunman, “I believe that you want the guy behind the counter,” and that the gunman moved on. Baltimore police said Tuesday they’ve searched several databases of incident reports at Popeyes restaurants as far back as 1987 in response to news media requests, but haven’t found any mentioning Carson. A Carson spokesman says the incident happened “30-plus years ago.” Police say earlier reports require a report number or the name of the person arrested.  So? Maybe he lied. Yeah. His account of the encounter did sound a little suspect. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Photo By Submitted photo/Fred Korth By Jane Ford-Stewart Oct. 13, 2015 Muskego — Different wars and different times, but they all know what it means to serve their country. They are Muskego residents Fred Korth and Charlie Case, Korean War era veterans, and retired US Senator Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran. They came together in Washington, D.C. where the two Muskego veterans were on an Honor Flight recently. Dole, now 92, makes it a point to greet fellow veterans coming to town on Honor Flights that take them to see the nation's memorials to its fighting men and women. ""He was personable, despite his age,"" Korth said, adding he appreciated the retired senator's warm welcome. For both Muskego veterans, the military has been an important part of their lives. In addition to their service, they have belonged to the American Legion for decades. Korth has been commander of Post 356 in Muskego for eight years where Case has been a member since 1964. Korth enlisted in the Navy and served first aboard the USS Fulton, a submarine repair ship based in New London, Conneticut. After fighting stopped in Korea in 1953, he served aboard the USS Boston that was the first guided missile cruiser of her class. ""They could take a plane out five miles away,"" Korth said, speaking of the surface to air missiles. He also worked on the first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus. ""She was a beautiful ship,"" and much larger than submarines of her time, he said. Korth held the rank of second class petty officer that he said was about equivalent to the Marine Corps staff sergeant. Case, who has lived in Muskego most of his life, enlisted in the Navy in 1948 and was serving on an isolated island in the Aleutians when the Korean War broke out in 1950. He normally would have been rotated out of the unappealing assignment, but the war froze everyone at their posts. Case served on Adak island, Alaska, for 27 months of rain and clouds and drear. He was attached to a construction battalion known by the general name of CBs, providing support for the military base there. When he finally got off the island, he served aboard the destroyer USS Stembel that took part in a bombardment of North Korean positions. ""One day we fired all day long,"" said Case who served on deck and was hit by that noise for hour after hour. The ship was reassigned almost immediately to San Diego, then Long Beach and then San Francisco where it was transformed into a submarine killer, Case said. ""We followed the fleet all over the North Pacific and then Formosa,"" he said. Case was on the Honor Flight with his grandson, James Case, who served in the Air Force and is a Gulf War veteran. James also lives in Muskego and is an assistant fire chief in Wauwatosa and served as his grandfather's ""guardian"" on the trip. ""He was great,"" said the elder serviceman who was proud of his grandson. His two favorite parts of the visit were the statue of the flag being raised over Iwo Jima, ""I felt overwhelmed,"" and the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown. The precision achieved by the guards was breath-taking, Case said. For Korth, the most moving part of the visit was the Korean War Memorial, a tableau of some 19 life size and lifelike soldiers walking while on the lookout for the enemy. Korth's daughter, Tracy Snead, his trip guardian, noticed that regardless of where you were, eyes were always on you, Korth said. Nothing, however, prepared the veterans for their homecoming. The 187 veterans on the Honor Flight were greeted by thousands of people cheering, waving, and shouting, ""God bless you,"" at Mitchell Airport. ""Our eyes just popped,"" Korth said. ""Tracy and I both started to cry."" And in the massive crowd he spotted not only family but members of the Muskego Lions Club and his church, Atonement Lutheran, he said. Before they even reached the hoopla in the main part of the airport, the veterans walked or were wheeled through a column of honor with some 200 servicemen and women from all branches in uniform saluting them. ""It was super-moving,"" Korth said. Case, too, was overwhelmed. ""It was beyond belief,"" he said. The Honor Flight meant much to both of them. ""No words can describe,"" Case said. ""It was the most exciting and outstanding thing that ever happened in my life except my children being born,"" Korth said. We welcome reader discussion but strive to keep things civil.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/117397041/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Civil-rights-groups-oppose-King-monument-at-Confederate-site/,"ATLANTA — A civil rights group co-founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is saying ""no"" to a memorial for him at Stone Mountain. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Atlanta and DeKalb branches of the NAACP said Tuesday that they oppose placing a tribute to King near the figures of three Confederate leaders engraved on the mountain outside Atlanta. Leaders of the organizations said they will meet Wednesday with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal to discuss the issue. The state has OK'd a plan to place a bell at the top of Stone Mountain in honor of King's call in 1963 to ""let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia"" during his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The head of the SCLC says that instead, he wants Confederate symbols gone from Stone Mountain. USA TODAY Early recording found of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I have a dream' speech ""I'm not in agreement with that,” said Charles Steele Jr., president and CEO of the SCLC. ""I don't think it should be at Stone Mountain. We are in support of all symbols of the Confederacy to be removed throughout this country."" Members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans have also said they don't think Stone Mountain is an appropriate place to honor King's civil rights legacy. Stone Mountain is, by state law, designated as a Confederate memorial. The carving is the largest relief sculpture in the world, beating out Mount Rushmore. Critics repeatedly have called for removing the images of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, General Robert E. Lee and General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson on horseback, and renewed those efforts following June’s mass shooting that killed nine members of a historic black church in Charleston, S.C.

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123115/why-bernie-sanders-lost-debate,"Bernie Sanders had a big test at the first Democratic debate: to prove that he could broaden his appeal enough to be a genuine threat to Hillary Clinton for the nomination. While the Vermont senator has made recent gains in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he’s still more than 20 points behind her on average—and that’s with Joe Biden listed as an option and drawing support from Clinton. After Sanders' poll numbers rose sharply in the summer, he's plateaued, stuck in the mid-20s. That raises the question of how much higher he can really go, especially with Clinton's sizable advantages among women and voters of color. Though he had some memorable moments that lit up Twitter on Tuesday, the debate revealed why the political instincts that have fired the progressive base could ultimately keep him from breaking through to the rest of the party. Clearly, Bernie's gonna be Bernie. The debate showed why his fans are so passionate about him: Sanders is at his best when he’s going on the offensive—against the big banks, Wall Street, and the “millionaires and billionaires” who are funding elections. But the debate also forced him to go on the defensive, pushing him out of his comfort zone, and on those occasions, Sanders simply muddled through. Those responses spoke to his limitations as a candidate whose greatest strength and greatest weakness is his singular focus on anti-corporate economic populism. Even before the most recent mass shooting in Oregon, it was clear that gun control would be Sanders’s biggest vulnerability, as it’s one of the few issues where he’s consistently been more conservative than Clinton. But his response to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper—who pointed out his vote against the Brady bill to mandate background checks—showed none of the ideological clarity that undergirds his economic vision. He started off with an awkward reference to himself in the third person, citing his D-minus rating from the NRA. But his main fallback was his parochialism, repeatedly citing the fact that he comes from a “rural state” with different views on gun control rather than providing any ideological explanation or argument for his pro-gun votes. When Martin O’Malley tried to push him on the issue, saying it “was not about rural and urban,” Sanders stubbornly repeated the same talking points: “It’s exactly about rural,” he said, then trotted out the line about his “D minus record” from the NRA again. Sanders repeated the same pattern on other issues, providing patchy answers to questions outside of his purview. Perhaps his most underwhelming moment during the debate was the discussion on foreign policy, which rarely features in his big speeches. When he was asked to weigh in on former Senator Jim Webb’s vendetta against China, he seemed to be caught unawares. “Pardon me?” he said. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper repeated the question, he launched into an argument that Putin, somehow, would end up regretting his decision to send Russian troops into Syria. Cooper nearly laughed, it seemed, responding: “He doesn’t seem to be the type of guy to regret anything,” he said. But Sanders continued pursuing the same logic, arguing that Putin was already regretting his decision to intervene in Ukraine and Crimea. That would ultimately lead Putin to come around, he said, because “the Russian people are going to give him a message,” without explaining how a leader who’s been so intractable would end up changing his tune and suddenly be willing to collaborate on a non-military solution with the U.S. Sanders didn’t get to explaining how he would lead the U.S. effort differently in Syria until later in the debate when he asked point blank about the issue. It was a prime opportunity for him to slam Clinton for her hawkish foreign policy views; she’s far more eager than President Obama to use military force in places like Syria. But Sanders largely declined to take the opening, despite having put out a press release this weekend spotlighting his anti-war views. At the debate, he laid out his policy positions, denouncing the war in Iraq as “the worst blunder in the history of the country” and opposing ground troops in Syria; he delivered a passing shot at Clinton's support of a no-fly zone over Syria. But he mostly avoided using his dovish positions to tackle Clinton’s hawkishness head on, even though it’s one of the areas where the next president will matter the most, as my colleague Jeet Heer explained. Clinton, by contrast, took a direct jab at Sanders: After saying he did not support ground trips in Syria, she swiftly interrupted the moderator to interject, ""Nobody does, Senator Sanders."" Those moments in the debate seem to reflect the fact that Sanders is still a candidate who views politics through a single prism—and doesn’t care as much about what falls outside of it. That disinterest was evident even before the debate began: He barely spent any time preparing, and his campaign aides essentially had to push him into it. The one issue on which Sanders has been forced to stretch himself during the campaign has been on criminal justice reform and racial inequality, but it took major public missteps before he began talking about the issues outside of the economic inequality lens. He had better answers to the questions raised by the Black Lives Matter this time—but he'd been forced many times before to prepare for them. Essentially, the debate seemed to confirm that Sanders isn’t interested in stretching himself as a candidate for the sake of broader political appeal. That’s exactly why his supporters love him so much: He is a true believer who believes that “the casino capitalist process” has corrupted the country and is unwavering in his focus on the issue. And that message is having an undeniable impact on the Democratic primary. This debate opened with a discussion between Sanders and Clinton of “Democratic Socialism,"" and the merits of capitalism—subjects that would never have arisen without Sanders in the field. But his moments of weakness in the debate also suggested that he doesn't have the political instincts or the appetite to court voters on issues outside of those policy priorities. And Bernie, being Bernie, would probably consider that a compliment.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2494849/600-kids-skip-school-to-avoid-potential-incident-by-suicidal-teen/,"600 kids skipped school after suicide notes were found in bathrooms. The mass absence occurred on Friday, which accounts for about 20 percent of Hoover High School's 2,950 students. The incident is being linked to students at other schools and colleges who killed themselves after opening fire on school campuses. As the Associated Press reported, the suicide notes were found earlier last week and turned into police. It took authorities some time before finally locating the troubled student, but that did not prevent 600 kids from not showing up for class. The notes were left in bathrooms on all three floors of the school building. The notes indicated a student would kill himself on October 9, the same day 600 kids decided to skip school.  Police and school officials pored over video footage to pinpoint the writer of the notes since they were discovered. The process was indeed time-consuming, as they had to view many hours of surveillance footage multiple times. They were finally able to identify the student, who confessed upon being approached by police. Police were unsure if this was designed as a prank to cause panic in the school or if the student really was intent on doing something to himself. Despite being identified by Thursday, 600 students still skipped school on Friday with the support of their parents, who feared the worst. But after no incident occurred, Hoover Police Department spokesman, Captain Gregg Rector, tried to calm the school community, as reported by AL.com.

Captain Rector commended and praised the excellent coordination between his department and the school community, AL.com reported.   AL.com also reported Rector's statement of understanding towards the 600 kids who skipped school and the entire school community.   Fears are high in the country only two weeks after the mass shooting at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon. A 26-year-old student shot students and staff of the college before turning the gun on himself after police arrived. Survivors of that incident are still coming forward with their stories. The gunman, Chris Harper Mercer, was said to have been inspired by earlier school shootings in evidence he left behind. Neither school officials nor police blamed the 600 kids for skipping school. Whether 600 kids or the entire student body, nobody wants another incident of mass school violence. If an incident was to occur, 600 or more kids skipping school would have made the situation easier to control for law enforcement officials. [Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images]"
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/uTLiP9sB5W8/,"The jury decision finding a Wisconsin gun seller liable for selling a firearm that was used to shoot two police officers is a rare legal victory for gun control advocates that could open a new front in the nation’s contentious fight over the right to bear arms. A jury on Tuesday held that Badger Guns, a Milwaukee firearms seller, was liable for the wounding of two Milwaukee police officers in 2009 after it sold a gun to a straw purchaser, who bought the weapon on behalf of someone else. The gun was purchased by 21-year-old Jacob Collins and given to 18-year-old Julius Burton, who was too young to buy a firearm. One month later, Burton shot and wounded officers Bryan Norberg and Graham Kunisch. Burton is now serving 80 years in prison while Collins spent two years behind bars. Until recently, few cases have held gun dealers responsible for selling a firearm linked to a crime. Only two have reached a jury since 2005, when Congress passed the Protection for Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which provides broad immunity for gun sellers and was strongly supported by the National Rifle Association. Earlier this summer, a similar lawsuit found that an Alaska gun seller was not liable for a firearm it had sold that was later used in a 2006 murder. But about 10 other lawsuits are currently in the works, including another suit against Badger Guns brought by two other Milwaukee officers who were shot with guns bought from the store, says Jonathan Lowy, the director of legal action at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. And the Milwaukee ruling could open the door for even more. “Litigation is one of the most promising avenues to save lives,” Lowy said. “Any victory that’s achieved in court is going to inspire and help the movement to prevent gun violence, and this latest victory is certainly a very important one.” The Brady Campaign has filed suits in Indiana, New York, Pennsylvania and Florida in cases involving straw purchases. The suits come at a time of increased attention on the federal law that grants gun sellers broad protections from liability. Since the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College on Oct. 1 that left 10 dead, Hillary Clinton has said she would work to repeal PLCAA if elected president. “Does this lawsuit immediately make it easy to sue a gun dealer?” said Adam Skaggs, senior counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group. “No. But I think it’s focused people’s attention on this federal immunity law. And we’ll continue to see lawsuits because it’s not an uncommon occurrence that these sorts of sales occur within a small percentage of rogue gun dealers that don’t follow the law.” The tactic will face another significant test in an upcoming case in Missouri. The Brady Center is suing a Missouri pawn shop that sold a gun to Colby Sue Weathers, who shot and killed her father after her mother called the store and asked it not to sell her daughter a firearm. Weathers had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and previously purchased a gun with the intent to commit suicide. The Brady Center argues that the store was negligent in selling Weathers the firearm and is liable in her father’s death. The case will likely be heard in front of the Supreme Court of Missouri in early 2016. Due to the federal protections provided by the PLCAA, it can be difficult to prove the negligence of gun sellers. Plaintiffs have to prove that dealers knowingly sold a firearm to someone who is barred from owning a gun. In Alaska, plaintiffs were unable to show that Ray Coxe, a local gun dealer, knowingly sold a gun illegally to Jason Coday, who in 2006 placed $200 on a counter at Coxe’s gun store and left with a rifle. Coday, who would have failed a background check, later killed 26-year-old Simone Kim with the firearm, but Coxe wasn’t considered liable for his death. Contact us at letters@time.com."

Jerry Brown signed legislation this past weekend to restrict antibiotic use on livestock production, many future medical health professionals, like myself, breathed a sigh of relief. California has taken a revolutionary step forward in fighting the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens through better livestock management. Alexander Fleming, father of penicillin, warned of the ignorant use of antibiotics 87 years ago in fear of resistance. And his prediction turned out to be true, when up to 70 percent of antibiotics are indiscriminately used by livestock production today, running these superbugs into our food and water supply. Fortunately, SB 27 prohibits the routine use of antibiotics on animals that are not sick, allowing California to put to put health before profit. Phoebe Wong Nursing student CSU-East Bay Support Mandelkern for re-election to board Here’s why I’m recommending a vote for Dave Mandelkern for re-election to the governing board of the San Mateo County Community College District. Dave represents the kind of smart, pragmatic leadership we need to make sure our three local colleges (Cañada College, College of San Mateo and Skyline College) flourish and provide the best possible education for our local students. Experience matters, and Dave has proved that he can balance the district’s $100 million budget, having done so year after year as an elected trustee. His Silicon Valley business career gives him the leadership and management skills necessary to make sure our community college district is well run. And as a veteran myself, I am pleased that Dave has led the effort to make sure that we have resource centers at all three of our colleges to better meet the needs of our recently returned veteran soldiers. Please vote for Dave Mandelkern for trustee of the San Mateo County Community College District. Howard Hibbard Retired attorney Daly City Brown’s veto of Right to Try bill is puzzling Concerning Gov. Jerry Brown’s veto of Assembly Bill 159, the so-called Right to Try bill, it’s strange that he believes terminally ill people should have all their options to kill themselves, but those who want to live don’t deserve the same. He says we should rely on the FDA’s program to allow this to happen. Funny, he doesn’t want to rely on the federal standards when it comes issues such as marijuana or sanctuary cities. David Knoblich San Jose Poll shows Sanders  not so far left after all So reporter Josh Richman (“Democrats set for a no-frills policy debate,” Oct. 13) writes, “It’s the burgeoning Bernie Sanders’ chance to expand his populist, socialist message beyond his mostly white, far-left base.” Well, just how far out are Bernie’s views? Not at all, in fact. According to a poll of likely voters conducted Jan. 9-15 by GBA Strategies on behalf of the Progressive Change Institute: Seventy percent support expansion of Social Security benefits; so does Bernie; 71 percent support Medicare buy-in for all; so does Bernie; 71 percent support debt-free college at all public universities; so does Bernie; 77 percent support universal prekindergarten; so does Bernie; 66 percent support transparency in trade negotiations; so does Bernie; 70 percent support the closing of offshore corporate tax loopholes; so does Bernie; 71 percent support an infrastructure jobs program; so does Bernie; 58 percent support breaking up the big banks; so does Bernie; 61 percent support ensuring net neutrality; so does Bernie. Bud Childress San Jose NRA using gun owners to leverage its clout John Rosselott (Letters, Oct. 13) wants to challenge the notion that “dues-paying members of the NRA are financing mass murder in America.” While the NRA may clamor for the rights of an individual to own guns, it is clearly a lobbying cabal that supports and promotes the gun manufacturing industry. Let’s not forget that immediately following the mass shooting at Columbine High School, the NRA organized a big gun rally in Denver to defeat any effort by lawmakers to introduce even common-sense gun laws. The NRA has no conscience and is simply using law-abiding gun owners to leverage its clout. If you send money to the NRA, then you are supporting its agenda. Jerry Gudeman Santa Clara Silicon Valley firms need to honor privacy I completely agree (Editorial, Oct. 13) that there should be a stricter level of security concerning people’s private information.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/15/letters-20151015/,"On credible paranoia I read Rebecca Woodard's letter to the editor on Philip Martin's Sunday column. Out of what is essentially his capitulation to the fact that we are now a nation controlled by the gun lobby and gun culture, Ms. Woodard laser-focused on his statements about the visceral pleasures offered by the piece of metal itself, suggesting he might have a little problem going on in his head. I'm sorry, but I think her extracting and addressing just those statements from the entire piece says as much about the observer as what is observed. She goes on to suggest he return to the ""irrelevant"" field of movie reviewing, thereby attacking him again at the personal level. Though she doesn't say it, I'm thinking she must be threatened by his ideas on why we find ourselves, as a nation, under the iron grip of a weapons culture. Several times in the column Martin was clear that he believes in the individual's right to own and use guns, but also reminding us that it comes with at least a minimum of responsibility. Maybe that is what Ms. Woodard objects to. The idea that there should be any restraints on anything having to do with guns, because, as Martin says, even though most people may not really believe the government is coming to take their guns, some just don't want to take any chances. I think Martin summed it up very well when he wrote, ""I don't even think guns are our biggest problem. Our biggest problem is that weird American propensity for finding the paranoid credible, for attending to the darkest tuggings of our nature. The great American vice is our susceptibility to irrational fear."" You could drop the term ""American"" out of that paragraph and pretty much describe what's wrong with a lot of our world. You win, Ms. Woodard; take a victory lap. JEFFERY REDDEKOPP Fayetteville Common-sense laws The recent New York Times op-ed about who the NRA is protecting is not the first time I've heard that the ATF is prohibited by Congress from cross-checking multiple gun purchases in a short time frame. It's called possible gun trafficking. Of course it seems we can now say that the Second Amendment protects gun trafficking because that's always the excuse the extremists say when we try for reasonable gun laws. And I said reasonable, common-sense laws. STEVE WHEELER North Little Rock Game of capitalism The Perspective essay by Marcia Angell on medication costs should be required reading for everyone. American drug companies charge us outrageous prices for many drugs and are a major force in driving up the cost of health care. They face no impediment to charging us whatever prices they want to. This is unbridled capitalism run amok. We will never get relief from our legislators since it seems they are comfortably in the pocket of Big Pharma. Only we consumers can effect change. Some of us are doing just that by turning to reputable international pharmacies, especially those in Canada. These pharmacies will sell drugs to us directly at a fraction of what we pay in the U.S. In many cases we can buy generic drugs that Big Pharma won't allow to be produced in the U.S. The Canadian pharmacies have excellent websites. They have telephone and fax numbers that we can dial directly. A real person will answer the phone and give assistance. They do require prescriptions. Big Pharma loves unbridled capitalism. We consumers can play that game, too. SANDY WYLIE Bella Vista My simple solution I propose an easy fix to the issue of which chemicals to use in administering the death penalty. Let an anesthesiologist administer the same drug they use to put us under when undergoing a medical procedure, and then administer the heart-stopping drug. The criminal should have no idea of what's happening, just like we don't when we are put under. Kind of simple, isn't it? PETE RATHMELL Garfield Whose lives' precious Pro-life means birth to death. Pro-life is not just pre-birth. Pro-life means all life is precious, as we hear presidential candidates declare ... when referring to abortion. But after a mass shooting like in Oregon, Jeb Bush says ""stuff happens."" Really? Stuff happens? What happened to all life is precious? Birth to death? What a bunch of hypocrites. They don't care about any of us ... unless we're rich and contribute to their political campaigns. They don't care that 87,000 people, that we know of, have died because of guns since the Sandy Hook shootings. The NRA has become the lobbying arm of the weapons manufacturers, and they represent a very small portion of the American people. A large majority of the people want expanded background-check/gun-control laws, across party lines, and many of them responsible gun owners and NRA members. We are ignored. We only hear from the extremists, not the rational people about gun control and regulations. We regulate many of our constitutional rights, such as the First Amendment. No one apparently worries about the Fourth Amendment because the NSA tramples all over that one, and on and on, so why the Second? It seems the NRA purposely leaves out an important part of the Second Amendment--""A well-regulated militia."" Last week, two more shootings within hours of each other. One at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, a school my granddaughter attends, and then within hours at Texas Southern University. The U.S. reportedly has 31 percent of all mass shootings on Earth. JUDITH K. ZITKO Hot Springs Village The blame misplaced There's a younger generation maturing today while immersed in a culture of extreme violence. Take a look at the absolute garbage Hollywood passes off as entertainment. Not only is that violence considered normal today, but thanks to technology, the blood, guts and gore are horrifically realistic. Then take a look at the savagery of the most popular video games that young kids and young adults squander every free moment with. They see it, do it and live it every day. Add to the mix a culture where the nuclear family is rapidly dissolving, and kids have little if any parental guidance. And it seems those with traditional values who honor their religion and believe in strict morals and ethics are nothing more than targets of hatred for those who lack the same beliefs. Human life apparently is no longer considered sacred; 177 House Democrats just voted against legislation that would have defined the killing of an unsuccessfully aborted child as murder. Then we are bewildered when some deranged kid goes to a gun-free school zone where people can't protect themselves and they're shot to death like characters in a video game. Any gardener can tell you that a seed planted in toxic soil will produce a damaged, deformed and defective living organism. But blaming guns for this perversion is no different than blaming cars for drunk drivers.

Gavin Newsom on Thursday will introduce a measure for next year’s ballot that aims to stanch the proliferation of gun violence, including a provision to require ammunition buyers to undergo background checks. Newsom, a Democrat running for governor in 2018, will announce the measure in San Francisco, where he’ll be joined by co-authors from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, an organization that grew out of the mass shooting at 101 California St. in 1993. His measure, which requires nearly 366,000 signatures to qualify for next year’s ballot, incorporates provisions of bills that stalled at the state Capitol. It would ban the possession of large-capacity magazines – more than 10 rounds – and require anyone who currently has them to sell to a licensed firearm dealer, transfer them out of state or relinquish them to law enforcement to be disposed of. I can hear the, “look, this isn’t radical or new, we already confiscated certain magazines . . .” arguments already.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/K_GLJO0HG44/,"Gun ownership is once again at the center of public debate following another mass shooting. One self-described ""gun lover"" by the name of Mark Carman has made a major impression online after releasing an 11-minute message aimed at his fellow ""responsible gun owners."" Carman is hardly someone who identifies on the liberal side of the political spectrum. A self-described Evangelical Christian Republican (who was also a 2015 Grammy award nominee as a Christian music producer), Carman nonetheless felt compelled to speak out in the wake of the recent shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College.  In a clip posted both on his Facebook page and YouTube channel, Carman begins by holding a loaded gun up to the camera, asking the viewer if they are familiar with just what the weapon is. He goes on to say that he both owns and likes that particular gun, yet if he wanted to sell it to you, he could legally do so without any kind of background check. In fact, according to Carman, the transaction could legally take place between he and a total stranger while standing on his front porch. Carman goes on to say that we as a nation have a problem on our hands when it comes to gun ownership. Pointing out that he both loves firearms and is trained in their safe use (Carman was formerly a police officer in Norfolk, Virginia, as the Daily Press points out), he nonetheless asserts that policies need to be put into place to keep guns out of the hands of ""people who shouldn't have them.""

Carman advocates in the video for better screening policies and expresses his belief that firearms sales conducted without a background check should be made illegal. He directly references the double standard that forces brick-and-mortar gun stores to conduct background checks, while private sales aren't subject to such regulation. As Reverb Press points out, buying guns online or at gun shows are also effective methods for circumventing background checks in most states.   — Gun Control (@GunContRRol) September 27, 2015  — Gun Control (@GunContRRol) September 27, 2015  Carman goes on to directly tackle some of the arguments surrounding Second Amendment rights, asserting that the establishment of basic rules governing the use and ownership of guns isn't an infringement of those rights. Comparing gun ownership to car and plane operation, Carman suggests that not only licensing requirements, but also written and practical tests used to prove competence should be implemented, and perhaps even required on an ongoing basis. Carman also tackles arguments advanced by some who wish to prevent government representatives from knowing they own a firearm. If you have a membership at a gun range, a hunting license, or a concealed weapons permit, Carman points out that federal and state authorities almost certainly already know that you are a gun owner.

In his video, however, Carman challenges others who see themselves as responsible gun owners to consider their opinions toward legal safeguards surrounding firearms.   In the finale of his video, Carman points out that no legislation will be able to stop every mass shooting or act of terror. He challenges the assertion, however, that such legislation would be without a point or justification.   After the video was posted, it quickly went viral on Facebook.

http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/16/a-new-manhunt-for-secretive-firm-that-tracked-bin-laden.html," When a $38,000 Infinity SUV went missing in League City, Texas, in  March, police discovered a post of the missing keys on  29-year-old Christoffer Andrew Lee's Facebook page — with  his location tagged. Texas police saw the post and arrested  him. It's become a core activity for law enforcement and governments  to use online histories and social media to track crimes —  after they occur. But the issue becomes more dicey when social  media is being used to catch a criminal before they act. The recent shooting in Oregon is a prime example. The shooter and  his mother had a history of online posts and social media that  were discovered after the fact and that, in the least, suggested  cause for concern. The shooter, Chris Harper-Mercer, had  a social media profile that expressed frustration with  organized religion and that he had studied mass shootings.  He lived with his mother, who wrote online about her passion  for firearms. Does that qualify as evidence? Could it have led to preemptive  action by law enforcement? As law enforcement uses insights from  predictive data analytics and firms like Palantir Technologies  — a billion-dollar-plus Silicon Valley and CIA-backed firm  whose claim to fame is the role it reportedly played in catching  Osama bin Laden — it is hunting along a slippery slope of  privacy rights and potentially using a less-than-perfect science  to indict members of society for their words alone rather than  deeds. ""There's a treasure trove of information available on social  media when it comes to not only criminal-based activities but  also terrorist-based activities,"" said Jon Miller, a former  hacker who now serves as vice president of strategy at Cylance, an antivirus software maker. ""The posted threats, though nonspecific, probably provided enough  of a predicate to warrant law-enforcement investigations, which  it sounds like were under way,"" said Bryan Cunningham,  senior counsel at Palantir Technologies. Law-enforcement agencies and intelligence and security services  around the world have been taking note. In 2014 the  International Association of Chiefs of Police conducted its fifth  annual survey on law enforcement's use of social media. Surveying  600 agencies in 46 states, the research found that the most  common use of social media is for criminal investigations (82.3  percent). Meanwhile, it found the most frequently used social  media platforms are Facebook (95.4 percent), Twitter (66.4  percent) and YouTube (38.5 percent). In 2011 the New York Police Department formed a unit to track  criminals who brag about their crimes on Twitter, MySpace and Facebook. And in March 2013,  following the fatal attack of a soldier in London, an  intelligence unit within London's Metropolitan Police Service  focused on tracking social media feedback and monitoring  community tension. ""I think that social media gives huge insight into the mental  instability of desperate people,"" Miller said. ""As a society, we  should use our advances in machine learning and big data  analytics to identify these people that are in need of help before tragedies, like the latest Oregon shooting, occur."" Michael Levine, a law-enforcement consultant and retired Drug  Enforcement Administration agent, said social media should be  used as an investigative tool and, in the best-case scenario, to  obtain probable cause for a search warrant. But he also sees  major limitations on its usefulness in the legal system. ""Both the Oregon shooter and his mother had a history of social  media posts, which shed light on the buildup toward the tragedy.  However, before the shooting, there was no court-worthy evidence  that the mere participation in social media played a causative  role in any mass shooting,"" Levine said. Levine added that after a crime, it's different. ""Once a shooting has  occurred, an investigator can find court-worthy evidence of other  people playing a criminal role and aiding and abetting and/or  encouraging the act; sufficient evidence to indict."" But he added  that as a career criminal investigator, trial consultant and  expert witness, he saw no logical or causative relationship that  would be acceptable as ""evidence"" by a court in the specific case  of the Oregon shooting. In the least, social media is creating a host of challenges for  law enforcement. The sheer volume of digital evidence to wade  through, for one, and the consequential ""false positives"" that  arise as a result. Many legal experts note that social media is  uncovering new ethical challenges surrounding privacy. While  public posts are fair game for investigators, privacy advocates  are quick to point out that just because content of a post is  public, it doesn't give government the right to then listen in on  phone calls and have access to more private information. According to  data from industry researcher eMarketer, there will be more than 2  billion social network users worldwide by the end of 2015. That  amounts to 28.2 percent of the total worldwide population and  nearly two-thirds of Internet users around the world. eMarketer  expects an increase in global social media use of 9.3 percent in  2015 and 8.8 percent in 2016. The Palantir lawyer sees the difficulty of reconciling  law-enforcement aims with privacy rights. ""The father in me  wishes police had the resources, and we had a society, where the  Internet could be monitored for those types of postings, but the  civil libertarian in me says we don't want the kind of society  where the government is looking everywhere, all the time, without  any predicates, even if such activity could prevent some horrific  acts like this one."" Too often, according to law-enforcement and security experts, the  approach of using social media in fighting crime has been an  afterthought, and specifically, after the fact. That approach,  some security experts claim, is largely the result of poor  training, insufficient software and a lacking understanding of  how valuable social media actually is. The former hacker Miller has built a career putting himself  inside the minds of criminals to test the vulnerabilities of  Fortune 500 companies — a career that's made him well aware  that having a system of searching, mining and storing data on  specific users from social media is imperative to tracking  criminal activity. ""One of the problems today is that the way  most law-enforcement units use social media is ad hoc. There  aren't a lot of forensic standards,"" he said. Criminals, for example, often use social media to brag about what  they did to their friends. Case in point: In 2013 in Florida,  31-year-old Derek Medina allegedly confessed on Facebook to  murdering his 26-year-old wife. He also posted a photo of her  body covered in bullets. Miller predicts that in five to 10 years, ""machine learning"" will  take a more active role in how law enforcement and governments  police social media activity, ""before something bad happens.""  This doesn't necessarily mean catching the Oregon shooter —  it means using that shooter's history of posts to help build a  data set that would inform the ongoing hunt for future  criminals. ""Ideally, when somebody goes out and does something like a  shooting, you'd be able to plug that user's social media presence  into a machine to say, 'These types of posts can lead to this type  of event' … and then the machine would perform large-scale  psychological profiling on the public,"" Miller said. ""It's  all going to be done with the motivation of making the world a  safer place, but it's all going to be incredibly invasive."" Similar to Waze, the GPS navigation app Google acquired in 2013,  which collects metrics on where people are at all times, various  tools are already on the market to do just that. These tools  essentially plug in swaths of social media feeds into a machine  capable of processing contextual history, using machine learning  to look for trends and patterns and perform large-scale  statistical analysis. Start-up company Five Labs has a similar online tool that it  claims can analyze Facebook posts to assess  personality. ZeroFox.com, the cybersecurity start-up that monitors social media  networks, sells products that it says can help identify internal  and external threats to an organization. Palantir's Cunningham believes the likelihood of  success is greater, and privacy and civil liberties less risky,  with predicate-based analysis than with the bulk collection  of social media data. For example, getting warrants for and analyzing the social media  and more sensitive data of a gang member posting a photo of the  property he just stole on Facebook is more effective and poses  little risk to the privacy of innocent people, he said. On the  other hand, large-scale, bulk analysis to identify potential  terrorists, according to Cunningham, while perhaps sometimes  necessary, is more fraught with privacy concerns and its  effectiveness is more difficult to pinpoint. He said additional resources should be devoted to refining  analytical technology to reduce the number of false positives and  false negatives and provide additional privacy protections. Based on current technology, the privacy and civil liberties  concerns are significant enough with bulk social media analysis  that law enforcement should only use it to combat the gravest  threats, like smuggling nuclear devices into the U.S. Even then,  Cunningham said, it should be done with a careful eye toward  protecting privacy and civil liberties. Experts hope that over time, the use of social media to respond  to, fight and prevent crime will make law-enforcement and  security protection activities more effective and, at the same  time, privacy- protective. ""The hope is that that the conversation evolves from 'catching  criminals' on social media to following and analyzing indicators  of instability based on past behavior — before those people  actually go out and perpetuate crimes,"" Miller said.

Two new suspects were identified in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York. And how the paparazzi machine was no match for social media, celebrity revolt and the Great Recession. By
      
        BuzzFeed News Posted on October 16, 2015, at 11:30 a.m. ET HERE ARE THE TOP STORIES This means Obama will not be able to end the 14-year war in Afghanistan before leaving office, as he previously planned. “Afghan forces are still not as strong as they need to be,” Obama said during an announcement at the White House yesterday. The 9,800 American troops in Afghanistan right now will stay there through most of 2016. After that, at least 5,500 troops will remain at key bases throughout the country. “The decision underlines the growing opinion among military leaders that the Afghan authorities need additional help in dealing with a renewed wave of Taliban attacks,” BuzzFeed News’ Francis Whittaker and Jessica Simeone write. Obama speaks during a joint press conference with his Afghan counterpart at the White House, March 2015. And a little extra. The Taliban has been targeting women especially. Last month, when the Taliban conquered Kunduz, a strategic northern city, it “relentlessly hounded women with any sort of public profile, looted a high school, and destroyed the offices of many of the organizations that protected and supported women in Kunduz,” the New York Times writes. As a result, a large number of educated women fled the city, many of whom have no intention of ever coming back. And for more context: Some lessons from pulling out of Iraq in 2011 may have influenced Obama’s decision to keep troops in Afghanistan, according to The New York Times. Here’s an overview of the Taliban’s hold over Afghanistan. And this graphic shows how Obama’s plans in Afghanistan have changed over time. WE’RE KEEPING AN EYE ON The pact, to which the EU leaders have decided to pledge “political support,” hopes to keep more than two million Syrian refugees in Turkey where they currently are, preventing them from traveling through to Europe, the Guardian writes. In return for Turkey’s help, the EU is considering offering the country roughly $3.4 million, quicker visa-free travel to EU countries for Turkey’s more than 75 million citizens, and the unfreezing of talks about the country’s membership to the EU, BuzzFeed News’ Francis Whittaker writes. Refugees arrive in Lesbos, Greece, after crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey in September. What’s next? No deal has actually been struck and diplomats are saying the money Turkey asked for isn’t available. The EU leaders are continuing talks with Turkey on the topic over the coming days. There’s also “much resistance among national leaders to fast-tracking visa waivers for the Turks,” the Guardian writes.

Two new Libyan suspects were named in the 1988 Lockerbie plane bombing case, which remains unsolved. “The announcement is the latest twist in the one of the most infamous terrorist attacks in modern history,” BuzzFeed News’ Tom Namako and Rossalyn Warren write. Scottish and American prosecutors are looking to interrogate the new suspects in the 27-year-old terrorist attack known as the Lockerbie bombing. Remains of Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed in the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 after it was bombed. The case is still open. On December 21, 1988, the transatlantic Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York was destroyed by a bomb. Parts of the plane’s remains crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 people on board were killed in the attack and 11 people were killed by the crashing parts. Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted of the bombing in 2001 and released eight years later on compassionate grounds after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Al-Megrahi died in 2012. What’s next? This new breakthrough in the case comes a few days after the release of a documentary by filmmaker Ken Dornstein, whose brother died in the bombing. In his documentary — My Brother’s Bomber, a three-part series — Dornstein tracks down two people who were suspected to be involved with the attack. Both are still alive in Libya, according to PBS. Other family members of the victims told BuzzFeed News they’re glad American and Scottish officials are still investigating the case, but that they’re still looking for the whole truth about what happened. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? David Stojcevski died in a Michigan jail after being sentenced to serve 30 days for unpaid traffic tickets. Documents obtained by BuzzFeed News suggest the judge who locked him up violated the law by failing to assess if he was too poor to pay his fines. Jail time for people who can’t afford to pay their fines is gaining scrutiny. Critics are saying the practice is a “modern day debtor’s prison,” BuzzFeed News writes. A recent BuzzFeed News investigation found that Texas municipal judges send people to jail because they can’t afford to pay their traffic tickets, something that’s against state law and a disaster to those who are already struggling.

WEEKEND READS Our special guest this week is Annie-Rose Strasser, the managing editor for BuzzFeed News. There's something purely joyful in Miranda July's interview with Rihanna. You can tell how giddy July is to be doing the interview. As the reader, you feel anxious about getting Rihanna to like July and, by the transitive property, you. And then it happens. And Rihanna is just as wonderful as you think she'll be. It's pure pleasure to read this piece. In this piece, Mother Jones' Mark Follman takes what's become standard operating procedure for a mass shooting — potential warning signs, then an attack, then horror and heartbreak, then calls for action — and inverses it. He explores the world in which experts are trying to prevent mass shootings instead of reacting to them. Foreign Policy went to the Kunduz hospital accidentally bombed by the United States, and got a harrowing exclusive look at the skeletal remains of both the building and its inhabitants. This is a picture of war as we never want to see it. Wealth in politics is hard to envision, unless you do a fantastic job illustrating it, as this New York Times piece does. Using Monopoly pieces (monopoly — get it?), the authors give you visual cues to understand what it means that 158 families have spent $176 million so far on this year's election.

(You may remember her from when she met the late actor Robin Williams in 2001) For her most recent birthday, she got to meet some baby kittens and play with them. Other than making you feel all the feelings, the footage is meant to raise awareness that gorillas are endangered creatures that need protection. But grab some tissues, because you still might cry.

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/118059551/0/cincinnati-communities~Can-changing-school-culture-increase-safety/,"Trajectory, the path of an object in motion, can be changed by alterations in the environment or circumstance. The trajectory of Mark Barden’s life was changed Dec. 14, 2012, when the biggest fear of most parents, the death of a child, struck home in horrific fashion. All childhood death is tragic, but Barden’s son Daniel’s death at age 7 was a tragedy that touched people all over the world. He, 19 classmates and six educators were murdered in a classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Barden has been admittedly obsessed with trajectory and how to alter it ever since. He told parents at a symposium sponsored by the Northwest Local School District that not a day goes by that he doesn’t think about the day his son died, and what could have interrupted the path of the shooter to prevent him from carrying out his plan. “I run through what happened and I replay the different opportunities and places where something could have intervened,” he said. “All the way to that day, when he was on the way to the school, he could have been pulled over, gotten a flat tire, had an accident...something that would have stopped the continuum. That’s what we need to do: stop the continuum before it ends in violence and tragedy.” Barden is the director of the Sandy Hook Promise, a national nonprofit group led by several family members whose loved ones were killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. SHP is focused on preventing gun violence and all violence before it happens through mental health and wellness programs that identify, intervene and help individuals at-risk or socially isolated. Sandy Hook Promise is rolling out a national program, Say Something, to give students skills that can help interrupt the trajectory of tragedies like Sandy Hook with a simple plan: The message is easy for students to remember. Three steps: 1. Look for warning signs, signals or threats. 2. Act immediately. Take it seriously. 3. Say something to a trusted adult. Pleasant Run students will participate in Sandy Hook’s “Say Something” program during National Say Something Week Oct. 19-23. According to SHP’s literature, research shows that in seven out of 10 acts of gun violence, friends were told that an act of violence would be committed or might take place. It was reported that in four out of five school shootings, the attacker had told someone his plans ahead of time. But no one took action to prevent the plans. “Say Something,” an awareness program, tells teachers and students who to recognize signs of a potential threat, how to teach and instill in participants how to take action, and how to communicate the threat to others. Say Something hopes to help schools build a culture of awareness and help students understand what to look for on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat and other apps that could be indicators that someone is considering harming themselves or someone else. Pleasant Run Middle School counselor Jen Daly says parents or trusted adults have a responsibility to take student reports seriously and take action. “They can contact school counselors or the police,” she said. “But if students are going to report, we have to be the next step. Daly’s school has a club, Beyond Differences for students who have agreed to fight social isolation through a number of initiatives, such as SHP’s “No One Eats Alone” program. Students commit to take the initiative to sit with other students and invite them to join in activities during lunch recess and in school project groups. Hannah Harris, who has been the new girl at school, says she understands it can be uncomfortable to make new friends. She joined Beyond Differences because she says she wants to be that person that makes a difference to others. Natilee Vogt agreed, saying it feels good when you reach out to make others feel comfortable. Amanda Sturgis says it’s important to be genuine when you sit down with others. Airuanna Lewis says if the person sitting down with you isn’t genuinely interested in you, it wouldn’t feel too good. “You can tell when someone wants to know you and is interested in being friends,” she said. Daly is planning a week of events to support the training students will receive in assemblies this week. Some of the projects will include a music video created by students. There will be displays, an opportunity to sign a pledge to Say Something, and an opportunity for students to come up with ideas to overcome social isolation and bullying at the middle school. “I love to see this coming from our students,” she said. “We will continue finding ways to expand the programs.

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/ALICE-active-shooter-school-shooting-training-6572831.php," PICTURED: Uyesugi was a high school sharpshooter People called Greg Crane a crazy Texan in the early 2000s, when he suggested grade school students be educated to take down an active shooter themselves. It was a controversial proposal for the former Texas cop to make. But since then, America's epidemic of random mass shooters has only grown; of 166 fatal incidents tallied worldwide since 2000, 133 were in the United States. Now thousands of law enforcement agencies, schools and religious places are using Crane's program, called ALICE, which upends traditional wisdom of an active shooter lockdown, and teaches students an active response. RELATED: Should mass shooters be identified? 'Don't Name Them' movement growing ""Everyone is taught to remain passive and static,"" he said. ""That defense is not in line with the violence they're facing. There comes a time, unfortunately—and it's just life—where you have to respond yourself."" And Crane's convictions are apparent in modern national standards. A 2012 program called Run Hide Fight, produced jointly by the City of Houston and the Department of Homeland Security and promoted by the FBI, broke from shelter in place protocol, encouraging potential victims of an active shooter first to flee, then to take dynamic action and ""act with aggression"" if they encounter the aggressor. Kate Schweit senior executive program manager for the FBI's active shooter program, said national standards for both law enforcement and civilians have evolved through the last decade, as groups like the FBI have studied recurrent incidents. Instructing civilians for worst case scenarios--like coming face-to-face with an active shooter--can be uncomfortable but necessary. ""It is the reality of what we are seeing when we look at a situation,"" Schweit said. ""And we want people to discuss those things."" In 1999, Crane was a SWAT officer in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In the rare incident of an active shooter back then, law enforcement was trained to make a perimeter and wait for SWAT. But that was nixed that year after the massacre in Columbine High School, when police waited for 14 minutes for SWAT to arrive while shots were audible inside the school. After that, the first officer on the scene was trained to run to the gunfire. The change pressed Crane to ask his wife, an elementary school principal, how schools taught teachers and students to respond to a shooter on campus. Shelter in place, she told him. For Crane, a former security contractor in Kosovo and Texas sheriff's deputy, that didn't sit well. So he designed a program, premised on the notion that an active shooter needs an active response, even from grade school students, and that there's no time to hide and wait for police. RELATED: University system takes steps to ready for shooting response About six minutes elapsed between the moment a shooter opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, and the moment that he killed himself facing apprehension by police. In that time he killed 28 people with a semi-automatic rifle. Five years before at Virginia Tech, adults were shot dead while sitting on the ground, as lockdown drills instructed, when the gunman broke into a classroom. ""If someone is trying to hurt you with a firearm, that' probably the worst position to be in,"" Crane said. ""And it's the one we teach."" He said he talked with Virginia Tech survivors who told him they didn't know what to do when someone came in the classroom and started killing. ""It's time we know what to do,"" he said. RELATED: State-operated universities have active-shooter safety plans So he lives a life constantly on the road, traveling cross country from his Kerrville, Texas, home, training law enforcement instructors who go back to train schools or other groups in their communities. He gives four to six seminars a week, usually with 20 to 50 attendees, and has trained law enforcement at more than 2,000 independent school districts to date. (Click here to see ALICE training for elementary school students.) An active response doesn't mean running to the shooter—in fact it mostly means running away, which is not condoned in lockdown drills. But for the few who end up in close proximity to what Crane called ""a determined lunatic whose only mission is to try to hurt people,"" engaging is sometimes the only choice. ""The actual physical part of survival is not difficult, it's the mental part,"" Crane said. ""You condition people how to respond so that god forbid if they need to utilize those tools they have the tools in their mental toolbox."" The first tool: anything nearby. Throw paper, pens, desks or chairs. Scream at the shooter. Don't give them a chance to aim. RELATED: Timeline of American mass shootings Crane noted that law enforcement miss the vast majority of shots they take, and not because they are bad marksmen. High stress in the moment a weapon is pulled makes firing accurately very difficult. Victims make it easy for a shooter by staying quiet and still. Even if victims can't stop the suspect from pulling the trigger, Crane said, they can make it hard for them to aim. And in the closest encounter, Crane said students should be prepared for a physical takedown, where a crowd pelts the shooter with whatever they have, someone goes for the weapon (which they throw immediately to the floor) and others simultaneously cling to the limbs and neck. ""If we outnumber a guy 15 to one, he shouldn't be able to hurt us all,"" Crane said. ""Unless we just sit still."" So at ALICE school training events, instructors teach young students how to bring down a gunman,  if ever the need arises. But it's not just schools he helps instruct. He's had requests from malls, retails stores and hospitals. After the June massacre at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, Crane said he got a heavy uptick in training requests from religious institutions. ""Almost every demographic has unfortunately experienced one of these events now,"" he said. ""So every demographic is interested in how we can prepare.""

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/arts/~3/XciTomuzgkI/ct-highland-park-assault-weapons-ban-20151017-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has so far resisted elaborating on two landmark decisions that established a nationwide right to defend one's home with a gun. That could change with a new appeal filed by gun owners that challenges a suburb's assault weapons ban. The appeal by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that the city of Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition clips of more than 10 rounds. The justices put off consideration of the appeal last week. In recent years, the court has almost always deferred action on an appeal before agreeing to take it up. The court could say as early as Monday whether it will hear the case. Friedman is a practicing pediatrician and owner of semi-automatic weapons. He lost a bid for the state Senate as a Republican in 2012 in a campaign in which some conservatives complained about his support for abortion rights. In recent days, Friedman has used his Twitter account to offer tips for Israelis who want to arm themselves in public. He did not respond to messages left with his medical practice. The Supreme Court's 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller and the 2010 decision in McDonald v. Chicago focused mainly on the right to defend one's own home. Gun rights groups have failed repeatedly to get the justices to say how broadly the Second Amendment protects gun rights. The court has turned away challenges to gun laws at least three other times in cases that involved whether people have a right to be armed in public. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association. The city's assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision. ""If a ban on semi-automatic guns and large-capacity magazines reduces the perceived risk from a mass shooting and makes the public feel safer as a result, that's a substantial benefit,"" Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Conn., school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colo. In dissent, Judge Daniel Manion said individuals, not elected officials, get to choose which guns they prefer for self-defense. ""To limit self-defense to only those methods acceptable to the government"" creates an ""enormous transfer of authority from the citizens of this country to the government — a result directly contrary to our Constitution and to our political tradition,"" Manion wrote. Twenty-four states and other gun rights groups are supporting the appeal at the Supreme Court. The justices' refusal to say more about gun rights has allowed, even encouraged, federal judges to take a narrow view of the meaning of the Second Amendment, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on behalf of the states. ""It is time for this court to intervene."" The case is Friedman v. City of Highland Park, 15-133. Associated Press CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

At a town hall-style event Friday in Keene, N.H., Clinton was asked if she would consider the program, set up after a mass shooting, under which the Australian government bought back 650,000 guns and then imposed stricter purchase standards. ""I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged,"" Clinton said. She compared the mandatory Australian buyback, voluntary versions of which some communities in the United States have adopted, to President Barack Obama's Car Allowance Rebate System — ""cash for clunkers"" — which offered incentives to buy new cars and get energy-inefficient ones off the road. ""I do not know enough details to tell you how we would do it … but certainly your example is worth looking at,"" she said. In a statement, Chris Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said Clinton's comments validated gun owners' fears, and her ""extreme views are completely out of touch with the American people."" ""The real goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton, echoing Obama's recent remarks on the same issue, made that very clear."""

http://www.inquisitr.com/2505962/after-shooting-at-zombicon-gunman-eludes-police-and-family-mourns-young-victim/,"Expavious Tyrell Taylor and his girlfriend, Jasmine Gaure, had just arrived at Fort Myers' ZombiCon when Taylor became the latest victim of a mass shooting in the U.S. They had their backs to the street, waiting in line to get drinks a mere 45 minutes after arriving at the zombie-themed festival, when shots rang out and ""everybody ducked and ran,"" Jasmine told the Fort Myers News Press.  About 20,000 people were at ZombiCon Saturday when gunshots sent the crowds, many of them dressed as zombies and coated in fake blood, running for their lives, ABC News reported. The shooting occurred 15 minutes before the event was scheduled to end. Police are now asking anyone who attended ZombiCon to hand in pictures or cellphone video, hoping that one will have captured the shooting. So far, the gunman has eluded capture. ZombiCon is a 9-year-old annual event, which takes place in downtown Fort Myers and is described as a ""zombie-themed music and art fest."" In its inaugural year, only 500 people attended, but the event has swollen to attract the 20,000 zombie-lovers that showed up for the festivities this weekend.  The group hired Danial Costoulas' firm, Global Security Group International, in 2013 and 2014, but he pulled out of this year's event due to a ""lack of communication and disorganization"" prior to this year's ZombiCon, he told Naples Daily News. And in the wake of the shooting, Costoulas has come forward to point out that ZombiCon didn't have checkpoints, which allowed people to enter the event grounds without being inspected by security. He also said fewer personnel were monitoring the perimeter. Now, a mass shooting has claimed another life, and Taylor's high school football coach, Pete Walker, is devastated.  Expavious had in recent years lost his mother, father, grandmother, and a child at birth. A two-sport athlete who played as offensive lineman at a Miami junior college, he was interested in pursuing either forensic or mortuary science, and worked in a funeral home for job experience. ""Why would somebody do this?"" his older sister, Amanda Andrews asked. ""Everybody loved him."" In the wake of the shooting, Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson said there are currently no plans to shut down or move ZombiCon next year. "

http://www.ibtimes.com/gun-control-laws-connecticut-new-york-upheld-federal-court-policy-debate-swirls-2146782,"Two gun control laws in New York and Connecticut enacted after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School were upheld Monday by a federal appeals court. The laws ban the possession of semiautomatic assault weapons in both states, Reuters reported. A New York state provision regulating load limits, which are the number of bullets in an ammunition magazine, was struck down. In addition to semi-automatic rifles being banned, certain large-capacity magazines also are no longer legal. Both laws were created following the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, when 26 children and staff at an elementary school were shot and killed by a single gunman. The Sandy Hook shooting was responsible for increased scrutiny of the nation's gun laws and has led to high-profile politicians in the Democratic Party championing stricter legislation that would make it difficult for people to buy guns without a background check in all scenarios. Federal law currently leaves open exemptions for guns sold at gun shows and for private sales between individuals. The New York and Connecticut laws met resistance from a coalition of firearms dealers, sport-shooting enthusiasts and Second Amendment purists who argued the laws infringe on the right to bear arms. Stricter gun control laws have been championed on the 2016 presidential campaign trail by the likes of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Both have been tapping into an increased desire among progressives to address what's seen as a growing epidemic as a rising number of gun deaths make their way into national news headlines. The number of high-profile shootings has seemingly jumped, precipitating the perceived need for gun control by progressives. Most Republicans, on the other hand, suggest addressing mental health issues, as opposed to gun regulations, as the necessary approach to reducing gun violence."
http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gun-688155-mass-control.html,"Trending: Once again, more massive gun violence means more hooey from Mark Landsbaum [“Mass murders don’t happen at gun ranges,” Opinion, Oct 10]. After reading his columns over the years, it has become abundantly clear that he has no penchant for reason and sensibility, nor any affinity for the truth. Like most gun zealots, instead of even suggesting that, somehow or some way, we might find a reasonable solution that addresses the gun violence that cripples our country, he jumps right into the “president threatens to make gun ownership illegal” lie just a few short lines into the column. Are you kidding me? The president has never suggested that he would make gun ownership illegal. That type of propaganda was trumpeted so often when Obama first took office that there was an ammunition shortage as gun enthusiasts bought up all the bullets they could get their hands on. The fact is that, after every mass shooting, any discussion having to do with limiting access to guns gets muted by the gun lobby screaming that the “Left” is trying to abolish the Second Amendment. Debate can’t even begin as politicians fear what might happen should they cross the NRA. Mr. Landsbaum completely distorts the truth on the reduction of gun deaths in Australia after that country banned semiautomatic and automatic rifles and shotguns. Study after study conclude that gun violence continues to decline there, despite any report to the contrary. Ultimately, the conclusion I was drawn to is that, when everyone is armed, there will be no mass shootings. Is that where this country needs to go? A .45 on every hip in order to feel safe? Every person driving armed on the busy I-405? Every father at a Little League game packing heat? Lots of guns in every church, every school, every movie theater? Please, let’s find a better solution. Steve Copley Foothill Ranch • • • Mark Landsbaum took on gun-control advocates in his Captain Obvious column entitled “Mass murders don’t happen at gun ranges” [Opinion, Oct. 10]. No, not mass murders – just the occasional suicide, murder or double murder, as happened to “American Sniper” Chris Kyle. He compares the relative safety of a building full of armed and well-trained gun owners with the danger of schools and other “gun-free zones” being full of “clay pigeons” – a charming depiction of the victims. He falls back on carefully selected and often-used statistics to “prove” that the fewer guns in a given locale, the more likely that people will die. I call this the “O.K. Corral” theory of anti-gun-control: If a room full of potential victims are all armed, then the shootout can commence, and the good guys will win. Anyone who objects to this theory is considered anti-gun, and pro-confiscation. As long as he and others who are opposed to any regulation of arms other than “any gun, for any person, at any time” continue to bang the paranoia drum, nothing will change, no movement will be made, and more people will die at the hands of an individual who had ready access to an arsenal. And anyone who decries these crimes will be accused of seizing upon the occasion for political purposes. Good thing the gun lobby and Landsbaum are above that, isn’t it? Elise Power Garden Grove • • • Mark Landsbaum’s explanation of mass shootings and gun violence in general is so painfully simple in concept, I don’t understand why those in favor of more gun control can’t see this idea as a significant contribution to reducing gun violence. It sounds quite radical on the surface but, considering human nature, I believe it would work. Most mass shooters are cowards and don’t want to be a victim of their own crime. If they thought anyone around them could be armed, I’m sure there would be a greater sense of reluctance to carry out the crime. In the event his/her decision was to shoot, armed citizens in the vicinity would have a greater chance of limiting the rampage or at least protecting themselves. Gun-free zones are also an idiotic idea that protects no one. All one has to do is read case histories of mass shootings, and the answer will be self-evident. President Obama blames the ready availability of guns in our society for gun violence in America. I can only point out that, in past decades, before gun control, guns were much easier to obtain and a greater number of households owned them. Mass shootings then were almost nonexistent. Logic would conclude that another cause may be to blame. Most agree that many mass shooters and those involved in gun violence are mentally disturbed. This is really the root of the problem. The fact is, as a percentage of the population, we have many more mentally ill people in our society than in past decades. The challenge is not only how do we treat it, but what is causing it. Bob Miller Anaheim • • • Excellent column by Mark Landsbaum, pointing out why gun control is such a hot-button issue in our society. People who try to control every aspect of our freedom and lives through laws have an absurd perspective about what laws can do. There are so many issues that are at the heart of these shooting tragedies that have nothing to do with gun control. These include serious failures by our states and country in addressing rampant mental illness, endless poverty for large segments of our population and outright criminal behavior by huge numbers of gangs. Those who exploit these tragedies for “gun control” are political opportunists who ignore the many more complex and significant societal issues that drive these tragedies. Larry Hamlin Dana Point • • • If Democrats were truly honest about trusting the government to protect them, why don’t they post signs in front of their houses, announcing that it is a gun-free zone? Gun-free zones are free killing zones for crazies, and no laws will prevent this. George Eazell Placentia Get the latest news delivered daily!

According to authorities, Stewart was arrested about 11:50 a.m. and interviewed by investigators. Jail records show a booking time of about 4:03 p.m. Police said he ""admitted to writing the post and having thoughts of carrying out the threat, but had no specific target in mind.""

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/10/federal_court_upholds_assault-.html,"Fast and Furious Trial A federal court has upheld laws in New York and Connecticut banning semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines. (Matt York, Associated Press) A federal appeals court ruled Monday that laws in New York and Connecticut banning semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines are constitutional, reports say. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York did strike down a provision in New York barring gun owners from loading more than seven bullets in a clip and a Connecticut prohibition on the non-semiautomatic Remington 7615, Reuters reports. According to the New York Times, the court ruled the laws did not violate the Second Amendment, adding that states had ""substantial evidence"" to pass the laws in order to control crime. Both states passed the laws after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Mass., in which 26 people were killed, including 20 children. The gunman was armed with 10 30-round magazines for a semiautomatic Bushmaster .223 caliber model XM15 rifle and bullets for two handguns and a shotgun. He fired 154 rounds in less than five minutes. ""When used, these weapons tend to result in more numerous wounds, more serious wounds, and more victims. These weapons are disproportionately used in crime, and particularly in criminal mass shootings,"" the ruling written by Circuit Judge Jose A. Cabranes reads, according to the Associated Press. ""They are also disproportionately used to kill law enforcement officers."" The state's laws had been challenged by a coalition which included firearms dealers, sports shooters and gun owners, according to Reuters. They argued mass shootings are rare events and that the state laws would have a ""minimal impact"" on reducing crime. ""That may be so,"" Cabranes said, according to the Times, but added ""gun-control legislation need not strike at all evils at the same time to be constitutional."" Tom King, the president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, a plaintiff, tells the Times that the ruling will be appealed. ""As we've stated right from the beginning, this was going to be a Supreme Court case, and that's where we're headed,"" King said. Timothy Lytton, who teaches at Georgia State University College of Law and authored ""Suing the Gun Industry,"" tells Reuters it's doubtful the law will have an effect on federal or state legislators in regard to gun control. ""Court opinions like this are not likely to move legislatures,"" Lytton said. ""The federal government has been at a stalemate over gun control legislation for well over a decade. If Sandy Hook could not move Congress to action, nothing is likely to."" Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Assistant City Attorney Paula Jones, sitting as a special judge in District Court, ordered Anthony Paul Stewart, 20, to be held without bail at the Pulaski County jail. Relatives of Stewart said at Tuesday's court hearing that he is mentally ill and needs treatment, but they were unsure how to provide that. ""I feel like I've tried every avenue,"" said Nancy Stewart, his grandmother. According to a police affidavit, Anthony Stewart wrote Sunday on the social networking site Meet Me: ""Before I die I wanna do a mass shooting. Break the record."" Investigators, using information released by the website, found and arrested Stewart at his grandmother's home at 4524 Frank St. shortly before noon Monday. Police spokesman Sgt. Brian Dedrick said in a news release that Stewart ""admitted to writing the post and having thoughts of carrying out the threat, but had no specific target in mind."" Police detective Michael Gibbons, speaking in court Tuesday, said Stewart is an unemployed retail and construction worker who didn't finish high school and is ""homeless, for the most part."" Gibbons said Stewart is estranged from most of his family, but his grandmother allows him to sleep on her porch at night. She won't let him inside while she's asleep because she's concerned about safety, according to Gibbons. Stewart, after being arrested, told police he has suicidal and homicidal thoughts, Gibbons said. The affidavit states it isn't the first threat police have looked into involving Stewart. In December 2009, when Stewart was a teenager, he was suspected of posting online about killing teachers, according to the affidavit. A police report was filed, but further details weren't available Tuesday. Court records show Stewart has no adult criminal record.

October 21, 2015 The University of Mississippi's Associated Student Body has passed a resolution to take down the state flag, which bears the Confederate battle emblem, from university grounds. The resolution states that the flag divides the campus, undermines the school's efforts to promote diversity, and violates the university's creed, which calls for respect for the dignity of each person. “It’s just overwhelming to know that the voices of students that are affected by this image, that feel excluded by this image, that are hurt by the symbol, that their voices were heard,"" the resolution’s sponsor, student Allen Coon, told The Jackson Clarion-Ledger. ""It means that we truly are taking steps toward progress, that we care about change, that we care about students and that we respect difference.” The measure was passed on a 33 to 15 vote, with one abstaining voter. Following the June 17 mass shooting at a landmark black church in Charleston, S.C., by Dylann Roof, Confederate symbols have come under increased public scrutiny. The 21-year-old shooter confessed that he was attempting to start a race war and photos quickly emerged of him displaying a variety of flags associated with white supremacy, including the Confederate battle flag. A nationwide movement erupted to rid public places of the flag. Earlier this week, commissioners in Greene County, Tennessee, resoundingly voted down one commissioner’s proposal to fly the Confederate battle flag above the courthouse as a sign of the region’s “heritage and loyalties.” The Christian Science Monitor reported 20 commissioners voted “no,” leaving local sheriff’s deputy James ""Buddy"" Randolph, who wrote the proposal, the only commissioner in favor. On Monday, the Florida Senate removed the Confederate battle flag from the chamber's official seal. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that Mississippi, a complex and frequently misunderstood Southern state, is also experiencing a shift in thinking on the flag and its modern legacy. Many top state officials seeking reelection are largely steering clear of the topic, with incumbent Gov. Phil Bryant saying the question should go to a referendum. But by state law, that couldn’t occur until 2018. Legally, the legislature could furl the flag as soon as it meets early next year. Mississippians more broadly are reconsidering a long-held belief that the flag represents a rich history, not bigotry. Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn said recently that “the flag has become a point of offense” for many people. On Friday, Ole Miss students held a rally to support removing the flag, carrying signs that read ""This is our University too,"" ""#whataboutus?,"" ""I am more than a flag,"" and ""Straight Outta Patience, "" according to the Ole Miss student newspaper. A group of pro-Confederate battle flag supporters from the Ku Klux Klan also attended the rally. The issue now goes to the university senior officials to decide whether or not to implement the Associated Student Body’s decision. If the university leadership agrees with the student body, Ole Miss will be the fourth Mississippi college to remove the flag from campus, alongside Jackson State University, Mississippi Valley State University, and Alcorn State University.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

Can we as a culture value the powerful opportunity to explore the inevitable complexity of one's mind and emotions in a safe relationship -- especially with an appropriately trained therapist? Can we appreciate that what we call mental illness does not only afflict a handful of people in distinct and obvious ways, but all of us at various points in our lives due to a variety of circumstances? And can we effectively convince insurance companies to cover such treatments as they would any other service that has been proven to lead to optimal health? We can't identify who is going to be the next shooter with tests and diagnosis. But we can adjust our thinking regarding optimal mental and physical health and, rather than continuing to stigmatize those individuals engaged in long term talk therapy, accept the fact that it provides great benefits for all of us. Here is a piece I wrote for HuffPost on the subject shortly after the Sandy Hook shootings of 2012. I am posting the link so that you can read it exactly as it was, since little to nothing has changed. Let's please make an adjustment in our thinking and where we put our money before this happens again.

http://feeds.ew.com/~r/entertainmentweekly/latest-blog-news/~3/4cITO94T4kI/ed-sheeran-pharrell-john-legend-concert-progress-race-america,"Get ready for a true all-star, collaborative concert this fall. A+E Networks and iHeartMedia are putting on Shining a Light: A Concert for Progress on Race in America in Los Angeles. The title and the lineup are works in progress, but confirmed names include: a mid-hiatus Dr. Ed Sheeran, Pharrell, John Legend, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Jamie Foxx, Zac Brown Band, Eric Church, Miguel, Pink, Sia, Rhiannon Giddens, Tori Kelly, and Jill Scott. And there are more names on the horizon in the gig that promises “a once-in-a-lifetime series of duets.” The concert is the first program in A+E’s campaign concerning race issues in the country. The concerted effort was inspired by members of the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, S.C. recovering from June’s mass shooting that saw nine people killed. After the concert, a new one-hour special Shining a Light: Conversations on Race in America will air that sees artists go into communities that have seen violence, such as Charleston, Baltimore, Chicago, and Ferguson, Mo., and lead discussions with different members of society. “The current racial situation in America is at a critical point,” said executive producer Ken Ehrlich in a statement. “Today’s musical artists, much like those of the civil rights movement’s history, have strong feelings about what’s going on today, and we’re hopeful that Shining a Light does, in fact, give a voice to their concerns, their hopes, and their thinking about solutions to the alarming events that we see around us every day.” WANT MORE EW? Subscribe now to keep up with the latest in movies, television and music. The concert, which will help raise money for the Fund for Progress on Race in America powered by United Way Worldwide, will happen Nov. 18 in L.A.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2517098/james-holmes-colorado-movie-theater-shooter-beaten-up-in-prison-by-a-fellow-inmate/,"James Holmes, the Colorado movie shooter who killed 12 people at the Century movie theater in Aurora in 2012, has been beaten up by a fellow inmate at Colorado's State Penitentiary, the state's maximum-security prison, according to Reuters. The incident took place on October 8 when Holmes was being moved by a correctional officer through the facility. Mark C. Daniels, who is also referred as ""Slim"" within the penitentiary, charged at Holmes and ""took a few swings"" at him, according to Adrienne Jacobson, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When the correctional officer tried to break up the fight, Daniels, 27, charged at the officer, too; however, nobody was seriously injured in the attack.  Jacobson, speaking to the Associated Press about the incident, was keen to avoid getting into the details. However, she did confirm that the fight took place when both offenders were being moved from their cells.  Though the authorities were not keen on divulging the details of the incident, Daniels allegedly wrote a letter to The Denver Post after his brawl with James Holmes, describing the reasons that led to the attack. Colorado Department of Corrections has not yet confirmed the authenticity of the letter, though it is believed the initials on the letter correspond to that of Daniels. Holmes was moved to the Colorado State Penitentiary as recently as September and as a result has not had the time to interact with other prisoners, prison authorities said. Daniels, who has used many aliases in the past including a female pseudonym, Katrina Martinez, is serving time for numerous convictions for menacing, auto theft, assault and smuggling contraband into prison. He was also charged with first degree assault on a guard in 2006. Holmes was sentenced to more than 3,200 years in prison on 24 counts of murder and 140 counts of attempted murder, after he opened fire at people attending a midnight screening of the Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises. on July 20, 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. A day later, police found his apartment booby-trapped with explosives, which were defused by a bomb squad. James had pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges against him, citing insanity in his defense. Though the jury had failed to reach an unanimous decision about his execution, he was sentenced to prison for the rest of his life without a chance of parole.   It is still not clear if James Holmes will be relocated to another prison as the result of the assault, but it remains a possibility. [Photo by RJ Sangosti-Pool/Getty Images]"

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/120113123/0/phoenix/opinions~My-Turn-ways-to-fix-the-gun-problem/,"How do we balance the Second Amendment and gun control? Should we ban guns in more places? Since 1950, every public mass shooting in the United States (with the exception of two) has occurred in a place where civilians are banned from carrying firearms. President Obama touted the Australia model, which involved confiscating guns through a buyback. The population in Australia is approximately 25 million, compared to 330 million in the United States. Somewhere between 650,000 and 1 million guns were confiscated in Australia, but there are still about 4 million remaining. The vast majority of gun owners in the U.S. are law-abiding citizens who are well trained in the use of firearms, or in some cases, just collectors of older weapons. They are not the problem. Since these people actually obey the law, if they were forced to turn them in, they would probably do so. That does not take into account the criminals and mentally deranged individuals who would never turn them in, and the ones most likely to use them against others. Neither side will win this argument, and probably neither would like my solutions below. That is good, because it means they are realistic. While the problem and argument will never be solved, these solutions will go a long way toward reducing the number of deaths caused by criminals and deranged individuals. Issue gun-owner licenses Rather than doing background checks at the time of a purchase, it would make more sense to issue a gun-owner license, much like a driver's license. To get such a license, a person would need to be 18 years of age and take a gun safety and responsibility course, which would include the appropriate handling and storing of weapons. Anyone already owning a gun would be required to take such a class or provide documentation showing he had already taken such a class. Like automobiles, there can be different levels of licensing based upon the type of gun, with each level requiring more scrutiny. If a license is denied without due cause, the applicant will have standing to sue the state (or federal government, depending on who will be issuing the license), and can receive an award of attorney fees if it is ruled that denial of the license was unwarranted. Sell only to those with licenses The right to bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment. The right to sell arms is not. If someone wants to sell a gun he no longer wants, he may only sell that gun to a licensed individual. If someone sells a gun to an unlicensed individual, he will be subject to prosecution for doing so. Furthermore, if the individual he sold the gun to uses that gun in a criminal manner, the seller could be held as an accomplice, both criminally and civilly, to that crime. Just as when one sells a car, the sale must be reported. Failure to report the sale within a reasonable time will also make the seller liable as an accomplice if the gun is used in a crime. Hold loaners accountable for crime If a licensed individual loans a gun to any individual, licensed or not, and the borrower uses that gun in a criminal manner, the loaner will be held as an accomplice, both criminally and civilly, to that crime. Punish improper storage If a licensed individual is negligent in the secure storage of weapons owned by him, and through that negligence allows those weapons to be taken by someone who uses them in criminal activity, the owner can be civilly liable to anyone harmed by the use of those weapons. Furthermore, if a licensed individual discovers that one or more of his guns was stolen, the licensed owner must report that theft within 48 hours of discovery of the theft. Failure to do so will make the owner liable as an accomplice and civilly liable to anyone harmed by the use of those weapons. If the theft is not reported within seven days, the owner can also be held criminally liable as an accomplice. Revoke licenses for improper use The license will expire in four years and can be renewed. If the license expires, or if it is not renewed for cause, any guns in the individual's possession must immediately be sold, rendered inoperable or turned in. Any infraction or improper use of any weapon by the licensee will result in immediate termination of the license. Break the rules? Go to jail Any unlicensed individual found to be in possession of a gun shall be liable for that violation and automatically required to serve a minimum of 90 days in jail and pay a $10,000 fine for a first offense. Subsequent offenses shall increase the penalty. Require mental-illness reporting Medical professionals and family members who are aware of any mental illness or instability must report to law enforcement regarding that mental illness or instability if there is a reasonable belief that an individual is a danger to himself or others. Such a report could be the basis for denying an application or for revoking a license of a licensee. Host a voluntary gun buyback When all of this has been completed and licenses issued, the government can sponsor a voluntary buyback program directed more to the areas where the most crime occurs. If the guns do not have serial numbers on them, they can be destroyed. If they do have serial numbers on them, they can be resold to people holding a valid license to keep the cost to the taxpayers at a minimum. Any that are not sold within six months will be destroyed. Keep license data confidential The data, names and locations of licensed individuals shall not be divulged by the licensee agency to any other government branch, bureau, agency or individual without first obtaining a court order, which can be granted only with reasonable cause. This is not a perfect solution, nor will it make an immediate change regarding those criminal individuals who already have weapons. However, it is a good first step.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/25/good_guys_with_guns_128546.html,"He said he’d been waiting to kill people for a long time,” 18-year-old Anastasia Boylan told “Good Morning America” from her hospital bed. Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, murdered 10 people and wounded Ms. Boylan and six others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., Oct. 1. Harper-Mercer asked his victims to identify their religion, she said. Those who said they were Christians he shot in the head. All but two mass shootings since 1950 have taken place where ordinary citizens are forbidden to carry guns or are unlikely to have them, according to John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center. In its survey of mass shootings between 1982 and 2013, Mother Jones magazine found whites and blacks were mass shooters in about the same proportion as their numbers in the general population, though media often portray mass shooters as almost exclusively white males. Harper-Mercer’s father is white, his mother is black. The Los Angeles Times said he had “white supremacy leanings.” In the wake of the shooting, President Barack Obama called for “common sense gun control,” citing as examples countries which essentially forbid private ownership of firearms. But no gun control measure he’s proposed would have stopped Harper-Mercer. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh found zero correlation between gun laws and homicides. A 2004 evaluation of existing research by the National Academy of Sciences failed to identify any gun control measure that had reduced violent crime. The NAS attributed this to a lack of data. As gun ownership in the United States has risen, violent crime rates have fallen. Violent crime is rampant in cities with strict gun control laws. There is very little in Vermont, which has virtually no gun regulations. Writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy in 2007, criminologists Don Kates and Gary Mauser found that in both Britain and the United States, violent crime rates are lowest where legal gun ownership is highest. Norway, Finland, Germany, France and Denmark have high rates of gun ownership, but low murder rates, Messrs. Kates and Mauser found. The murder rate in Luxembourg, where ownership of handguns is banned, is nine times greater than in Germany. There were 14,249 murders in the United States last year, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report. That’s a rate of 5.2 per 100,000 people, tops among the advanced nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Ten cities, all with strict gun control laws, had 2,398 murders, a murder rate of 9.53. The murder rate in the rest of the United States was 2.71. Mass killers may be insane, but they’re not stupid. They choose for their murder sprees places where they know they are unlikely to be interrupted by a law-abiding citizen with a gun. “The suspect in the Charleston, S.C., shootings in June originally aimed to attack the College of Charleston,” Mr. Lott noted. “He chose a church instead because the college had armed guards.” In his 141-page “manifesto,” Elliot Rodger, 22 -- who murdered six and wounded 14 near the University of California-Santa Barbara last year -- said he ruled out various targets where there might be armed security. Some of the students who survived the Umpqua massacre want to get guns to protect themselves. In a Rasmussen poll in June, 68 percent of Americans said they prefer to live in a neighborhood where they and their neighbors are allowed to own guns. In a Gallup poll last November, 63 percent of respondents said they think having guns in their homes makes them safer. Every mass shooting has ended when the killer was shot by a good guy with a gun, or committed suicide when good guys with guns arrived. These are usually police officers, but, as Mr. Lott has reported, “Case after case occurs where concealed handgun permit holders stop what would have been mass shootings.” Jack Kelly is a columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio."
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/9K4TwBC6UY8/the-dog-whistle-politics-of-gun-control.html,"SEARCH Whenever the media talks about ‘gun control,’ it sends gun hoarders into a frenzy. It’s time to use a different phrase. Olivia Pope and Associates (OPA), the smartest, bravest, best-dressed crisis communications company in the nation’s capital, recently took on the sensitive topic of dog-whistle politics. Dog-whistle politics refers to inflammatory language so coded that when the media repeats it, the insult or the perceived threat cannot be heard by the general public. Hence the term dog-whistle. While OPA is a fictitious company in ABC’s hit television show, Scandal, the concept of dog-whistle politics is real. Spoiler alert. In this episode when Olivia, (or Liv as her friends call her), finds herself in a salacious, high-profile sex scandal of her own, she clams up. A journalist reporting on Liv’s silence describes her as usually “so well spoken.” Sounds like a compliment, right? Not really. As one of Liv’s gladiators explains, that is a dog-whistle to professional women of color who hear it as “well-spoken … for a black woman.” Does the media blow dog-whistles intentionally? I hope not. Yet, it often uses polarizing language unaware of the impact it has on those who hear or read it differently than the general public. The phrase “gun control” is a dog-whistle. For the general public who repeat it because they hear it in the media, it is just a catch-phrase meant to encompass laws and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children, the criminally insane, convicted domestic abusers, and felons. For the paranoid Nancy Lanzas of America, it triggers an irrational fear of government control. When they hear that whistle blown, they arm up for imaginary Armageddons. Gavin de Becker, a world-renowned security expert, ripped that dog-whistle right out of my mouth 15 years ago when he heard me blow it on-air while promoting the Million Mom March. Apparently a focus group conducted long ago shed light on how this seemingly innocent phrase impacts a particularly fragile segment of our society—gun hoarders. Many in the media have been warned about this. For years. Yet, they continue to use it. Why? I am reluctant to criticize the media because most of my professional career, my job has been to promote it and the journalists who work in it. I protect them too. In real life-and-death situations. (And not the “my wife will kill me if she finds out” kind). Real ones. When Iraqi soldiers kidnapped Bob Simon and his CBS News crew during Desert Storm, I was their spokeswoman during those 40 harrowing days, publicly urging the State Department to use its diplomatic ties to find them. And, they did. So, I respect journalists, many of whom face dangerous situations everyday. However, covering the Chamber of Commerce should not be one of them, as it was for two of the profession’s brightest and up-and-coming last August in Roanoke, Virginia. Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Shot dead on live TV. That should be enough of a wake-up call to the profession that it inadvertently contributes to the problem. While the dog-whistle of “gun control” makes for lively talk radio over at the EIB network, it is also deadly for America’s children who get caught in the crosshairs of congressional inaction. The death of Aavielle Nevaeh Wakefield—the cherubic, 5-month-old Cleveland baby shot the same day as Oregon’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College—had grown men weeping on live TV. Cleveland’s police chief cried. The Daily Beast’s Michael Daly cried. I cried too. At so many deaths and at the news tickers that crawled across America’s TVs with “cries for gun control.” Media, wake up. Those dog-whistle words prompt speed-dialers to call their lawmakers from their basements where they are holed up with their fears, fueled by gun lobby propaganda that “Obama is coming for” their guns. While the politics of guns in America is complicated, the wording for the solutions is not. Academics and seasoned public health advocates replaced “gun control” long ago with “gun violence prevention,” using “GVP” for short-hand. Confused news writers should just follow their lead. Clearly, the media understands the need for nifty acronyms when it comes to their brands. If not, on-air anchors like Brian Williams would be tripping over their tongues identifying themselves as the Microsoft National Broadcasting Company (MSNBC). Can GVP and America’s ingrained attitudes surrounding gun ownership be discussed intelligently without blowing the dog-whistle? You bet, as demonstrated recently on the ABC comedy, Black-ish. Spoiler alert. The episode opens with an HMS (helicopter mom on steroids) dropping off her son for a sleepover at the fictitious home of Dre and Bow. The HMS is anxious about her son’s safety because, she explains, “in-vitro was not cheap!” She then rattles off a list of her concerns. Will her baby (now a teenager) be exposed to such hazards as peanuts? Gluten? Black mold? That HBO show, Girls? When she brings up guns in the home, that sets up rest of the show to discuss gun safety, an important part of GVP. If only the brilliant Black-ish writers would take a stab at the AP Stylebook—the journalistic bible that strives to bring consistent accuracy to news media writing. There must be a way to make GVP an acronym as common as, let’s say, AP? The GVP movement has never been stronger, encompassing many organizations from the PTA to the URJ. It is time for the media to put down the dog-whistle and embrace the serious, thoughtful, sometimes painful discussions now taking place among public health advocates across America about the best ways to reduce death and injury by guns. Nothing being proposed conflicts with the Second Amendment. Until that happens, journalists should plan on reporting the inevitable stories about baby shootings and toddlers who shoot other toddlers. Yes, that actually happens in America while Congress takes no action. And that is the real scandal in the nation’s capital."

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/26/fiorina_needs_another_good_debate_128535.html,"The Republican primary debates have served as fuel for Carly Fiorina’s long-shot presidential bid. The businesswoman’s standout performances in Cleveland and Simi Valley, Calif., have helped transform her from an underdog into a viable contender. Her poll numbers rose significantly in the immediate aftermath of both debates, and sizable cash donations followed. But as she heads to Round 3 in Boulder, Colo., this week, there is perhaps more pressure on her than ever before. A handful of recent national polls show Fiorina’s post-debate bump has faded, while candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson have maintained, and in some cases, increased, their leads. What’s more, another competitor, Marco Rubio, continues to rise. The next debate offers the former Hewlett-Package CEO a chance to regain her stride. But her greater challenge is to better capitalize on that performance and prove her campaign is more than a series of bright but ephemeral moments on the grand stage. The Fiorina campaign argues that the candidate’s upward trajectory from her start is more significant than the short-term ups and downs that have followed. And, as most campaigns believe, hers stresses that activity and standing in the early voting states matter more than national grades. According to the RealClearPolitics polling averages, Fiorina places in the top five contenders in Iowa (where she is tied with Jeb Bush), New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida. She has been actively focused on those early states, and her stump schedule is demanding enough to wear out the fittest of contenders. Fiorina has done 72 events in Iowa alone this cycle, according to the Des Moines Register’s candidate tracker. Only Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, who are essentially camped out in the state but still lagging in the polls, have done more. On Friday, Fiorina made several stops in South Carolina, where she currently ranks third in the RCP average. Last week, she also campaigned in the Sunshine State. “You know in your heart of hearts that you cannot wait to see me debate Hillary Clinton,” she told a group there, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Indeed, Fiorina has positioned herself as the person in the GOP race best positioned and most unafraid to take on Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. But she has several other rivals to overcome first. And as the race wears on, Fiorina’s path has become murky. On the one hand, she is technically a political outsider in an environment that favors such candidates. But her credentials in that regard aren’t quite pure. Unlike Trump and Carson, Fiorina has run for public office before — a U.S. Senate race in California in 2010, when she lost by a wide margin in a favorable year for Republicans. And her pedigree, resume, and beliefs are more aligned with the so-called establishment part of the party. In many ways, this crossover is what makes her so appealing. She’s not a politician, and often laments the failings of the political class, but she is also acceptable to the party faithful, or those who may also be inclined to back someone such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio, notes Nate Cohn of the New York Times’ “Upshot.” But that dynamic also puts her in a tough spot. On the outsider side, Trump and Carson have big leads. And on the establishment-aligned side, Rubio, who has the political experience, is ascending, especially as Bush’s numbers fall. “It’s not clear there is room for a new comer like Fiorina in the ranks of Bush and Rubio, if that’s her ultimate aim,” says Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “She is quite capable of delivering a consistent, high-level performance that might inch her forward, but without the experience, it’s hard to see her lasting in the long run.” Also working against her is the way in which Trump and Carson are able to garner media attention. Even though Fiorina was considered the winner of the last debate, Trump managed to stay in the spotlight and remain relevant, even if it was by making outlandish or incendiary comments that earned him attention, like the fight he picked with Jeb Bush over his brother’s 9/11 legacy. Carson also managed to suck up the oxygen for a while with controversial remarks about Muslims and his response to the mass shooting in Oregon. (A Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers -- the second survey last week to show the retired neurosurgeon significantly leading Trump in the Hawkeye State -- found most respondents unfazed by, or even in agreement with, Carson’s remarks.) “There’s no question Fiorina needs to take better advantage of her outstanding debate performances and her outstanding interview skills,” says Cheri Jacobus, a GOP strategist. Fiorina earned plenty of media attention after the Simi Valley debate, but it was centered on a controversy that ultimately had a negative impact. Her business record at HP has come under higher scrutiny since then, namely the 30,000 jobs lost during a merger she orchestrated and her subsequent ouster, which included a handsome severance package. The attention also focused on the Planned Parenthood videos Fiorina referenced during her most emotional moment in the debate, a description that turned out to be inaccurate. Apparently to counter this, a campaign event in the days after the debate included a trip to a pregnancy center to watch a sonogram being performed. While the controversy surrounding Fiorina and the Planned Parenthood videos isn’t likely to turn off GOP voters, the scrutiny surrounding her business record has the potential to, especially as other rivals, Trump in particular, pile on. “She had two weeks of tough coverage basically saying she wasn't competent at the thing that's her number one credential,” notes Lynn Vavreck, a political science professor at UCLA whose book on the 2012 election, “The Gamble,” details the impact of media coverage on campaigns. “She’s got this moment where she is glowing [after the debate] and she needed to be able to seize on that, use the moment to trot out the campaign plan and strategy, what her message is, and how you differentiate from the others,” Vavreck says. “It’s a huge missed opportunity. … She needs to create something.” Fiorina had a remarkable fundraising quarter, bringing in $7 million — $1 million more than Rubio and a substantial increased from the $1.7 million she raised in the previous period. She had $5.5 million in cash on hand as of Sept. 30. Her campaign runs a very lean operation with few paid staffers. Spokeswoman Anna Epstein would not comment about whether the campaign planned to add more staff, but said the campaign does not have plans to run ads on the air anytime soon. “Carly has spent the last month talking with voters, especially in NH, IA, and SC. We are very pleased with where the campaign is and we look forward to the opportunity for Carly to introduce herself to even more voters at next week's debate,” Epstein said in an email. A super PAC, Carly for America, is focused specifically on the ground operation in the early states, which has tested the limits of coordination between the PAC and the campaign. (Carly for America isn’t planning on airing ads either.) Craig Robinson, an Iowa Republican strategist, says that Fiorina has been generating large crowds during her recent events in the state and that people are interested in her candidacy, but that her downward poll numbers show she hasn’t yet turned good debate performances into substantial ground efforts. “She raised good money with all that attention, which is important, but ultimately attention and money have to turn into actual votes,” Robinson said. “I think not having a robust campaign operation in Iowa and instead relying on her super PAC to do that work may have hurt her.” Wednesday’s debate, hosted by CNBC, will focus on the economy, which could give Fiorina a chance to tout her business credentials, but could also again raise the specter of her mixed record. “She needs to be focused, credible, and articulate and clear on her positions,” says Jacobus. “And I think she should ignore Trump.” Indeed, Trump’s controversial comments about her “face” gave Fiorina an opportunity at the last debate to take him on directly. This time, however, some strategists say, she needs to focus on herself. “She has all the right tools, she has worked very hard, clearly, to learn and to sharpen her skills, and she has got the knowledge base and the right instincts,” says Penny Young Nance, the president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. “I expect she will shine and get another bump,” Nance says. “The question is whether or not those bumps at some point will catch fire.” Caitlin Huey-Burns is a national political reporter for RealClearPolitics.

We can't afford to come up short, and there's still a long way to go by November 5. ipopba/iStock  After each highly publicized mass shooting, there’s a political debate about how to make them stop, with researchers and politicians alike firing up about assault-rifle bans, background checks, and other possible solutions. But Brad Bushman, a psychology and communications professor at Ohio State University, takes a broader view. Bushman researches the psychological mechanisms behind gun violence: Does having a weapon around make us more aggressive? How about watching video games? How do we respond biologically to seeing a gun? In a recent episode of the Inquiring Minds podcast, host Indre Viskontas spoke to Bushman about what he and others in the field have found.  Over the years, Bushman explains, dozens of studies have confirmed what researchers dub the “weapons effect”: People act more aggressively in the presence of a weapon, especially when something angers them. One study by researchers at Harvard found that drivers with guns in the car were more likely to engage in road rage, closely tailing other drivers and making obscene gestures—even when researchers controlled for things like gender, age, urbanization, and more. Similar studies in labs have found that the presence of a gun causes participants enraged by another person to choose to make that person physically uncomfortable for longer periods of time, from delivering more electric shocks to forcing them to hear louder noises or keep their arms plunged in ice water for longer. In a review of 50 such studies, including more than 5,000 participants, Bushman found not only that the weight of the evidence support the weapons effect, but that the effect was also seen, though not to the same degree, with those who hadn’t been angered. Some studies hint at the biological mechanisms at play, finding, for example, that our brains recognize guns just as quickly as other threats that we’ve evolved to quickly spot, like snakes and spiders. (It’s worth noting that this effect isn’t unique to guns: Syringes have been found to have a similar effect.) A 2006 study went a step further, connecting biological changes with aggression. Here’s how it went: Researchers took saliva samples of 30 male college students in order to test their levels of testosterone, a hormone typically associated with aggression. Then, the students were told to hang out in a room by themselves—inside of which was a TV, a couch, and either a pellet gun or a kids toy—and write down instructions on how either the gun or the toy worked. After 15 minutes, the students gave another saliva sample, and then they were told to add some hot sauce to a cup of water that they were led to believe another participant would have to drink. The results: Those participants in the rooms with pellet guns had higher increases in testosterone, and the more the testosterone levels increased, the more hot sauce they added to the water. Of course, these studies often run into the same problem: No matter how spicy the hot sauce or cold the ice water, forcing people to endure physical discomfort in a lab isn’t the same as shooting people. Bushman acknowledges this, explaining that researchers can’t, for example, expose participants to a gun and then send them out into the real world with a weapon to see what happens. Still, he says, the overwhelming evidence that exposure to weapons causes physical aggression is worrisome, particularly when you consider that about a third of American homes have guns. “I think this has important implications,” says Bushman. “They should put those guns in opaque containers or lock them up, separate from the ammunition. Some people display the guns in glass cabinets; that’s a really bad idea because research shows just the mere presence of guns can increase aggression.” If seeing guns makes people more aggressive, it follows that violent media would do the same. This has been a controversial question for years, in part because so many people play violent video games and aren’t violent. A number of studies in leading medical journals, from The Lancet to Pediatrics, have found a link between exposure to violent media and physical aggression, a lack of empathy, and asocial behavior. And several medical organizations—including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychiatric Association—consider violent media exposure to be a risk factor for actual violence. None of this, of course, proves causation—and Bushman admits, “It’s not possible to know whether playing a violent video game causes violent criminal behavior such as a school shooting.” But when it comes to video games, having weapons in the house, and general exposure to guns, Bushman takes a cautious tone. He quoted Leonard Berkowitz, the psychologist who conducted the first study on the weapons effect, back in the 1960s: “The finger pulls the trigger, but the trigger may also be pulling the finger.” Inquiring Minds is a podcast hosted by neuroscientist and musician Indre Viskontas and Kishore Hari, the director of the Bay Area Science Festival.

Every Monday On Monday, University of Mississippi police took down the state flag, which depicts the Confederate battle emblem. Loading... October 26, 2015 The University of Mississippi’s decision to remove the state flag – which depicts the Confederate battle emblem – from its campus in Oxford has once more put a spotlight on the nationwide debate over how the Confederacy should be portrayed in US history. Broadly, the move at Ole Miss speaks to Americans’ “rapidly evolving moral and intellectual views of the South's complicated past,” as the Monitor reported in June. Yet it’s actually been for the past decade or so that attitudes at the state’s flagship university have been shifting. That this institution in particular – one with deep ties to the region’s Confederate roots – has now taken down the state flag suggests that the action could resonate through Mississippi as it continues to assess its past. “We threw a big rock into a lake, and now we get to see the ripples,” says Professor John Bruce, chair of the university’s political science department. “And how the ripples behave depends on what else is happening in the water.” University police took down the flag Monday following the adoption of a student-led resolution to pull the banner from campus. The student senate voted last Tuesday to remove the flag, and the faculty senate and other campus organizations followed with similar recommendations. “The University of Mississippi community came to the realization years ago that the Confederate battle flag did not represent many of our core values, such as civility and respect for others,” said Morris Stocks, the school’s interim chancellor, in a statement. “Since that time, we have become a stronger and better university. We join other leaders in our state who are calling for a change in the state flag.” Debate over Confederate symbols rekindled across the nation – but particularly in the South – in the wake of the mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., in June. The gunman was a white supremacist who had displayed Confederate flags in photos. The discourse has continued, with one side insisting the Confederacy and its symbols are a vital part of the country’s history and the other decrying them as relics of a racist past. At Ole Miss, Professor Bruce says, it’s a conversation that has been going on for decades. “You can’t walk across this campus without coming across symbols of the past,” he says, noting the campus has a statue of a Confederate soldier, a Confederate cemetery, and buildings named after politicians who supported segregation – in addition to being the venue of deadly riots in 1962, after James Meredith became the first black student to be enrolled in the university. “Race is woven through the fabric of this place, for better or for worse,” he adds. “We are going to talk about race.” As attitudes have begun to shift at the school in recent years, Bruce says, the response statewide has been, for the most part, positive. In 1998, the university effectively prevented the Confederate battle flag from being waved at games by banning pointed objects of any kind in the school’s stadium and limiting the size of banners and signs. As former Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat told AL.com in 2013: “Over time, people began to see that the benefit of not having that flag tied to our university, or vice versa, was far more valuable than the enjoyment that anybody received from waving that flag.” Today, the university’s sports teams are still called the Rebels, although the school in 2010 replaced the Colonel Reb mascot with a black bear. Also, there was an online petition that called to keep the state flag raised on campus. ""In order to live in a free society, the possibility to be offended will occasionally occur,"" the petition read. ""Removing symbols, flags, and monuments will do nothing to change the way people feel in their hearts."" Still, the resolution to remove the flag won by a landslide. “I think the overall mood has changed,” Bruce says. “We’ve come a long way toward being more inclusive. Given the history of our school – which we carry around like baggage – we’ve come a long way.” What impact the university’s action will have on the rest of the state depends in large part on how lawmakers, who are divided on the issue, respond, he adds. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant has previously warned state lawmakers not to override a 2001 referendum in which residents overwhelmingly voted to keep the flag’s current design. Yet Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn, a major Republican figure in the state, has taken a position against the flag, which he called “a point of offense that needs to be removed.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/how-many-guns-are-in-america-state-secrecy-means-no-one-knows,"A majority of states actively restrict access to information on gun permits, the FBI must destroy background checks and Congress bans funding for research Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST The American Public Health Association will join the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in a national summit in Washington DC to tackle gun violence. They describe the issue as “one of the biggest public health issues facing America”. But you wouldn’t know it from looking at the state of gun research.  Ask one of the dozen or so active firearms researchers in the United States, and they won’t be able to answer the fundamental question: how many guns are in America? In addition to a 1996 ban on federal funding for firearms research that is cited as one of the most onerous obstacles to treating gun violence as a public health issue, states have passed dozens of laws in just the past five years that make once-public data on gun ownership confidential. The best available data comes from a private survey by the University of Chicago, not the federal government, and that is still an estimate, finding that 79 million US households have guns. Other surveys have estimated there are between 270 and 310m guns. “There are lots of holes in actually having any data on the number of guns in our communities,” said Fred Rivara, head of pediatrics at the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center and Seattle Children’s Hospital and a firearms researcher for almost three decades. “You look at, well, are people with mental health problems more likely to have guns, or are people with past problems more likely to have guns, we don’t know because we don’t have that data.” States have not made the job easier. From Florida to Maine to West Virginia to Wyoming, a variety of provisions have exempted concealed-carry permit data from public disclosure or stopped permitting altogether. For researchers, these provisions make it impossible to study guns within a given zip code or cohorts of owners who might have run-ins with the law. “The fact of the matter is we know how many people own cars, we know the identity of every car in the United States … Yet we don’t know who owns guns, and we don’t know how many guns there are in the United States,” said Rivara. “When I first started in gun research back in 1987, we could actually go down to the state capitol in Olympia [Washington] and identify through state records at that point who owns guns,” said Rivara. “That ability was subsequently removed.” As of 2013, 28 states, including Washington, don’t allow access to gun permit records. Some states, such as Vermont, Wyoming and Kansas, removed permitting requirements. Iowa has worked for years to make gun permit data more secretive. Two counties in the state lent the legislature a hand by destroying all permit applications. New York tightened public access to gun permits after a newspaper north of New York City published a map of permit holders’ names and addresses. In the past five years dozens of laws have exempted concealed-carry permits and applications and gun licenses from public disclosure or made them confidential. Take one state as an example: Louisiana. Louisiana has the second-worst firearms death rate in the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, topped only by Alaska. In 2013, 19.3 people per 100,000 died because of a firearms-related injury for every 100,000 people in the state. That rate is equivalent to 14.7 people dying at a single New Orleans Saints football game (where the stadium seats roughly 76,000). The same year, in addition to repealing state bans on machine guns, legislators made concealed-carry permit records confidential and allowed for issuance of lifetime concealed-carry permits. At its most basic level, that means researchers will never know how many concealed-carry permit holders, including those licensed for life, there are in the state. But that wasn’t far enough for legislators in the state. Louisiana lawmakers also made it a misdemeanor criminal offense to release information about concealed-carry permit holders – levying a $500 fine and up to six months in jail for any department of public safety and corrections employee who releases such records, and a $10,000 fine and six months in jail for anyone else who releases that information. Firearms dealers in Louisiana are also not required to retain background checks or sales records, meaning that if a dealer chooses not to record such transactions there is no way for researchers (or anyone else) to trace guns or oversee the efficacy of background checks. Some federal data has also disappeared. A firearms trace database operated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives once used to publicly shame gun retailers who sold to criminals was made confidential in the early 2000s. And the FBI is required to destroy all background checks. These state and federal restrictions have compounded challenges for the already-barren field of gun research, which has been barred from federal funding. In 2013, following the massacre of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, Barack Obama signed an executive order that was supposed to lift the ban on firearms research. Congress, however, turned down the president’s request to fund the research. In firearms violence research, this has been the state of affairs since 1996. At a time when gun violence was among the highest in American history, Congress defunded firearms research and passed a provision many researchers believe had a deep, chilling effect on the pursuit of answers. At the time, a series of papers funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became a hot-button issue after scientists began to view gun violence as a public health issue. One such paper was co-authored by Rivara in 1993. Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and found that gun owners were more likely to be the victims of homicide, than protected from it. This research drew particular ire in Congress. “We have here an attempt by the CDC, through the [National Center for Injury Prevention and Control] a disease control agency of the federal government [trying] to bring about gun control advocacy all over the United States,” Arkansas Republican representative Jay Dickey told colleagues during a hearing on his namesake amendment. The rider, stipulating that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the [CDC] may be used to advocate or promote gun control”, would stop research into gun violence for the next two decades. The CDC, Dickey argued, was trying “to raise emotional sympathy for those people who are for gun control”. Congress also yanked $2.6m in funding from the CDC, even as 1.1 million Americans fell victim to gun crime that year alone (In 2011, 439,100 were victims). Even Democrats acquiesced to Dickey’s amendment. Lobbying colleagues to restore funding, New York Democrat Nita Lowey told House colleagues: “Our amendment preserves language in the bill which prohibits the CDC from advocating or promoting gun control.” “The NRA opposes the CDC injury control research because it wants to suppress the awful truth about gun violence. The NRA simply does not want the facts getting out. It is no more than censorship. It must be stopped,” Lowey said. Despite her efforts, Dickey’s amendment passed, and firearms research ground to a halt. Nineteen years later, in the wake of a mass shooting inside a church in Charleston, South Carolina, Lowey lobbied for the removal of the same rider she had once been willing to live with to restore funding. “Preventing research because you worry about the outcome is cowardly,” she said at a hearing, before Congress re-upped (again) the requirement that the CDC not lobby for gun control. Now, despite $130m in “violence research” grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health, no studies explicitly looked at firearms. Nor did any of the $59m in grants devoted to “youth violence” or the $16m that went to “youth violence prevention”. “The lack of research has been so detrimental because not only do we not have the research funding, another thing I think that’s really important is that it’s been a huge blow to the trained workforce,” said Susan Sorenson, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who studies gun violence as a public health issue. In the United States, researchers are required to generate their own grant funding for projects, including for lab time, salaries and equipment. “If there’s no funding, that researcher simply is not going to have a job, so they go into fields that are more heavily funded – cancer, tobacco, HIV – simply because they too need to be able, like all humans, to eat, to have a place to live,” Sorenson said. As scientists struggle to rebuild a field Sorenson called “nascent”, some surprising funding streams have stepped forward. The Seattle city council funded research studying whether people who go to the hospital for gunshots were likely to later be the victims of violence (they are). The Chicago-based Joyce Foundation is cited by researchers as one of the only private foundations willing to provide money for research, and firearms researcher Dr Gary Wintemute donated about $1.1m of his own money to fund his research. “Better data, and data systems, are needed. Interventions must be evaluated, and those evaluations must help guide further efforts,” wrote Wintemute in an editorial for the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Until we revitalize firearm violence research, studies using available data will often be the best we have. They are not good enough.”"
http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123238/ben-carson-saying-all-right-things,"We are well past the point when anything that happens in the Republican presidential primary can qualify as surprising. A bigoted billionaire has led the race now for more than 100 days. The establishment favorite is crumbling in a heap of awkward moments and entitled whining. What once was up is now down, and has been for a while. That’s why I found it odd when the Washington Post's Chris Cilizza proclaimed that Ben Carson was the least-understood candidate on either side. The GOP establishment, he wrote, doesn’t “get” the appeal of the retired neurosurgeon who has been running second to Donald Trump—except in Iowa, where he’s first. In polls released over the last week, Carson has either an eight-, nine-, or 14-point lead over Trump in the state hosting the first nominating contest. It seems that Republican voters get Carson quite well, actually. On Tuesday morning, he surpassed Trump in one national poll, besting him 26 to 22 percent. Even establishment Republicans recognize that he's in position to win Iowa. Of course, they also know that the last two Republicans who won the caucuses were Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012, running campaigns that played heavily to both the far right and evangelicals (sound familiar?). Neither man came close to sniffing the nomination in the end. Republican voters see Carson not as a momentary entertainment like Herman Cain, but as a less-experienced version of Santorum and Huckabee, with a juicier biography, open expressions of Christian faith, and a quieter voice. This is working to Carson’s benefit because while Trump embodies the id of the Republican Party’s hardline voter base that Iowans have represented in an outsized manner, Carson is its superego, articulating what currently stands for its moral conscience with his quiet, even voice. When the doctor speaks during Wednesday night’s third Republican debate, we might have to strain a bit to hear, but be assured that he’s speaking on a frequency that the far right can hear loud and clear. Carson, who was once a very different kind of black conservative, has bought into what they’re selling. In a strategy that calls to mind Fox News more so than a political campaign, what he's doing to win is presenting black respectability politics while preaching the conservative word. It isn’t as hard to figure out as some think. Carson used to be a different kind of black conservative, one who stemmed from the Booker T. Washington tradition of black self-help amid the permanence of white racism. BuzzFeed this week flagged an excerpt from his 1999 book The Big Picture in which he wrote that white Americans have “no grasp on the history of racial violence in this country.” But now that he’s a politician, he hasn’t sold out so much as he’s bought in, serving up inappropriate and ahistorical slavery and Holocaust metaphors and ludicrous policies to cater to Republican voters. The saddest part is that he’s trashing his legacy, most likely, only to win Iowa and get a brief, almost certainly unsustainable ride atop the polls. Carson, once an iconoclast, is now a parrot for the hard right. The guy who seems to be misunderstanding Carson’s appeal the most, frankly, is Trump himself. He out-and-out said it during a rally last Saturday in Jacksonville: “I don't know what the hell is going on there. I don't get it!"" The real-estate magnate also made light of the doctor’s perceived lack of energy and verbally sub-tweeted Carson’s Seventh Day Adventist faith, a denomination that religious scholar Anthea Butler told CNN doesn’t typically get involved with politics and “veer[s] off of traditional mainline Christianity.” That was probably a clapback at Carson for paraphrasing Proverbs 22:4 in an earlier attack against Trump’s faith. At an Anaheim rally in September, Carson had called his faith the ""big differentiator"" between him and Trump. “Probably the biggest thing—I've realized where my success has come from and I don't in any way deny my faith in God,” he said. “By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life and that's a very big part of who I am. I don't get that impression with him. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't get that."" While Muslims are still waiting for their mea culpa from Carson for his insistence that none of them should be president of the United States, Trump got an apology—but isn’t giving one in return. That’s probably OK, though, since Carson’s true doctrine isn’t so much Christianity as it is conservative fundamentalism. That creed also, it seems, holds that women who seek abortions are equivalent to slave masters. That’s the analogy Carson drew on Sunday’s episode of “Meet the Press.” Before he told Chuck Todd that he’d like to see Roe v. Wade overturned, he said, “During slavery—and I know that's one of those words you're not supposed to say, but I'm saying it—during slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, 'I don't believe in slavery. I think it's wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do'? Where would we be?” The comparison is insulting and historically incongruous, but that’s been Carson’s lane throughout this campaign. He went to the slavery-metaphor well once before, declaring that the Affordable Care Act was the worst thing since—and just as notably, said after the recent mass shooting at an Oregon community college that the Holocaust would have been less likely had Jewish people been fighting back with firearms. Yes, all of that is ridiculous, but not to like Iowa Republican caucus-goers, who give him an 84 percent approval rating. Carson, as USA Today reported, had only two negatives with these voters, including the use of fetal tissue during his medical career. Not even Ben Carson can be a perfect modern-day conservative. He is trying, though. Last Thursday, Politico reported that the doctor wants to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid, offering in their place “cradle-to-grave savings accounts” that would be funded by the government to the tune of a measly $2,000 per year and making every family “their own insurance company,” in his words. This is something Carson brought up two years ago at the National Prayer Breakfast, when he made a splash by criticizing President Obama from a few feet away. Carson buttered folks up for the Medicare and Medicaid proposals with a National Review op-ed in July, in which he claimed that “the majority of Americans are unhappy with Obamacare and would prefer something that is simple, effective, and under their own control.” It’s one of the strongest anti-government ideas yet put forth by a Republican in this campaign cycle. Nationwide, it is typically bad politics, even for Republicans, to propose that 49 million people be tossed off of their health insurance and given national savings accounts. But thus far, Carson has been the Teflon Doc, with no consequences. The stuff that has torpedoed Santorum and Huckabee in the past and present has not hurt him. Part of it is simply because people like the dude. “Dr. Carson's personality and likeability causes people to cut him some slack,” former McCain campaign manager Charlie Black told NBC News last week. “He comes from outside the political world, where what you say and your observations are more like someone in the public sphere.” Other voters told reporter Alexandra Jaffe that they respect that Carson ""loves the Lord,” and said they find him “very refreshing, very inspiring—even his stances on race in this country, that we need to be getting people to work together and love their neighbors.” A lifelong Democrat told Jaffe that Carson was someone she could see herself voting for, because he “sounds very smart and has helped children.” We cannot discount the degree to which respectability politics plays into this. As I’ve written before, Carson is a Horatio Alger myth come to life, and the willfully incomplete Republican framing of racial strife in America only serves to buttress his legend as a Black Man Who Did It On His Own And Didn’t Make Excuses. But one thing I didn’t mention is what sociology professor Tressie McMillan Cottom aptly noted in The Atlantic, which crosses racial lines: the public’s assumption that being smart in one capacity is an indication of overall (specifically political) intelligence. I suspect that Carson's ridiculous platform and lack of foreign-policy specifics will catch up to him—perhaps as soon as Wednesday’s debate, given that he’s now more of a target for Trump and the other candidates. But Carson will likely still sound like the reasonable one, even as insanity drips from his lips. Even when impassioned, he rarely sounds excited. He spouted about abortion and slavery with the cadence one might use to read a grocery list. We associate Trump's hyperbolic manner with performance, but Carson is also performing something: earnestness. Perhaps he actually believes all the stuff he says, but Carson is proving that even the most politically extreme African American can sound reasonable to some folks when he speaks so well, and so articulately. The column originally stated that Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses in the wrong years. The error has been corrected.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Ojhrb-Tscfo/,"President Barack Obama thanked police officers on Tuesday for the work they’ve done to reduce the overall crime rate across the U.S., but said that work doesn’t reduce the need for a “robust debate” over fairness in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. In the wake of last year’s police shootings in Ferguson and New York, communities of color haven’t shied away from expressing their discontent for the way they are treated under the law. At the same time, officers have gone on the defensive about the scrutiny they are under and the dangers they face while on the job. Speaking before the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago, Obama did his best to meet both sides in the middle. “I reject any narrative that seeks to divide police and communities they serve; that frames any discussion of public safety around ‘us’ and ‘them’–a narrative that too often gets served up to us by cable news seeking ratings, tweets seeking retweets, or political candidates seeking some attention,” President Obama. “Your work –your service – really has helped make America safer than it’s been in decades. That’s something of which every American should be proud.” Yet, Obama said, that work shouldn’t keep either side of the debate speaking honestly about criminal justice and law enforcement issues. There’s been some movement on the topic, including among officers, as of late. Last week a group of police chiefs, including Chicago Police Chief Garry McCarthy, came out in support of criminal justice reforms they said would improve their ability to crack down on crime. The conversation on policing has revealed some differences in opinion within the Obama administration over the past couple of days, with FBI Director James Comey saying some police officers may be afraid to do their jobs with the public more apt to record their every move. “I spoke to officers privately in one big city precinct who described being surrounded by young people with mobile phone cameras held high, taunting them the moment they get out of their cars,” Comey said last week at the University of Chicago. “They told me, ‘We feel like we’re under siege and we don’t feel much like getting out of our cars.’ ” The White House has rejected that assertion, saying the “available body of evidence does not support the notion that law enforcement officers around the country are shying away from doing their jobs.” Obama tiptoed into a discussion on the issue of increased scrutiny on police by suggesting that the media does officers a disservice by focusing attention on instances of wrongdoing. “Let’s face it, the media tends to focus on the sensational and the controversial and folks on both sides who say stuff that’s not designed to bring folks together,” he said. He added that society needs to “resist the impulse” to lurch from shock to scrutiny and “let investigations uncover facts to make sure stories of misconduct are not spread are not known.” The statement came just hours after the Department of Justice announced it would be investigating an incident involving a school resource officer who can be seen throwing an African American girl to the ground in a now-viral video. The past 12 months have provided for some tense moments between police and the communities they serve, but some of the most tragic events the nation has faced Obama said Tuesday have involved guns. According to White House officials, Obama met with the spouses and children of law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty and families of bystander victims of gun violence in Chicago before his speech. The President used his remarks at Tuesday’s event to make a strong case for changes to the nation’s gun laws—an issue he’s had to revisit in the wake of the recent mass shooting on the campus of Umpqua Community College and the Emanuel church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. “I refuse to accept the notion that we couldn’t have prevented some of those murders, and suicides, and kept more families whole. If we had passed some common sense laws,” Obama said. “Fewer gun safety laws don’t mean more freedom, they mean more danger, more fallen officers. More Americans terrified that their families could be next.” Obama also cited some statistics that compare the number of Americans killed by guns and terrorists since 9/11–during that time, he said, 400,000 Americans have been shot and killed by guns while fewer than 100 have been murdered by terrorists on U.S. soil. “400,000,” he said. “That’s like losing the entire population of Cleveland or Minneapolis over the past 14 years.” The remarks were the President’s latest focusing on criminal justice reform, coming on the heels of a sit down with The Marshall Project last Thursday and an emotional visit to the center of the heroin epidemic. Criminal justice is one of the key issues Obama is hoping to tackle during his second term and one of the few that has been met with some bipartisan agreement among lawmakers. Obama said Tuesday he hoped the momentum around criminal justice reform remains strong and laid out his case for it, including restructuring sentencing guidelines for some non-violent drug crimes. Obama has also used criminal justice and law enforcement issues as a channel into wider discussions on race. At Tuesday’s event, Obama reiterated statements he’s made previously calling on communities of color to give officers the benefit of the doubt, while also urging law enforcement to take seriously the cries of minorities who say they’re too often treated unfairly under the law. He also touted a newly released set of guidelines on how law enforcement agencies can implement suggestions from the 21st Century Police Task Force report. “You know as well as I do the tensions in some communities…those sentiments don’t just come out of nowhere,” Obama said. “There’s a long history here in this country…but we all have a responsibility to do something about it.”  Contact us at letters@time.com."

October 28, 2015 After a steady string of mass shootings and a revival of the political fight over gun control, Americans are slightly more likely than they were two years ago to say gun laws should be made stricter, a new Associated Press-GfK poll found. Despite the uptick in favor of tighter gun laws, Americans remain deeply divided along party, gender and geographic lines on an issue that has ricocheted into the presidential campaign. Eight in 10 Democrats favor stricter gun laws, while 6 in 10 Republicans want them left as they are or loosened. Still, the results show the calls for tighter laws have some bipartisan appeal, with 37 percent of Republicans, including 31 percent of conservative Republicans, favoring stricter gun laws. The new poll was taken two weeks after the shooting rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, thrust the discussion of gun control into the country's attention and the presidential campaign. Polls regularly find a rise in support for tighter gun laws after such shootings — although that support often levels off as the headlines fade. In December 2013, one year after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., 52 percent of Americans said gun laws should be made tighter. That number was 58 percent in the new poll, while 27 percent said they think laws should be left as they are and 12 percent favored making gun laws less strict. Over a third of Americans said gun laws should be made much stricter, up from 29 percent who said so in the 2013 poll. And they were slightly less inclined to see laws limiting gun ownership as an infringement on the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. Forty-five percent saw such laws as an infringement; 51 percent did not. In the 2013 poll, 50 percent said gun laws infringe on the right to bear arms and 47 percent said they did not. Gun control has become one of the top issues in the Democratic presidential primary, as front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised to take executive action to expand background checks and accused Republicans of bowing to the powerful gun lobby. President Barack Obama has said he plans to use his bully pulpit to press lawmakers to pass tougher laws, although there's little sign of momentum in the Republican-run Congress. The poll finds Democratic politicians are in line with their party's loyalists. Democrats are more likely than Republicans — 69 percent to 55 percent — to say gun laws are very or extremely important to them. ""The idea of being able to have a concealed weapon on a college campus is frightening to me, absolutely frightening to me,"" said Mary Robins, a retired career counselor in Menlo Park, California, who said she favored a ban on assault-type weapons and restricting access to large magazines. Robins was among the 66 percent of women who said gun laws should be made stricter, compared with 50 percent of men. Women also were more likely to give the issue high priority. ""I think we need to enforce the ones we have and prosecutors and judges should be getting tougher,"" said Harry Masse, a 59-year-old police chief in Metropolis, Illinois. City and suburban dwellers are more likely to back tighter laws than rural Americans. Americans are equally divided over which party they trust to do a better job handling the issue. Twenty-nine percent say they trust the Republicans more and 27 percent trust the Democrats more, while 13 percent say they trust both equally. An additional 30 percent say they trust neither party on handling the issue. Obama received notably tough marks on the issue, even from some in his own party. The president made a push for a tighter gun laws in 2013, but failed to persuade Congress. He then issued several executive actions, but until recently has sidelined the issue. Six in 10 Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue, the new poll finds, including 35 percent of Democrats. ""I don't think he's done enough,"" said Ryan Dupont, a college professor in from Smithfield, Utah. He said he understands Obama must work with ""less-than-ideal"" people in Congress but ""I think that issue needs to be moved more aggressively."" Addressing a group of law enforcement leaders from around the country Tuesday, President Obama suggested that police officers don’t deserve the bad rap they sometimes face and that they are too often blamed for social and cultural matters outside their control. In his prepared remarks to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Mr. Obama also made a case for tougher gun regulations as part of his broader criminal justice reform campaign. Inadequate gun laws, he says, are one of many factors that have lead American society to mistakenly antagonize cops as the culprit for inequality, reported The Christian Science Monitor. Unchanged since 2013 is the share of Americans living in a household where at least one person owns a gun — about one-third. About half of Republicans live in households with a gun, compared with less than a third of Democrats or independents.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/120969605/0/phoenix/politics~McSally-pushes-bill-on-gun-background-checks/,"U.S. Rep. Martha McSally is joining a handful of Republicans daring to touch an issue that has bitterly divided Congress: background checks for gun-buyers. McSally, R-Ariz., who represents the Tucson-area district where a deranged gunman ended Gabrielle Giffords’ congressional career, says her legislation wouldn't expand background checks but would improve them, as well as mental-health treatment to reduce gun violence. A rare alliance has coalesced around the freshman’s bill including politicians on both sides of the aisle, mental-health advocates, law enforcement and even an activist whose late husband was injured in the mass shooting near Tucson. While McSally's approach has drawn praise from an array of supporters, it has also drawn rebukes from gun-control advocates including Giffords' own organization. “I’m looking for where can we find common ground,” McSally told The Arizona Republic. “We know we have a problem. We have to find good solutions to try and fix it.” Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group Giffords founded after the 2011 mass shooting, and other gun-control organizations warn the legislation is a smokescreen. The National Rifle Association endorsed it for a reason, the organization says. “This bill does much more harm than it does good,” Americans for Responsible Solutions Director Peter Ambler said in an interview. “The sum effect of the legislation is a weakening of the background-check system.” The Mental Health and Safe Communities Act tackles three problems, McSally said: States’ spotty performance reporting orders banning mentally ill people from buying guns to the background-check system. The bill would direct more federal grant money to states that achieve a 90-percent reporting goal, while shrinking grants to states that fail to meet that standard.The law-enforcement pipeline that funnels the mentally ill into jails and prisons. The bill would encourage state and local jurisdictions to divert more people with mental illness to residential treatment centers and substance-abuse programs.The need for police, firefighters, judges and school workers to better respond to people in crisis. The bill would provide more specialized training and crisis-intervention teams around the country. The legislation, first introduced in the Senate by the powerful Texas Republican John Cornyn, would use existing grants, requiring no new funding. McSally acknowledges the bill would make modest reforms but argues it could be a step in the right direction, after attempts to tighten background checks and improve mental health have stalled in Washington. She credited a bipartisan mental-health bill by Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Penn., for helping to show her the way. “When tragedies like this happen, you’ve got on the one side: ‘We want more gun control and ... we want to potentially infringe on the Second Amendment of law-abiding citizens,’” McSally said. “And on the other side: It’s basically do nothing. ... They get in their corners and are not willing to budge.” Efforts to expand gun rights are more common among McSally's Republican colleagues, such as Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, whose bill this month would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. But pro gun-control critics of the bill say increasing access to firearms is exactly what McSally’s bill does. The mental-health proposals are helpful but distract from the larger problem, they say. “Yes, there are some parts of this bill that do good things. … (But) all of the provisions in this bill regarding guns weaken the law,” said Pia Carusone, senior adviser to Americans for Responsible Solutions. “They have used (the mental-health provisions) to try to convince people that this is a good bill.” Everytown for Gun Safety, another advocacy group, called the bill ""nothing more than sleight of hand."" The legislation would strip away current punishments for states that fail to submit mental-health orders to the background-check system, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence concluded. The McSally bill would make cuts to grants optional and label states compliant if they promise to do better. McSally staffers counter that the penalties aren't being enforced at all right now and the bill would add incentives for states to comply. Critics also worry the bill loosens criteria for prohibiting gun possession, allowing some people to regain the right as soon as their medical orders expire instead of having to petition a judge. “You could go from the mental institution to the gun store, which we think is dangerous,” Ambler said. An analysis from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service raises that possibility. ""The bill could potentially narrow the number of people who qualify"" for gun bans due to mental illness and remove their records from the background-check system, the report says. McSally staffers disagree. The bill doesn't get rid of current law requiring people who are committed to mental institutions to petition for their rights, they argue, but instead establishes factors officials can consider when restoring gun rights. Two Democrats campaigning for McSally's seat in 2016 said the mental-health parts of the bill are positive. But physician Matt Heinz and state Rep. Victoria Steele, a counselor, said the legislation would not prevent gun violence. Besides the four Democrats and three other Republicans co-sponsoring McSally's bill, backers include the National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Association of Police Organizations, National Association of Social Workers, American Correctional Association, the National Sports Shooting Foundation . In southern Arizona, it is supported by Democratic Tucson Councilman Steve Kozachik, executives at mental-health centers and Sallie Badger, whose husband Bill Badger tackled the Tucson shooter while wounded. Before he died this year of natural causes, the Badgers were advocates for tighter background checks. “I commend Martha for her efforts to help prevent instances of gun violence,” Sallie Badger said in a statement. “Bill was about bringing both sides together and showing that this is an issue we can be united on, and I’m glad to see Martha carrying on his work in that spirit.” But if McSally wanted to prevent gun violence in a bipartisan way, she could act on a position she took on the campaign trail, advocates from Americans for Responsible Solutions say. McSally revealed last year that as a survivor of stalking she would back partially closing the “stalker gap"" in background checks. She announced her position after Americans for Responsible Solutions aired a hard-hitting television ad against her on the issue. The group, which spent $2 million seeking to defeat McSally, canceled the ad after criticism. The congresswoman should fulfill her campaign position, Carusone said. “Here we have a glaring gap in federal law that allows stalkers to hang onto their firearms,” she said. “You said you’d be involved in fixing it.” McSally told The Republic that she doesn’t plan to join a bipartisan bill in Congress to shut the stalker loophole. “Arizona law already covers that. It’s not a focus of what we’re trying to get done,” she said. Arizona law prohibits people convicted of felony stalking from gun possession. Those with misdemeanor records are unaffected. McSally argued she is responding to her district's concerns with her bill. ""I'll continue to listen to my constituents,"" she said. ""There a whole lot of things people are deeply concerned about."""

It's the 25th anniversary of the magazine's awards, aimed at celebrating women achievers, trailblazers and newsmakers from entertainment, fashion, politics and business. “Since 1990, Glamour’s Women of the Year Awards have saluted the planet’s most remarkable female leaders, and this year’s winners are no exception,” said Leive in a statement. “They have been inspired and led by the generations of Women of the Year before them, and Glamour is thrilled to celebrate their passion.” The awards ceremony, with Amy Schumer as the opener, will be at Carnegie Hall in New York City on Nov. 9, the same day Mayor Bill de Blasio will proclaim as Women of the Year Day for the city. Also, Leive and Copeland will light the Empire State Building tower in Glamour pink to symbolize women around the world who continue to break barriers. Some excerpts from the story in the December issue, on newsstands Nov. 10. Witherspoon, on the magazine's December cover, is being honored as the Hollywood Hero, for co-founding a production company aimed at film projects with female protagonists (Wild and Gone Girl were winners): “I have this drive from my upbringing to be a doer, not just a complainer,"" she says. ""I have achieved a certain amount of success, and I felt a responsibility to my daughter and to women in this world to create more opportunities for women."" Jenner is the Transgender Champion. “I started thinking, Maybe this is why God put me on earth,"" she says. ""This issue has been swept under the rug for so long. I need to tell this story on the highest level you can possibly do it. Not just for me but for this entire community.” Richards is the Health Advocate, for stressing Planned Parenthood's delivery of health services to millions of women, and for refusing to back down in the face of threats by Congress to defund the organization. “There’s not a mother in the world who wants her daughter to have fewer rights than she did — and for me, it’s the 2.7 million people Planned Parenthood serves each year who make everything I advocate for possible,"" she says. The U.S. national women's soccer team are the Game Changers, for not just winning the FIFA Women’s World Cup but dominating it. “We have the trifecta,"" says Coach Jill Ellis. ""We have the technique, we have the athleticism, and we have the mentality. There are very few teams in the world that have all three of those. That’s what tips the scales for us to win.” Beckham is the Fashion Force, for building an empire out of a first collection of just 10 dresses, then going on to become a philanthropist and mother of four. “I did have to find myself and my confidence,"" she says. ""And I want to make other women feel the best version of themselves. That’s the same message as the Spice Girls. It’s still Girl Power."" Copeland is the Showstopper, the first African-American ballerina to be named principal dancer dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. Meanwhile, her memoir became a best-seller and even her commercial for Under Armour went viral. “Generations of black women and men didn’t have a fair chance in the ballet world; it’s still difficult to be ‘other.’ Understanding that made me want to speak up and represent what so many couldn’t.” Holmes is the Entrepreneur for building blood-testing company Theranos and becoming, at age 31, the youngest self-made female billionaire in the world. “I think every bad thing you could possibly experience in trying to do something like this, we have experienced. But we know why we are doing it — people are counting on us because of what (his technology) means to a cancer patient, what it means to someone who has no ability to afford health care."" The Women of Charleston are The Peacemakers for responding to a mass shooting in a black city church with the healing strength of peace and unity. “I know it sounds so juvenile, like everybody holding hands and singing ‘Kumbaya.’ But I still believe that we can do it. It can’t just be an I, it can’t just be black people, it can’t just be white people, it can’t just be poor people, it can’t just be victims. It needs to be we. As in: we the people,” says Alana Simmons, who lost her grandfather in the shooting and launched the #HateWontWin initiative."

Update 5/10/16 12:38 p.m.: The Armor of Light will air on Tuesday, May 10 at 8 p.m. eastern on PBS, followed by a town hall examining gun violence across the country. Evangelical Pastor Rob Schenck was a radical anti-abortion activist who hadn’t put too much thought into gun rights. But rattled by a mass shooting at Washington’s Navy Yard, something inside him shifted; he soon began to question gun culture from a moral standpoint and later preached about the human cost of gun violence instead. His pivot drew the attention of filmmaker Abigail Disney, grandniece of legendary entertainment mogul Walt Disney. In her gripping directorial debut, The Armor of Light, Disney follows Schenck’s self-exploration into the muddied world of gun control in America. Disney accompanies Schenck to shooting ranges, a National Rifle Association convention, and even a memorable meeting with Lucia McBath, whose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed at a Florida gas station. Along the way, she finds herself wading with Schenck into a moral conflict at the heart of the debate: whether it’s possible to be both anti-abortion and pro-gun. Mother Jones spoke with Disney about her family’s relationship with the NRA, her friendship with Schenck, and how the documentary shaped her own views on the polarizing gun debate. Mother Jones: At the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival this summer, you mentioned you had a completely different documentary in mind. What was that original idea, and how did it shift to the documentary you eventually made? Abigail Disney: It was that conservatives and conservative values aren’t really reflected in the radical values of the NRA. And the other idea was that the NRA is not what you think it is: It’s an evolving, ever-changing organization, and it has not always been this radical, right-wing arm of the Republican Party, and that the history of the NRA is in fact really interesting. All of that really fell away because there’s a real difference between a documentary that was all about facts and history and information. People just don’t get as engaged in that kind of documentary—they don’t fall in love, they don’t cry, they don’t forget who they are, they don’t ride with you. As we realized we had richer, vérité kind of people, what we wanted to do is focus in on the vérité story. MJ: That original idea delved more into your own family background. Can you tell me a bit about that? AD: That’s right. I almost forgot about that. When I sat there in 1971 and watched my grandfather open Walt Disney World, I was a little 11-year-old girl who worshiped the ground he walked on. You probably couldn’t have found much daylight between the NRA and the Disney company. They probably would’ve had had identical demographics for the people who really loved those companies. Then in 2008, in Florida, you have them up against each other in a court, because one of the Disney employees has decided to, because he’s an NRA member, challenge Disney’s no-gun policy for employees. How does it happen in not very long, 38 years, that you go from two companies with almost identical constituencies to fighting each other in a court of law about a fundamental issue?  MJ: What drew you then to Rob Schenck’s story in particular? AD: While we were looking at how we were going to talk about Florida, that’s how we met Lucy McBath. We met Rob, and he was such an interesting story. His whole life was interesting. He ended up being such an eloquent man and a deeply thoughtful and sweet person, which was not what I expected when I first met him. That upended the whole project. MJ: Why choose this evangelical pastor as the subject through which you’re examining the national gun control debate? AD: There are very few people who have committed more to the pro-life discourse than Rob has. He’s spent time in jail. He has really lived it. He has committed everything he’s had to it. If in fact he believes that every human life was sacred, I knew that if he had his conscious awakened, I knew he wouldn’t be able to close his eyes to it. MJ: Was he receptive to you focusing on his internal debate? AD: Oh my God, yeah. It’s a tough subject for him to talk about. It was almost all risk and not a lot of reward. But he recognized that right out of the gate, because he knows how high feelings run on this issue. He saw the writing on the wall. Yeah, of course, he was reluctant. We met over dinner in Union Station in Washington. We had a three-hour conversation that first time. And he said, “Thanks a lot. Now I have to go home and think about this. I’m going to go pray on this and we’ll get in touch.” [Laughs.] I checked with him every Monday for five weeks, and every week he would say, “I’m still praying.” By the end of the five weeks, I was pretty sure he was going to say no [to being in the documentary]. So I was pretty shocked when he said, “There’s a deep moral failing in the center of my community, and I can’t pretend I don’t see it anymore. So with or without you I have to go forward.” MJ: How did you get him to agree to let you act as a fly on the wall as he went through this self-exploration? AD: I keep wondering if everybody on the political left had someone who they were separated at birth from. Wouldn’t that be interesting if that were true? Once we got to know each other, we had such similar impulses. We saw in a similar way, and we developed a strong friendship. We would talk on the phone for hours, philosophically and theologically, about all of these issues. Around the edges of the film, this lovely friendship started to form. And that’s why he was willing to trust me. He signed a release right away, and I said to him, “I think you’re signing this because you’re afraid you’ll chicken out.” And he said yes. [Laughs.] He could’ve stopped cooperating, but he trusted me. I feel so grateful for that. MJ: You mentioned that you and Rob disagreed on a few things. Did that disagreement factor into the documentary at all? AD: It didn’t, but it impacted the world around the edges of the documentary, and it continues to affect us. Now that we have a friendship, we can engage in those issues. It’s not like dropping an atomic bomb in the middle of everything because we’ll stay friends no matter how we disagree. We do tease each about the things we disagree about. I don’t judge him, and he doesn’t judge me. It’s powerfully important for me as a pro-choice person and person who supports Planned Parenthood to have Rob accept me as not a baby-killing horrible person. That’s actually a massive step away from his original position, and he’s taking a lot of heat in his world just for being my friend, just for hanging around with me. MJ: One of the most poignant moments in the documentary was the one when Lucy [McBath] meets Rob at his place. How did that moment come together? AD: I get very close to people when I’m shooting them. We would go and shoot a scene with Lucy, and I would spend the whole time telling her about Rob. Then I would go shoot a scene with Rob and tell him all about Lucy. Eventually they wanted to know each other. These are two people who would never have overlapped in any other way or context. We brought to the garden at Rob’s office and just sat and watched what unfolded. I remember weeping behind the camera, because I was so moved by the way they connected. MJ: What is Rob Schenck up to now? How has his life changed since the documentary’s release? AD: He’s definitely lost funders to his not-for-profit. He’s lost friendships. He’s a really relational person, so that’s really hard on him. He takes that personally. He’s been surprised by the amount of support we’ve gotten. I’ll tell you: I’ve taken heat from lefties. It’s like, “How dare you let these people speak for themselves? How dare you not make fun of them? You let Rob off too easily for his abortion work. You don’t show us the whole depth of what a horrible person he is. Why are you letting him off so easy?” I’ve taken it from feminist friends, and I’ve taken it from lefty friends too. But that reassures me. If the right is attacking us and the left is attacking us, that’s exactly where we want to be. MJ: Do you and Rob still differ in the way you approach gun control issues? AD: He would talk about it as an Evangelical. I could develop every argument that I had for gun control, but I could never have done what Rob did, which was to say: In respecting the Second Amendment, you have to be very careful not to violate the Second Commandment. Only an evangelical could’ve arrived at that. When you say the Second Commandment, you will not take any image before me, which means you can’t worship the image or the crucifix itself. You have to worship God. When you worship an idol, you’re substituting a thing for the ultimate. So therefore, in worshipping the Second Amendment and taking your orders from the Constitution over and above your orders from the Bible, are you in fact violating the Second Commandment? Evangelical ears perk up when you suggest the Second Commandment is being violated. That gets their attention. I never would’ve known that nuance about these people, so [Rob’s] able to get under their skin in a way that I never could have.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/31/journalists-bad-halloween-pseudonyms-ruin-twitter,"Media Twitter is regularly hilarious, but making name puns around holidays makes it hard to tell who you are when news breaks Last modified on Sat 31 Oct 2015 10.31 GMT I love Twitter. I really do. It’s a beautiful, wild, democratic experiment; a place for conversation to soar. It is the true spiritual successor to the Viennese coffee-houses of Wittgenstein and Freud, or the Left Bank bars in which Hemingway and Fitzgerald caroused. It is at turns hilarious and intense, as breaking news in real-time jostles with wordplay. Despite its financial woes, I’m not alone in finding it intoxicating. But in the run-up to Halloween, Twitter is ruined; rendered practically unusable by people of the journalistic persuasion changing their names to twee, confusing, un-funnily spooky almost-puns.  This is not just because it’s insufferably twee, although it is. Nor is it simply that for these few weeks it becomes next-to impossible to work out who the blazes is saying what, though it does. A quick scan of my timeline shows me that my colleagues Alex Hern and Sam Thielman – serious, well-respected reporters both – have become “Pumpkin Spiced Hern” (what?) and “Swam Thingman,” the latter of which puts me most in mind of late South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond more than anything else. “You could probably argue that the part of me that enjoys seeing Twitter automatically populate an article with the byline Swam Thingman or Sam T Claus is a part that shouldn’t be encouraged (you could also argue that I could do better in the name-pun department),” Thingman said. “But I’ll quote Madeleine L’Engle in my defense: the only way to treat something deadly serious is to make a little light of it.” Look, Swam, and Pumpkin, and Hallow’Ann and Willaaaaargh: I’m not trying to suck all of the fun out of Media Twitter. It’s lots of fun – wordsmiths addicted to the news cycle make for engrossing repartee. Thingman also pointed out this tremendous correction in no less an organ than the New York Times on the subject of the Jillian York, who works against censorship as the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation: “An earlier version of a tweet in this column misstated the name of its writer. As her Twitter handle correctly noted, she is Jillian C. York, not Chillian J. Yikes! (That is a pseudonym she created for Halloween).” This is certainly funny, I’ll grant you. But it’s also an example of the sort of misunderstandings that can happen in this season of confusion. And that can easily become problematic. When something bad happens – that’s when Media Twitter is at its best (though also, sometimes, its worst). People seek information. People try to disseminate truth. Of course, Twitter doesn’t always get it right. But it’s journalism. We strive to be better. What I can’t get out of my head is this: what if – God forbid, but what if – something big happens on Halloween? There is a mass shooting event, on average, every day in the United States. When people turn to journalists for answers, what does it look like for serious news to be coming from someone whose Twitter name is “Spooky Ghost Steve” or some equally egregious attempt at levity? It’s just not a great optic. You wouldn’t want to see Brian Williams reporting grimly on a plane crash while wearing a sparkly conical party hat, tipped slightly askew. It looks callous. It is callous. It’s time we admit the truth: changing your name on Twitter to a scary pun for Halloween is some basic garbage. But, if you still want to do it, Gawker has published this handy guide."

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/us/4-students-arrested-in-northern-california-suspected-of-plotting-killings-in-high-school.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Liam Stack Four Northern California high school students have been arrested in connection with what law enforcement officials called a highly detailed plan to shoot and kill fellow students and teachers, just days after a mass shooting on a community college campus in rural Oregon. The four, all students at Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif., “were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible at the campus,” Sheriff James W. Mele of Tuolumne County said at a news conference on Saturday. Sheriff Mele did not identify the students other than to say all were male juveniles. Tuolumne is about 120 miles east of San Francisco. Investigators have found no clear motive for the planned attack, Sheriff Mele said, but he said that “the suspects’ plans were very detailed in nature and included names of would-be victims, locations and methods in which the plan was to be carried out.” The students planned to open fire during an event at school, he said, and “were in the process of trying to obtain these weapons.” Officials said the plot was foiled on Wednesday when a group of students alerted a teacher after they overheard three of the four discussing a plan to open fire on the school. The teacher immediately told school administrators, who quickly removed the three from their classrooms and called the police, said Robert Griffith, the superintendent of the Summerville Union High School District. Sheriff Mele said the fourth suspect had been identified during the investigation. “Within two to three minutes, those administrators got up out of their seat, recognizing the severity of the information that they received, and were in the classroom pulling those students out,” Mr. Griffith said at the news conference. An “immediate” search of the students’ lockers by administrators turned up no weapons, Mr. Griffith said, “so within a very, very short period of time we knew that we did not have an immediate threat to safety.” Nevertheless, Sheriff Mele said the plot had been “pretty doggone close” to fruition. The investigation has so far been based on interviews with the suspects, during which they gave a detailed confession, Sheriff Mele said. The police executed two search warrants and seized the suspects’ electronic devices, he said, but have not yet analyzed their contents. The students were ordered to leave the school that day, and their parents were notified and are cooperating in the investigation, he said. He praised the parents for their help during “a very trying time” for their families and called their assistance “a key element” in foiling the plot. None of the suspects were allowed to return to school between their removal Wednesday afternoon and their arrest on Friday, Mr. Griffith said. The parents of students whose names appeared on a list of targets have not yet been notified, Sheriff Mele said. The four suspects were taken into custody at their homes and transported to the Tuolumne County Probation Department, and then to a juvenile detention center in another county, he said. Eric Hovatter, an assistant district attorney, said his office would file charges based on evidence from the investigation. “It is clear from past history such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against students and teachers on school grounds,” Mr. Hovatter said. “While it is easy to say that could never happen in Tuolomne County, the public and local law enforcement must remain vigilant, as they did here.” “That the suspects are young does not minimize the gravity of the conduct nor the potential for great harm to many innocent people,” he added.

The death of the gunman, previously identified by law-enforcement authorities as 26-year-old Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer, has been ruled a suicide by state investigators, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin announced in a news conference. He once again refused to speak the gunman’s name. Police had earlier said Harper-Mercer died amid an exchange of gunfire with authorities responding to the shooting Thursday morning at Umpqua Community College, but had said it was unclear whether he died by his own hand or as a result of shots fired by officers. Stephanie Salas, the mother of a student who was shot in the hand, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the gunman shot himself some 20 seconds before officers rushed into his room. Salas said her son, Rand McGowan, recounted that the gunman was ranting as he fired shots at students, and told them, “I am going to join you soon enough” before later turning a gun on himself.

http://fusion.net/story/211075/senate-democrats-gun-control-proposal-loophole-background-checks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=/feed/,"Be on the lookout for great stories from Fusion, right to your inbox. Guns http://fus.in/1ZfVjki Copied to clipboard Senate Democrats are poised to introduce a sweeping set of gun reforms on Thursday, and they’re ready to fight for it, too. The package includes elements of several other failed gun reform efforts, like a proposal to close the loophole that allows people purchasing firearms from private sellers or gun show vendors to skirt background check requirements and another to extend the window of time the F.B.I. has to conduct a background check before the purchaser is approved by default. (Under current law, if the background check takes longer than three days, the sale is automatically allowed to proceed. This loophole is what allowed Charleston shooter Dylann Roof to legally obtain a gun.) The bill is kind of the policy equivalent of Frankenstein’s monster, if Frankenstein’s monster was actually really good, and people really liked it, and it also had the capacity to prevent gun deaths every year. That’s the good news. The bad news is that this sensible reform package—provisions on gun safety that the overwhelming majority of American people, including gun owners, support—is utterly and unmistakably doomed. It stands little to no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. It stands even less of a chance of being taken up by the House, where the Republican majority is even stronger. Senate Democrats know this, and are pushing ahead anyway. “I’ve started to reach out to senators and talk about what can be done to advance the cause of background checks while Republicans are in charge for the next year or so,” Minority Leader Harry Reid said earlier this week. “But one thing is clear. To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as puppets of the N.R.A.” Though passing reform doesn’t seem politically possible in this Congress, Democrats are intent on getting their Republican colleagues on the record as opposing basic gun safety provisions that their constituents support. They have also indicated that they will block votes on other bills until the Senate takes up the reform package. It’s spectacle. It’s not going to help the bill pass. And it’s exactly what proponents of gun reform should be doing. The last time lawmakers collectively dedicated this kind of energy to gun safety was in 2013, after Adam Lanza brought four of the firearms from his 11 gun arsenal to Sandy Hook Elementary and murdered 20 children and six adults. As the country reeled from such incomprehensible violence, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers—led by Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Patrick Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania—introduced a modest package of reforms that reflected, at least in part, what a majority of Americans wanted to see happen in the wake of the massacre. One of the key elements of that package was the expansion of background checks, which is also a central component of the new proposal. Here’s how a majority of Americans, including gun-owners, felt about strengthening that system in 2013, according to a survey from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research:  The basics: 88.8% of Americans supported universal background checks, including 84.3% of gun owners and 73.7% of registered members of the NRA. A staggering level of consensus. But the bill still failed. Two years later, Johns Hopkins revisited these survey questions to take the national temperature at a moment when the public wasn’t as close to a mass shooting of that scale. (Those moments, however, seem increasingly hard to come by.) Researchers found essentially the same results. The 2015 data revealed that 83.7% of people supported universal background checks, including 84.7% of gun owners. That’s where we are today, with Democrats poised to fight for a package of bills that stand basically no chance of passing despite long-standing public consensus on the issue. On one side, there stands an overwhelming majority of the American public, including the rising number of families who have lost loved ones because our gun laws allow for easy, ready access to deadly weapons. On the other side, there are others, a great many Republicans in Congress, who—in the face of nine deaths in Oregon, two deaths in Virginia, nine deaths in South Carolina—continue to shrug their shoulders and do nothing. So far, “do nothing” has won. Democrats seem ready to do something, even if that something is a symbolic gesture to keep opponents of gun reform from looking the other way as the public tells them they want to live in a less deadly country.

Tonia Moxley of the Roanoke Times reports that Kiung “Eddie” Moon admitted that he posted “…Another 4.16 moment is going to happen tomorrow. Just a warning” on the popular social networking service in April. Moon, 22, was apparently referring to April 16, 2007, the date of the Virginia Tech shooting that left 33 dead and more than a dozen wounded. It was the deadliest lone-gunman mass shooting in U.S. history Moxley writes that Moon blamed the posting “on smoking too much marijuana to calm his nerves before final exams,” and that “his memory of the posting was hazy.” He turned himself in to police after receiving emails about it, Moxley writes. Yik Yak retains the right to share information about posters’ information with law enforcement when necessary. In exchange for a plea agreement, Moon received a suspended sentence and will only serve one month in jail. Last month, a Florida college student was expelled over a Yik Yak post for posting similar language about a threat that the student said had been misinterpreted. Last fall, 11 different students were charged with making threats on Yik Yak. The trend has led to a wave of Yik Yak bans (or attempts at such) on college campuses. In a New York Times piece last year, the app’s founders said they were unprepared for the app to be used in this way, and that they now add filters so that certain keywords, like “Jewish,” or “bomb,” prompt this message: “Pump the brakes, this yak may contain threatening language. Now it’s probably nothing and you’re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this yak cool to post?”  Click to see local listings © 2021 Fusion Media Network, LLC. This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website."

Earlier this year, Texas passed its own “campus carry” law despite opposition from University of Texas Chancellor William McRaven, former leader of the U.S. Special Operations Command who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. (Yeah, he did that.) Texas now joins other states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Oregon (!), which are forcing colleges to allow concealed handguns on campus to varying degrees. In the wake of school shootings like the one in Roseburg, OR, it’s tempting to think that a “good samaritan” with a gun could prevent loss of life, but there’s not exactly a precedent yet for armed civilians stopping a mass shooting. There have been, however, an incomprehensible number of deaths from gunfire. It seems likely that the number of accidents, suicides, and heat-of-the-moment shootings would quickly eclipse the number of lives saved by armed college students. On a lighter note, one thing I miss about college is that glorious moment of finding pizza left over from an event, yours for the taking.

Crime http://fus.in/1KXmsO9 Copied to clipboard Ten people have been killed and at least seven were injured in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., police confirmed to ABC News. A government official confirmed to The Associated Press late Thursday that the shooter was Chris Harper Mercer, 26. Oregon Governor Kate Brown told reporters earlier Thursday that Mercer is deceased. Brown left the press conference to head directly to the Roseburg area. During a Thursday afternoon press conference, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said officers responded to 911 calls from the college at 10:38 a.m. The officers exchanged fire with the suspect and “neutralized” him. Oregon State Police issued a statement saying that there is believed to only be one shooter.  The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office posted to Facebook that students were taken to Douglas County Fairgrounds and can be picked up there.

He also expressed frustration with the continued occurrence of mass shootings in America. “Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium is routine. The conversation in the aftermath. We’ve become numb to this,” he said. Obama also called for stricter laws regulating the sale of guns.

Guns http://fus.in/1WFJSA5 Copied to clipboard What if guns were regulated like abortions? What if there were 48-hour waiting periods, and psychiatric evaluations, and parental consent forms, and only a few places to get one? After Thursday’s mass shooting in Oregon—and the almost immediate realization that it will likely inspire zero gun-control reforms—this two-paragraph hypothetical has gotten thousands of shares on Facebook. Check it out: Thing is, it’s unclear exactly where these words came from. But they appear to be a summary of a 2013 article on Examiner.com by William Hamby called “What if gun laws were like abortion laws?” In it, Hamby argues that Republican legislators have been hypocritical in letting guns go relatively unregulated while piling on “extra-constitutional” obstacles to abortion. “Sounds like someone said it after reading my article,” Hamby wrote on Facebook yesterday, referring to the anonymously authored summary of his article. “Which is exactly why I wrote it.

Guns http://fus.in/1iQWS71 Copied to clipboard Following Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, which left the gunman and nine others dead and more injured, the country met Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin, most notably as he refused to mention the shooter by name so as to not sensationalize him. Two years ago, Hanlin gained some attention for a different reason: In 2013, weeks after the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut, Hanlin was one of hundreds of sheriffs around the country to write the White House and urge them to avoid new gun control legislation. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote at the time. You can read his full letter below:  Last night, President Obama told assembled reporters at the White House that the country needed “common sense” legislation for guns because “our thoughts and prayers are not enough.” Of course, if Congress and elected representatives in state legislatures paid attention to what their constituents wanted, these laws might already be on the books.

              since Army veteran Chris Mintz is being hailed as a hero after protecting fellow students during the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. According to family members, Mintz was shot multiple times while trying to prevent the gunman from gaining access to his classroom. ""He was on the wrestling team and he's done cage-fighting, so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically,"" an aunt told NBC News. Mintz, 30, is recovering from his injuries in the hospital and is expected to survive. Thursday was reportedly his fourth day of classes at the school after serving in the Army for 10 years. A status update was posted to his Facebook account Friday morning which said, “This is Chris's friend, Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts.” Story by Tony Manfred, editing by Stephen Parkhurst Follow INSIDER: On Facebook  "

              since The Institute, founded by investor Sherry Coutu and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, argues that a dearth of talented technologists in the UK and Europe is holding back startups with great potential. Coutu’s organisation, which is backed by Google and the London Stock Exchange, believes that UK startups would have more chance of becoming global giants if they were able to hire talented programmers from wherever they happen to be in the world. At the moment this isn’t always possible due to immigration laws which prevent companies from hiring individuals outside Europe. The number of visas for foreign tech workers hit its maximum cap in June — leaving companies unable to recruit further. “You’re building and growing fast, and it’s taking months and months and months to get that skill set in. We need that to happen faster. That’s the purpose of the scale-up visa.” Business Insider also asked the Scale-Up Institute how close a Scale-Up visa is to becoming reality and is awaiting a response. According to London & Partners, the city's promotional agency, there are 71,000 software developers in the capital, But Silicon Valley is the place that creates more unicorns than any other. It's easier for US companies to get visas for foreign tech workers — the H1-B visa programme last year brought 162,000 tech workers into the US. The UK government currently gives out only 20,700 visas to skilled non-EU professionals annually. But that cap was hit in June, making it impossible for companies like Google UK and Facebook UK to hire people outside Europe during the rest of the year. The UK is home to 17 of the 40 European tech companies that have achieved $1 billion valuations in the last year. Examples include TransferWise, Shazam, and JustEat, according to GP Bullhound. But the Scale-Up Institute believes that the UK now needs to focus on creating companies worth $100 billion. The Institute was launched after Coutu published the Scale-Up Report in 2014. In the report, Coutu argues that the government should focus its efforts on supporting ambitious businesses in scaling to their full potential, providing six recommendations including closing the skills gap, improved access to finance and developing “scale-up leadership."" Government quango Tech City UK is also able to give out 200 visas to exceptionally talented technologists outside the EU but last year a freedom of information request showed that it gave out just seven of them.

              since The gunman, identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, is also dead, according to NBC's Peter Williams. While little was known about the gunman as of early Thursday evening, reports were starting to come in from bystanders who witnessed the attack. One such account is particularly disturbing. Kortney Moore, an 18-year-old student at Umpqua Community College, told Oregon newspaper The News-Review that she was in her Writing 115 class when the attack began. After the shooter shot her teacher in the head from outside the window, he entered the classroom and told people to get on the ground, she said. The shooter then demanded that people stand up and state their religion, Moore told The News-Review. After doing so, he started firing. Moore got on the ground with people who had been shot.

You can read our Privacy Policy here. Meet John Fetterman, mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania. An unconventional candidate in this “all bets are off” year of 2015. He’s in NYC to do Chris Hayes’s show, talk to some local radio hosts, and do some small donor fundraising. (In that MSNBC interview, Hayes begins by noting, “You don’t look like a freak but you stand out in a crowd.”) Fetterman fills my Nation office with his 6’8” tattooed frame—as if his devotion to the town is literally written on his body. In fact, Fetterman shows me his tattoos on one arm of Braddock’s zip codes, on the other the dates marking murders of the town’s citizens during his time as mayor. We meet the very week Fetterman has announced his candidacy for the Senate. 




It will be an uphill fight; in the Democratic primary, Fetterman faces established candidates like former Congressman Joe Sestak and Katie McGinty, a former chief of staff to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf. But in this year of tumult and change, attention must be paid to insurgent candidates, running unconventional races. Here’s a slightly edited version of our conversation, held in The Nation offices on Friday, September 18th.
John Fetterman: I grew up in a conservative small town— York, PA—my family did all right. I grew up privileged. I went to college in Pennsylvania and played football for four years.
I left to go to business school in 1991. I was in my last semester of business school. My best friend was on his way to pick me up to go the gym and he was hit in the head in a car accident. That really rocked my world, because that was my first brush with death at that age. In a search for greater meaning, I joined Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven.
I was paired with a little boy who was 8 at the time whose father had just died of AIDS and his mother would die of AIDS about three or four weeks later. I had never seen anything like that. I had never seen that kind of disparity.
I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven? All of this, of course, eight blocks away from one of the world’s most elite universities.
So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. It will be an uphill fight; in the Democratic primary, Fetterman faces established candidates like former Congressman Joe Sestak and Katie McGinty, a former chief of staff to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf. But in this year of tumult and change, attention must be paid to insurgent candidates, running unconventional races. Here’s a slightly edited version of our conversation, held in The Nation offices on Friday, September 18th.
John Fetterman: I grew up in a conservative small town— York, PA—my family did all right. I grew up privileged. I went to college in Pennsylvania and played football for four years.
I left to go to business school in 1991. I was in my last semester of business school. My best friend was on his way to pick me up to go the gym and he was hit in the head in a car accident. That really rocked my world, because that was my first brush with death at that age. In a search for greater meaning, I joined Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven.
I was paired with a little boy who was 8 at the time whose father had just died of AIDS and his mother would die of AIDS about three or four weeks later. I had never seen anything like that. I had never seen that kind of disparity.
I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven? All of this, of course, eight blocks away from one of the world’s most elite universities.
So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. John Fetterman: I grew up in a conservative small town— York, PA—my family did all right. I grew up privileged. I went to college in Pennsylvania and played football for four years.
I left to go to business school in 1991. I was in my last semester of business school. My best friend was on his way to pick me up to go the gym and he was hit in the head in a car accident. That really rocked my world, because that was my first brush with death at that age. In a search for greater meaning, I joined Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven.
I was paired with a little boy who was 8 at the time whose father had just died of AIDS and his mother would die of AIDS about three or four weeks later. I had never seen anything like that. I had never seen that kind of disparity.
I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven? All of this, of course, eight blocks away from one of the world’s most elite universities.
So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I left to go to business school in 1991. I was in my last semester of business school. My best friend was on his way to pick me up to go the gym and he was hit in the head in a car accident. That really rocked my world, because that was my first brush with death at that age. In a search for greater meaning, I joined Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven.
I was paired with a little boy who was 8 at the time whose father had just died of AIDS and his mother would die of AIDS about three or four weeks later. I had never seen anything like that. I had never seen that kind of disparity.
I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven? All of this, of course, eight blocks away from one of the world’s most elite universities.
So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I was paired with a little boy who was 8 at the time whose father had just died of AIDS and his mother would die of AIDS about three or four weeks later. I had never seen anything like that. I had never seen that kind of disparity.
I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven?

So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.

That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.

And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I became preoccupied with this concept of the random lottery of birth. Why was I born into this incredibly privileged and comfortable existence, and this child, through no fault of his own, was an AIDS orphan by 8 and a half, and was living in an incredibly dangerous section of New Haven? All of this, of course, eight blocks away from one of the world’s most elite universities.
So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals.

You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. So I quit my job and moved to Pittsburgh and I worked in AmeriCorps for two years in the Hill District. And the Hill District is—it’s kind of like—a junior Harlem if you will. It was a really important cultural center for African-Americans and a lot of jazz clubs. It was really a storied neighborhood. But even today—there’s incredible disparity.
I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that.

They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern.

People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in.

There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I set up some of the first computer labs in the district and taught GED classes, typing, and Microsoft Office to mothers and fathers. Then, at that point, I went back to graduate school to get a public-policy degree. That’s when I went to Harvard—to really kind of fuse public policy, social work, and business together—something to confront this disparity—this inequality.
When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil.

It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life.

The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. When I finished up at the Kennedy School I was offered the chance to start a GED program in a town called Braddock, Pennsylvania. Braddock is an incredibly storied and historic place. It’s where George Washington received his first combat experience in 1755. Then 120 years later Andrew Carnegie would change the world by opening his first steel mill that perfected the Bessemer process, which allowed steel to become super-strong and rigid—which gave rise to the buildings that many of us sit in and bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the Silicon Valley of its day. No exaggeration. So it’s an incredibly unique community in the sense of its role in shaping so much of American history.
I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I started working there for four years, running this program, and really enjoying it. But I started bumping up against the limit of what I wanted to do. I decided at that point to run for mayor, and I started that campaign with the help of my students. They were—I’ve learned the term now—they were my “validators.” They would go out, and we’d knock on doors, and people would say, “Wow, no one has ever knocked on our doors before elections before.” One of the things that struck me at the time was that if I didn’t know me, I wouldn’t open the doors for them [Laughs].
I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.
Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I hadn’t even been living in town that long. People were just really interested. Long story short: I won that first election by one vote.

Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Katrina vanden Heuvel: Tell me more about Braddock—where is it heading, what’s its trajectory?
The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that.

They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak.

People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. The trajectory—well, it was one of the most important centers for commerce in western Pennsylvania. But since the middle of the last century, it lost close to 90 percent of its population. Socioeconomically—after Hurricane Katrina—I compared it to the Ninth Ward. It’s very similar.
So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.

It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.

Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. So hit hard in the last 40 years?
Yeah, torn apart. Globalization. Suburbanization. Deindustrialization. And, I won that election by one vote. That one vote was a provisional ballot that somebody cast even after being told they weren’t allowed to vote. Nearly 40 percent of its people live below the poverty line.
I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights.

Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I carried the flag of the young people. I took off in early 2006, and it’s been a great 10-year run of working in statistically one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?

If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Was it a Democratic constituency?
Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.

I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Yes, it’s overwhelmingly African-American—probably about 80 percent African-American—the white segment of the population is traditionally people who have lived there their whole lives.
Families for generations—they’ve seen Braddock when it had the density of Brooklyn.
And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage.

People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. And now it’s been hollowed out.
It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. It’s a steel town. In fact, I lived directly across the street from the last functioning steel mill in Pittsburgh. I joke, it would be like the last brewery in Milwaukee. It’s something that defined that half of the state and defined Pittsburgh. That’s really the last vestige of steel production in the Pittsburgh area.
You’ve been mayor since 2006?
Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.

I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.

What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Yes, January 2006.
For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.

The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. For the last decade, it’s been a time of tumult and change—
Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.

Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Yeah, absolutely. And the different issues that we’ve confronted in Braddock on a small scale are the different issues that we’re dealing with on a national scale. Just like when I bumped up against limits the last time—wanting to have a bigger platform for the issues that I care about, that’s really my justification for running this time around.
It might sound schmaltzy, but I have the best job in the world. I love being mayor and everything that goes along with that. I’m carrying that same flag and these same issues that I was in 2005, looking to expand the “bully pulpit,” for a lack of a better phrase, that my office had afforded and that this office has to offer.
What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.

Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. What have been the key issues and principles of your work as mayor?
There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak.

We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. There’s been so many: economic inequality, trying to attract and bring in new business, public safety—Braddock was perceived as one of the two areas in the Pittsburgh areas that you really avoided—we enjoyed a lot of success with bringing crime down, we went five and a half years without a loss of life in our community, but we did it without getting any police complaints or anything like that. I tell people I’m pro-police but I’m also very pro–Black Lives Matter. They can’t be mutually exclusive. I could introduce you to police officers that if you could bottle what they have, we would have never had a Ferguson and some of these other situations. Even air quality: In the Monongahela Valley, which Braddock is a part, just six or seven miles down is literally the most toxic air in America. It’s a known carcinogen—that’s the Environmental Protection Agency saying that—not just my opinion.
Just inequality at every different level: housing, air, education, public safety, income, and healthcare. You probably wouldn’t have heard of it in New York. There’s an enormous nonprofit, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and they are a behemoth. I think they’re a $11 billion, $12 billion nonprofit that runs hospitals. One of the last crown jewels of Braddock was that we had one of the best hospitals. In 2009 they called me up and said “we’re gone, we’re outta here.” They made plans to build a beautiful $300 million—
They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.

Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. They took to a town that’s much wealthier… whiter. It sparked this incredible struggle with this massive multibillion-dollar nonprofit that’s supposed to care. Obviously, you’re not going to make money providing healthcare to a poor community. But you have that responsibility. Why wouldn’t you want to take that on? So finally we were able to work with another nonprofit, Highmark. Now we have the finest urgent-care center in the state in our community.
You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?

We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. You were at the front lines of negotiating and bringing that about?
Exactly. UPMC told me to get bent. They were just like, “I’m not having it. Sorry.” Again, this is a rounding error for them. I mean look, I understand if the hospital days are gone, put in an urgent care center. That saves people’s lives. They just weren’t having it. I don’t understand. Their CEO Jeffery Romoff earns $6 million. I was like how many yachts can you water-ski behind? Why can’t you just put in an urgent-care center? They wouldn’t. But we were able to partner with another large nonprofit [Highmark], and it’s literally saved lives. Where people come up saying, “I don’t feel very well,” they hook them up and they call them an ambulance right away.
Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary. 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life.

Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote.

I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Even things I never had to worry about growing up, like getting people’s gas turned back on, electricity, water, turned back on. The level of disparity that I think many Americans don’t realize truly exists. I was one of them before I had my experience. So my time as mayor has really run the gamut in terms of the issues that we’ve tackled.
I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t.

That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I am also a success story for the Affordable Care Act. As a small-town mayor, my wife and I didn’t have health insurance, after it was passed, we bought our policies on the exchange. About six months later, my wife took a step wrong and she shattered a bone in her foot. That would have wiped us out. Financially. We probably wouldn’t even have gotten the care, the surgery, the rehabilitation, I’m just so grateful for those kinds of changes. I remark that we’re the one percent, but truly the bottom 1 percent.
We write a lot about the need for clear air, tacking climate crisis. But as mayor of Braddock and a possibly future senator from Pennsylvania how do you reconcile clear air and water,the urgency of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring your people have jobs?
Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on.

In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Let me share an anecdote. In 2009, I was selected by the Environmental Defense Fund to be the face of the carbon caps. To really push to pass carbon caps. The slogan was: “carbon caps equal hard hats.” We did a series of videos where I insisted that the people in the videos—we partnered with the Blue Green Alliance, which are people in the steel mills, and the environmental Sierra Club—we featured all steel workers that had been laid off and our tag line was that there are 187 moving parts in a windmill that are made of steel. I could literally see the light bulbs go on in these guys, because they weren’t like tree-hugger Subaru-driving kind of guys. I said look a windmill and they were like “Yeah! Yeah.” By the end of the campaign they were like “I ain’t no goddamn tree-hugger, but I get this now. I really do.” I helped translate that for people that are naturally turned off by the term “environmentalist” or whatever.
Fracking is a huge issue in PA. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Josh Fox. I’ve seen Gas Land multiple times. The reality is that fracking is here to stay in southwestern PA. My issue with it is two-fold: Why wouldn’t Pennsylvania want to have the strictest and best environmental standards? I grew up with pictures of things like love canal and things like that. Why not have the best environmental regulations? And also tax, if a family buys a pizza on a Saturday night, they pay tax on it. Yet these companies aren’t paying any taxes on extracting our natural resources. To me, with fracking as entrenched as it is, those are my two main inflexible points. Look we need to tax and we have to have three times the most stringent environmental regulations than we have today. It’s so pervasive, we run the risk of contaminating our ground water.
People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?

There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. People, they get it. There is a tide. Listen, our air is never going to be as clean as Portland, Oregon. There is always going to be that trade-off. People understand, when you put it in better terms, that this is very important. Everyone I know believes in climate change. It’s something that we as a country have to address. I think that we have to bring it over in a way that (and put it in terms)—like the steel workers for example—they like their pick-up trucks and are put off by what they perceive as pretentious environmentalists—and put it in terms that they understand it.There’s also a segment of people that ridicule solar energy. They say things like, “Oh, that can’t even power this.” But again, that’s like making fun of the microprocessor in 1983. You know it’s like—
“It’s coming!”
Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society.

I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Yeah, like “it’s coming.” Why not invest in these things? You have no idea how it could transform society someday.
I don’t need to tell you this, but we’re in a time when conventional status quo politics isn’t cutting it and people are rejecting the status quo. Do you see your campaign as an insurgent one?
I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half.

I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I don’t see it as an insurgency. I see it as: “This who I am.” I can’t sugarcoat what happened to my community. I dress the way I dress, I speak the way I speak. I’m not focus-grouped, I’m not poll-tested, or anything like that. I see it as, we have a story and it will either resonate or it won’t. The bottom line, for me anyways, is if every person in my campaign and everyone that I can think of, makes middle-class families the center for why they are doing it and their concern. We have 14 years of working at the most grassroots of levels dealing with these issues. People in our state are going to have to decide, wherever you live, who has the best understanding of the issues that are facing me every day and the community that I live in. That’s the first thing that’s going to win the primary.

How do you see your road to victory?
I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half.

There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I see the path as getting out there and sharing the story. There are things that I can leverage. People don’t expect a 6’8,9 guy with tattoos to be running for the US Senate. I get some attention there that I wouldn’t have if I was a more conventional candidate. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I genuinely believe my chances of winning here are better than when I ran for mayor of Braddock and won in 2005, because the odds there—I lived there for a year and a half. I’m white in a majority African-American community. There were a lot of differences and barriers, but at the end of the day people just wanted change. People wanted to see things get better.
I don’t even consider myself a politician in that sense. My office is more social justice if anything. It’s a platform to exercise my belief in social justice.
You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.

Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. You see that best achieved through electoral politics?
I do.
What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.

I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. What are some key issues you’re focused on?
I’m pro legalizing marijuana, but I go even further than some of my colleagues because I’m for decriminalizing across the board. I see it as a public-health issue, not a criminal issue. I’ve seen first hand for the last 14 years the effects it has on families, I’ve seen people overdosing—
Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned.

All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Is there a meth crisis in the state?
Heroin has claimed, as far as I know, at least 36 lives this year in overdoses. I’ve seen three people who’ve overdosed get the shard of the narc in their arms and it’s jarring. There was a huge car accident in front of our home earlier this summer. They shot up in a parking lot and crashed. It hasn’t worked. This isn’t me. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact.
The War on Drugs?
The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.

There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth.

She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. The War on Drugs, yes, the War on Drugs. If we start treating it as a public-health issue, with more compassion, without the criminal element, I think it’ll be a lot better for this society and a lot of these other issues like violence and public safety are also going to improve as a result, and we’ll also be taking a big step in taking down the prison-industrial complex.
There are a lot of different entry points that the War on Drugs has. Whether you’re using, whether you commit crimes to keep your self using, whether you’re defending your turf with violence. There’s just so many wires it’s like the Gordian knot there. Once it’s cut, I think you’re going to find that it’ll transform society. So many of the issues that we have in our community are tied to that. I know it hasn’t worked. I’ve seen it for 14 years. I don’t know if it’s an unpopular view or a popular view, but it’s the truth. That’s what I’m going to say and that’ll consistently be my message.
I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant.

A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?

That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities.

No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair.

The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I know you don’t consider yourself a politician, but are there people on the scene who you find are doing some of the work that you believe in? Other senators or mayors?
Well, I’m a huge fan of our president. I was the only mayor in western PA to be all in for the president. I was one of the two or three that were advisers during “Bittergate.” Do you remember people in small towns clinging to guns and religion?
The anger that triggered was crazy. I was in the first electoral college for Barack Obama in Pennsylvania. I’ve always been—I was a surrogate in western PA in 2012. Because I’ve seen the job that he’s done and I hold him in incredibly high regard.
Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself.

It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. Just talking Bittergate. On guns. Bernie Sanders has come under some fire for his position, but my sense is that these are regional issues—
Yeah, it is very different. I own guns. As a teenager we’d go deer hunting. As far as gun legislation and control goes, on my arm there are dates when people of my community have been killed. Seven of those 9 dates are gun related. If there is ever a piece of legislation that would have prevented those, that would have been what I immediately advocate that we sign into law. When you see the effects of that up close and personal. What upsets me about gun control, I don’t see it as science based. Instead of just trying to explore political points, we need an evidence/sciences based policy. Instead of this reactionary politics where people say, “Hey, we’ve had a mass-shooting, now let’s talk about this.” It should be a bipartisan issue as well. Nobody wants—I don’t mean to be graphic—but until you see someone with their brains blown out you don’t get the urgency of it and the appropriateness of it. And how important it is to get it right, because you’re probably only going to get one bite of that apple.
If you go to the senate, there are issues that you may or may not have had the chance to grapple with, like the Iran deal, issues of war and peace.
A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.

The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. A couple thoughts on that. We’ve had 13 or 14 years of “I’m here to chew bubblegum and kick ass—and I’m all out of bubblegum.” How has that worked out for us? It really hasn’t. The Dean of the Kennedy School when I was there was a man named Joseph Nye. His big thing was “soft power.” I think America never fully exercised its soft power like it should have. I also had the privilege of meeting Robert McNamara when I was there. He was on his tour of “the argument without end.” This whole idea that the Vietnam War could have been prevented if we had known what was really going on and what they were thinking. I’m haunted by that concept.
Think of all the issues that we as a country are locked up in. This important legacy that I think has been lost in this cacophony of “let’s go blow more stuff up” is that it may not have to be that way. What a great tragedy it would be if it could be avoided if you understand the situation on the ground, if you actually talk to people before you push the button.
In these last weeks, we’ve heard hate and vitriol about immigrants. How do you think about America’s history with immigration?
I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years.

Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.

It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.

The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. I wouldn’t have a family if it wasn’t for immigration. My wife was born in Brazil, and her family fled a very dangerous and violent situation in Brazil. She came to this country at 9 and lived for many years undocumented. Her mother cleaned homes and they scraped by any way they could. They never took public assistance or anything like that. It’s a part of the American success story. Yet, you have half the body politic talking about the 14th Amendment and anchor babies, and “they’re murderers and rapists” and such. It’s outrageous. We need a compassionate response to immigration reform.
Is this something you deal with as a mayor?
We don’t have immigration issues in Braddock proper, but my wife and her family, and all the people they knew growing up. These are just people that wanted something better for themselves and that comes back to refugees as well. Everyone has seen that heart-breaking picture of that man carrying that boy that drowned. My son’s that age. How hard is your heart that if you could see an image like that and still say that we can’t do anything to help these refugees. The fierce rhetoric coming from the right, the harshness, the hard heartedness of it—it goes against basic decency. I’m proud of the way that immigration has touched my life. I would never shy away from that and I don’t care what the politics of it say. If that matters to you and you choose not to vote for me, I don’t want your vote. If you think that it’s okay that a 6-year-old boy drowns in the ocean and you don’t want to do anything about it, I don’t want your vote.
Who are your “validators” in this campaign?
My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.

Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. My validators are the people that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. We had a spectacular launch event. I live in an old car dealership across the street from the Edgar Thompson steel plant. We had our launch event on the roof where they use to park cars in the 20s and 30s. We had all these people, I joked to my wife that it’s a wonderful life. Where everybody shows up and they say, “You did this or you did that.” Honestly, I was just blown away, because I hadn’t seen some of these people in years. The best part of it for me is that those original people that voted for me and made the difference in 2005, came out ten years later to be like, “You got this! We’re behind you 150 percent.” I have the same validators as I did back in 2005.
A technocratic question, forgive me— what’s your name recognition?
Honestly, I don’t know. But anecdotally, on the turnpike when we stop to get gas in PA, seven people stopped me and said, “Can I take a selfie?” or “You go!” or “I gotchu”—
That’s because you’re on social media?
Yeah, honestly, it’s also my appearance. I look like an old washed-up professional wrestler. Without a doubt, if there is an upside to looking like me, it’s that people will recognize me in public sooner than they would a traditional candidate.
All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair.

All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.
It’s a moment when people want someone who is comfortable in his or her own skin. To be authentic.
Here’s my take on this —if that’s not compatible with you then I’m not going to take your vote. I’ve been hearing from Republicans, “I’m a life-long Republican, but I just respect what you do,” because in Pennsylvania either you live in a community that people feel like their best days are behind them, you use to live in a community like that and moved, or you have your parents or other relatives that live in these kinds of communities. I feel like those are my people. That’s who I really represent.
It also seems like this is a moment when people feel displaced, and in such times people have a sense of hope or one of fear. My sense is you’re speaking to the hope.
I described it when I took office—it’s a line I stole from a movie—“it’s time to either get busy living or get busy dying.” People understand that. I wouldn’t blame anybody if they gave up. Particularly in a community that has suffered as much as Braddock. But the lesson for me from Braddock is that no community deserves to be abandoned. No one deserves to be left by the side of the road. For example, I have two graduate degrees and zero student load debt and that’s not fair. Where as a kid in my community didn’t even graduate from high school. That’s un-American and it’s not sustainable. For me to be walking around with two graduate degrees and so many other people don’t even get the chance to attend community college. It’s not like if we expand community colleges they’re going to kick in my door and come steal my diplomas. It’s this weird mentality that runs in circles where it’s like, “You’re taking from me in order to make more opportunities for others.” It’s that same false choice where people think they have to choose between the environment and jobs. That’s not true either.
People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. All I have is this story. All I have is what I am and what I believe in. I would never not be who I am.

The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane. It shouldn’t be a political issue, it should be a common-sense issue. I remember what it was like to be hormonal when I was 17. Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. People get it but then they’re often manipulated—
Absolutely, you call it the low-information voters. To me that is the single biggest problem in American politics other than money. People have conflated rhetoric and politics with governance. When you lose the ability to fashion laws and remember that it’s about governance. They’re making fun of people’s appearances now in debates. I’m like, what’s next? The head to the turnbuckle or the rake to the eyes?
Let them make fun of you.
Yeah, well.
Will there be debates?
I would hope so… but it hasn’t been decided yet.
In terms of money in politics, are you doing a small donor campaign?
Yeah, we just launched on Monday. So we’re just fresh into that hunt. It’s a sad commentary, but money is important. Politics should be a competition of ideas and stories. But money is a sad reality. We’re going after small donors, because there’s not a lot of $2,700 checks in my line of work. I can’t do anything for these people except help get them some clothes or get their gas turned back on. It’s not like I can just make a few phone calls and get these big donors. But we get a lot of support coming in online on social media and taking advantage of our story.
You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.

Why can’t we just have these conversations about sex ed and have everybody realize that this is a grown-up thing with grown-up consequences and you need to take the appropriate steps?
I don’t want to be senator if I don’t espouse positions that are not my authentic own.
I have a wonderful job already. I have a great family. I’m never moving out of Braddock, so I can’t lose. If people in Pennsylvania want to give me that bigger platform, so to speak, then I’m going to do everything that I promised I’m going to do. You’re going to do some media here today?
I think we’re going to do Chris Hayes today.
Chris Hayes, right. He was our great Washington editor, you know.
Oh, I know.
He was sinfully young. We miss him.
Well, let me just end by repeating what I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: You cannot sugarcoat what happened to my community any more than you can sugarcoat myself. The story that I have is the story that I have. It’s not going to change in response to polls or opinion. It is what it is. The last thing—and also gay rights. I was the only official in Pennsylvania. I did the first same-sex wedding before it was “technically” legal. There was a registrar in Montgomery county that started issuing marriage licenses. It’s absurd that you could oppose two people that love each other from—the amount of grief and relief that came over them when I solemnized those first weddings. Couple’s been together for 29 years. They had to live through this maze of legal agreements so they can see their spouse if they get sick. All of this ridiculousness. I told this story to a reporter where people were like, “You’re going to get in trouble.” Tom Corbett, the governor at the time, took a shot. I said, “Look, if you wanna come send the gay police out, that’s fine. But I’m not going to stop doing this.” I cringe when I say the term same-sex marriage, because the term should just be marriage. How that takes away from your marriage to allow two people of the same-sex to love each other and build a life together, it’s truly perverse. I was quite frankly disappointed in my other elected officials who didn’t want to touch that. Even the mayor of New Hope wouldn’t do it. They wouldn’t touch it. Gutless. It’s disappointing.
If I see something wrong, I’m going to do something about it.
Another one of the great mysteries of mine is why can’t we all agree on birth control? Why is there a segment of our society that opposes abortion and also opposes birth control? We have to be real about it. Either we can deal with it as adults or pretend like a purity ring is going to change it. Why you would want to take away women’s access to that and healthcare? All the other important things that occur there. And shut the government down. It gets back to rhetoric and politics instead of actual governance. To create more of what you decry is insane.

But in his increasingly vicious response to the Roseburg, Oregon, shooting, he’s sounded neither soft-spoken nor Christian at all. 




Carson, who attacked President Obama for “politicizing” the shooting at Umpqua Community College, said he changed his mind about the merits of an assault-weapons ban because he read about “tyranny.” He has also called for the arming of kindergarten teachers to prevent child massacres like the 2012 Sandy Hook killings. But he may have gone too far when he criticized victims of the Oregon mass shooting for not fighting back against their killer.
“Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me, I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all,’” he told Fox News. 

Carson’s attack on Roseburg victims sounded like Donald Trump’s attack on Sen. John McCain for being captured.



It sounded a lot like Donald Trump’s attack on Senator John McCain for being captured and held a POW during the Vietnam war. “I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said in June. Carson seemed to be saying, “I like people who weren’t gunned down in a classroom.”
Still, for most of this campaign, Carson had seemed like the anti-Trump, despite his hard-right views. He delivers his jibes, when he slings them, in a mild voice, almost thoughtfully. Where Trump shouts, Carson indeed speaks softly. And as Trump has moved beyond dog-whistling to using a megaphone when it comes to issues of race, crime and immigration, Carson in his very person seems to defend the GOP from charges of stoking racial polarization for political gain.
The top rival to the man who called undocumented Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals,” and who defends police excess as an appropriate response to rising crime, is an African-American neurosurgeon who became an icon to African-Americans, then built his political fame on the white Christian book-and-conference circuit. How can the GOP be castigated as the party of white people (in fact, nine of 10 2012 Republican voters were white) when one of its top two contenders is black? 
THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. 

DONATE NOW!



But the modern GOP has always been happy to showcase a few prominent black conservatives. It used to be former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who recently admitted he stays in the increasingly right-wing party “because it annoys them.”
And Carson has supplied conservative whites with validation for their blinkered ideas about black people: that disproportionate African-American poverty is simply a matter of not working hard enough, combined with Democrats’ giving them what Jeb Bush inelegantly labeled “free stuff.” Of course Carson’s stance is just as ironic as the scion of wealth and power Bush’s preaching about “earned opportunity.” The man who grew up on welfare now crusades against it, telling the hosts of The View last year:
When you rob someone of their incentive to go out there and improve themselves, you are not doing them any favors. When you take somebody and pat them on the head and say, ‘There, there, you poor little thing… Let me give you housing subsidies, let me give you free health care because you can’t do that.’ What would be much more empowering is to use our intellect and our resources to give those people a way up and out.
I shouldn’t be surprised that Carson is sharpening his edge as he rises in the polls. He made his political name with a nasty rebuke to President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast. He then called Obamacare the “worst thing to have happened in this nation since slavery” and compared Obama to a “psychopath.” His bigoted remarks about Muslims rival Trump’s blather about Mexicans. The New York Times observed that “since starting his campaign, Mr. Carson had begun to soften his tone in hopes of appealing to a broader swath of voters,” but recently “he has veered back into more controversial territory.” Indeed.
There was at least one decent thing about Carson, politically: He once supported the assault-weapons ban. But he couldn’t maintain that position if he wanted to make a serious run at the GOP nomination. So he’s reversed himself. On guns, he’s a neurosurgeon who seems like he’s performed his own lobotomy. 

On guns, Carson seems like a neurosurgeon who performed his own lobotomy.


Generally, though, his policies are to the right of Trump’s. And on Wednesday the GOP front-runner reached out and gave some support to the number-two candidate, after Carson’s comments about the Roseburg victims triggered a backlash. Trump tweeted: “Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!”
It’s hard to know whether his awful Roseburg comments will hurt Carson. Improbably, a Quinnipiac poll out Wednesday morning shows him beating Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden in the key states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Personally, I think that’s ridiculous: Once voters are paying attention, and look beyond his soothing mien to his truly radical politics, Carson won’t stand a chance against a Democrat.
As far as the GOP primary race, there’s no reason to think his cruel comments about gun victims will hurt him. Perhaps Carson has given up on being the anti-Trump, since the unlikely front-runner has shown that the base has a limitless appetite for crude and cruel remarks. But the media, at least, seem to be waking up to the fact that the man it routinely terms “soft-spoken” and Christian is actually a far-right loon. That’s a kind of progress in a political world where reporters and pundits can’t seem to take in the scary rightward drift of the GOP. Carson, who attacked President Obama for “politicizing” the shooting at Umpqua Community College, said he changed his mind about the merits of an assault-weapons ban because he read about “tyranny.” He has also called for the arming of kindergarten teachers to prevent child massacres like the 2012 Sandy Hook killings.

Perhaps Carson has given up on being the anti-Trump, since the unlikely front-runner has shown that the base has a limitless appetite for crude and cruel remarks. But the media, at least, seem to be waking up to the fact that the man it routinely terms “soft-spoken” and Christian is actually a far-right loon. That’s a kind of progress in a political world where reporters and pundits can’t seem to take in the scary rightward drift of the GOP. “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me, I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all,’” he told Fox News. 

Carson’s attack on Roseburg victims sounded like Donald Trump’s attack on Sen. John McCain for being captured.



It sounded a lot like Donald Trump’s attack on Senator John McCain for being captured and held a POW during the Vietnam war. “I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said in June. Carson seemed to be saying, “I like people who weren’t gunned down in a classroom.”
Still, for most of this campaign, Carson had seemed like the anti-Trump, despite his hard-right views. He delivers his jibes, when he slings them, in a mild voice, almost thoughtfully. Where Trump shouts, Carson indeed speaks softly. And as Trump has moved beyond dog-whistling to using a megaphone when it comes to issues of race, crime and immigration, Carson in his very person seems to defend the GOP from charges of stoking racial polarization for political gain.
The top rival to the man who called undocumented Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals,” and who defends police excess as an appropriate response to rising crime, is an African-American neurosurgeon who became an icon to African-Americans, then built his political fame on the white Christian book-and-conference circuit. How can the GOP be castigated as the party of white people (in fact, nine of 10 2012 Republican voters were white) when one of its top two contenders is black?

But the modern GOP has always been happy to showcase a few prominent black conservatives. It used to be former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who recently admitted he stays in the increasingly right-wing party “because it annoys them.”
And Carson has supplied conservative whites with validation for their blinkered ideas about black people: that disproportionate African-American poverty is simply a matter of not working hard enough, combined with Democrats’ giving them what Jeb Bush inelegantly labeled “free stuff.” Of course Carson’s stance is just as ironic as the scion of wealth and power Bush’s preaching about “earned opportunity.” The man who grew up on welfare now crusades against it, telling the hosts of The View last year:
When you rob someone of their incentive to go out there and improve themselves, you are not doing them any favors. When you take somebody and pat them on the head and say, ‘There, there, you poor little thing… Let me give you housing subsidies, let me give you free health care because you can’t do that.’ What would be much more empowering is to use our intellect and our resources to give those people a way up and out.
I shouldn’t be surprised that Carson is sharpening his edge as he rises in the polls. He made his political name with a nasty rebuke to President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast. He then called Obamacare the “worst thing to have happened in this nation since slavery” and compared Obama to a “psychopath.” His bigoted remarks about Muslims rival Trump’s blather about Mexicans. The New York Times observed that “since starting his campaign, Mr. Carson had begun to soften his tone in hopes of appealing to a broader swath of voters,” but recently “he has veered back into more controversial territory.” Indeed.
There was at least one decent thing about Carson, politically: He once supported the assault-weapons ban. But he couldn’t maintain that position if he wanted to make a serious run at the GOP nomination. So he’s reversed himself. On guns, he’s a neurosurgeon who seems like he’s performed his own lobotomy.

Generally, though, his policies are to the right of Trump’s. And on Wednesday the GOP front-runner reached out and gave some support to the number-two candidate, after Carson’s comments about the Roseburg victims triggered a backlash. Trump tweeted: “Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!”
It’s hard to know whether his awful Roseburg comments will hurt Carson. Improbably, a Quinnipiac poll out Wednesday morning shows him beating Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden in the key states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Personally, I think that’s ridiculous: Once voters are paying attention, and look beyond his soothing mien to his truly radical politics, Carson won’t stand a chance against a Democrat.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/guns_are_cuddly_security_blankets_how_the_media_helps_right_wing_gun_nuts_push_propaganda/,"Conservative politicians and pundits lie and distort far more than liberals do. At the same time, conservatives have a well-known persecution complex, frequently accusing the mainstream media of having some secret anti-conservative agenda. This puts mainstream media fact-checkers in an unenviable situation, trying to seem balanced in an environment where one side simply has more enthusiasm for lying than the other. Now the pressure to overemphasis or even exaggerate claims of liberal mendacity, in an attempt to seem more balanced, has infected Glenn Kessler's coverage of the gun debate in the Washington Post. Our tale begins with a speech by President Obama where he said, ""We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don’t work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence."" This is, as Kessler's investigation demonstrated, a true statement. The statistics are complicated by demographic and social factors, but overall, the data shows a direct correlation between how easy it is to get a gun and how many people die from gunshot wounds. But Kessler gave Obama two ""Pinocchios""---out of of four Pinocchio scale---to this claim. ""Many readers requested a fact check of this statement, believing it to be untrue,"" Kessler writes. I'll bet they did! Conservative fetishization of guns is at a point where even suggesting that guns might be unsafe is treated like you're insulting their mother, so of course they're going to be outraged that Obama dare suggest that objects created for the sole purpose of killing might be very good at making people dead. It's understandable that, deluged by all that conservative outrage, one might give into the urge to show that you're not biased by giving them what they want. But unfortunately, Kessler, despite being a fact-checker, ends up heavily massaging the statistics to give conservative readers those Pinocchios they desperately want. To get to the conclusion that Obama fudged the facts, Kessler starts by manipulating the data that Obama used for his claim, by removing suicides from the number of overall gun deaths. He justifies this by arguing ""the president’s policy proposals are aimed at mass shootings, not suicides."" But that is, in and of itself, a false statement. While Obama did focus heavily on mass shooting in his speech, it's clear that he was making a larger point about how the proliferation of guns in our society leads to more gun deaths. ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" Obama said right before the sentences in question. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?"" It's clear that he was speaking about how a gun-fanatical society is one where people get shot to death a lot, and not just in the context of mass shootings. In addition, while the president's proposed policy agenda on gun violence focuses heavily on preventing murder, many of the policies are about preventing gun deaths generally, including those from suicide. The White House policy proposal for reducing gun violence repeatedly mentions suicide. Many of the agenda items, including more funding for research and better mental health services, would have suicide prevention benefits as well as murder prevention benefits. There's no reason to exclude suicides from the gun death count, except to pander to opponents of gun control. For one thing, suicides are just as dead as people who are murdered. Suicide has major effects on families and communities. Plus, the gun suicide and gun murder rate are heavily intertwined. Laws aimed at reducing gun murders appear to lower the suicide rate. It's a myth that suicidal people will kill themselves no matter what. Most people who attempt it and survive don't try again. Easy access to guns makes suicide more likely because it means you're more likely to die than people who try through other, less deadly means. But what makes Kessler's article particularly frustrating is that all this quibbling over a couple of outlier states that defy the trend or whether or not suicides ""count"" ends up serving not the truth, but the Big Lie about guns: That they are not only safe, but that they somehow make people safer. Conservatives want to distract from the larger fact that soaking a society in guns means people are going to use them more, whether on themselves or on other people. So they claim, instead, that guns actually induce safety and if people keep getting shot, it's because they don't have enough items with which to shoot people with. The Big Lie is everywhere in the wake of this most recent shooting in Oregon. This week, Ben Carson argued that putting guns inside kindergarten classrooms is the best way to protect small children from guns. ""Gun-free zones"" are being blamed for the shooting all over conservative media. The message from the right is clear: Far from being deadly weapons, guns are cuddly security blankets! The Big Lie is what Obama was calling out in his speech. Conservatives keep pushing this notion that guns keep you safe, and Obama was, well, fact-checking them. Kessler should be applauding him for that instead of pandering to conservatives who want to deflect attention from the larger argument about  the irrational enthusiasm some Americans have for arming themselves like they're the about to face the zombie apocalypse. All of which is why two eyebrows should be raised at the eagerness for conservatives to exclude suicides from the gun death rate. Of course they do, because, in a lot of ways, suicides prove exactly how dangerous it is to cultivate a gun-nut society. Take, for instance, the debate over gun-free zones on campus. Conservatives like to argue that allowing guns on campus will keep students safer, on the grounds that there might be someone around to stop a mass shooter in his tracks. Even if that were true---and there's no reason to think it is---it doesn't actually follow that stuffing college campuses, which are full of young people and alcohol, with guns is a great idea. Most gun deaths are, after all, the result of accidents, suicides, or interpersonal crime, not mass murder.  Suicide rates for college-aged men are particularly high, in part because they have so much access to guns. Giving them more is not going to help. Look, conservatives are going to deflect, quibble, and use ""liberal media"" accusations to try to distort coverage of major issues like gun control. It's understandable to feel temptation to throw them a bone, even if you have to massage the facts, in hopes that they will shut up. But fact-checking ceases to be fact-checking when it's in service of distorting the truth instead of illuminating it.

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/trump_on_oregon_shooting_youre_going_to_have_these.html#incart_2box_politics_index.ssf,"TRENTON -- A day after a shooter killed nine people and wounded nine others at a community college in Oregon, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said Friday that no matter how strong the U.S. makes it gun laws, ""you're going to have these things happen."" Trump's comments came less than 24 hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday -- an incident that prompted President Obama to give an impassioned speech calling once again for tighter gun control legislation. Appearing via phone on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Trump offered a different perspective when asked what he'd do to prevent mass shootings if he were elected to the White House. The billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino magnate said the country already has ""very strong laws on the books."" ""But you're always going to have problems,"" said Trump, who is leading his 14 rivals for the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- in the polls. ""We have millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world. And it does happen all over the world."" MORE: N.J.'s House Democrats: Protect Americans from gun violence Trump -- who released a policy paper last month calling for the expansion of rights for legal gun owners -- noted that school shootings are ""unique to this country."" And he blamed mental illness for the issue. In his paper, Trump advocates for better programs to treat mental illness, though he doesn't specify how. ""It is a terrible situation,"" the real estate mogul and former reality television host told MSNBC on Friday. ""It's huge mental illness. You're going to have these things happen. And it's a horrible thing to behold."" Host Willie Geist asked Trump is it's ""fair to say"" his opinion is that ""some people are going to slip through the cracks, and there's nothing you can do about it."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty, it would be, for the next million years,"" Trump replied. ""People are going to slip through the cracks. Even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks."" Trump noted that many shooters in mass killings are ""loners"" and ""have all sorts of difficulties."" ""There are many people like that,"" he said. ""What are you gonna do, institutionalize everybody?"" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is shown on the campaign trail. Trump was one of a few Republican presidential candidates Friday who said that despite yet another mass shooting, tougher gun laws are not the answer. Speaking in Iowa, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said ""you're not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal law-abiding citizens. ""It doesn't work for crazies,"" Carson said. Speaking in South Carolina -- the site of the Charleston church shooting this summer -- former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said ""before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have."" Fiorina -- who was an executive at Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill before her time at HP -- also said President Obama's remarks after the shooting were ""premature at best and at worst a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy."" Obama made his comments hours after the shooting Thursday. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" the Democratic president told reporters during  a news conference at the White House. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' Well, this is something we should politicize,"" he added. It was the 11th time during Obama's seven years as president that he delivered a speech in the wake of a mass shooting in America. A 2014 report by the FBI found that even though homicides have dropped overall in the U.S., mass shootings have risen drastically over the last seven years. And research by Harvard University scholars shows that a mass shooting has occurred every 64 days on average in America since 2011. Christie, who was in Cape May County preparing for the possibility of Hurricane Joaquin hitting New Jersey, did not issue a statement Friday about the shooting.

Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters that the 20-year-old college student was “neutralized.” The suspect, who was not named, also appears to have had a conversation online about the attack last night. According to CNN: The suspect was a 20-year-old man, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. Investigators are examining social media postings they believe were made by the suspect, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation.  “We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler told CNN. He said that two patients died while being transported to a hospital. The shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, the source told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms. This is a developing story. ————– UPDATED: Thursday, October 1, 2015 3:00 PM EST The shooter has been taken into custody, a Douglas County commissioner confirmed to CNN. The number of deceased has been decreased to seven to 10, Oregon State Police Lt.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/08/fox_news_sick_capitulation_to_mass_murderers_making_gun_violence_the_new_normal/,"Sometime between the Sandy Hook massacre and the most recent mass shooting in Oregon, Americans crossed a threshold from having a relatively focused eye on sensible gun control laws to summarily rejecting anything short of an expansion of gun rights. Rather than being repulsed by military-style assault weapons in the wake of mass shootings, firearms like the AR-15, the Sandy Hook weapon of choice, are sold in record numbers. Lawmakers and gun store owners alike have routinely held AR-15 giveaways after Sandy Hook -- contests that are just about as tasteless as giving away box cutters and one-way airline tickets in the aftermath of 9/11. The sole NRA-sanctioned measure to ameliorate gun violence is to simply invent new and ludicrous ways to fight back. The upshot is that we need to learn to live with mass shootings. Instead of making a serious effort to keep firearms out of the hands of would-be killers, the NRA and the gun lobby are happy to market guns to school districts for arming teachers, and to condition students to accept the potential for massacres. It's the new arms race, and it's happening exclusively inside the United States. Tell me if this sounds familiar: instead of reducing the number of available guns, the so-called ""good guys"" are being instructed to stockpile more firearms to out-gun the ""bad guys."" Where does this escalation lead? More gun sales, of course. If it sounds like the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States, it should. Furthermore, in schools and college campuses, students are participating in gun massacre drills. Our kids are being instructed how to shield themselves in case of an active shooter scenario and, really, they should just go ahead and name the drills ""Duck and Cover."" We'll circle back to this shortly. Meanwhile, the giggling couch tumors on ""Fox & Friends"" defended Dr. Ben Carson's latest remarks on the Oregon massacre. The presidential candidate and neurosurgeon told the Fox News morning show hosts, ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'"" Nice that Dr. Carson is so steady-under-fire than all those dead college students, not to mention the Sandy Hook kids, or those Virginia journalists. Good for him. While defending Carson's indefensible statement, Elisabeth Hasselbeck went off on a rant: But this is a man who spent 40 years plus bringing people back to life, giving people a chance at life. And the mainstream media wants to now mischaracterize him as someone who is dancing on graves. That's unfair, it's incorrect, and it's irresponsible. Well, Carson tried to one-up dead college students. He might not be literally dancing on graves, but he's certainly grandstanding on them. Nevertheless, here was the salient quote from the show: It's completely irresponsible to do this man whose life mission has been to give life and who is simply answering a question, which, by the way, a bunch of universities are now training their students to deal with mass shootings, potential mass shootings, as a hazard such as a tornado, a hurricane, a mass flood. They're actually training students to deal with situations particularly in the way that Dr. Ben Carson stated here. He wasn't saying that the victims there didn't do enough to defend themselves.  Yes, we've become so utterly spineless about controlling the sale of deadly firearms, we have no choice but accept gun massacres and to prepare for them like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. There's something profound about treating gun massacres like natural disasters. We're basically admitting that massacres are unpreventable, just like natural disasters -- even though there are numerous measures we could immediately take to prevent them but which the gun lobby will never allow. So, whatever. Deal with it, America. If anything represents our collective torpor on guns, it's this. Rather than seizing the initiative away from the for-profit gun industry by taking a hardline posture on guns, Republicans and Democrats alike appear to be satisfied with doing nothing and hoping that ""Duck And Cover"" drills will result in fewer mass shooting deaths. Hell, at least during the nuclear arms race there were treaties signed that curbed testing and proliferation. On guns, however, even incremental federal laws are unheard of. It's also important to note that some experts believe active shooter drills are generally ineffective. ""There ends up being zero learning going on because everyone is upset that you've scared the crap out of them,"" said Greg Crane, a former SWAT officer with the North Richland Hills Police Department near Dallas who holds seminars to teach civilians different strategies to deal with mass-shooting scenarios. The new normal on firearms is resignation and capitulation, while the crisis has grown so severe that we're treating massacres like hurricanes and, yes, preparedness for a nuclear attack. We're being convinced that we have no choice but to prepare our children for massacres that we, as adults, are too chicken-shit to have resolved before the bullets started flying. Why? Because the NRA is committed to selling millions of deadly consumer products to phallically-challenged bro-scholars who think they know something about constitutional law. Consequently, we're faced with man-made disasters on the magnitude of natural ones that, unlike tornadoes, could've been mostly prevented. Seriously, anyone marketing in this nonsense, especially Ben Carson and ""Fox & Friends,"" ought to be ashamed of themselves. Bob Cesca is a regular contributor to Salon.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/13/the_right_has_no_sense_of_decency_fox_news_jeb_bush_and_the_callous_indifference_of_modern_conservatism_partner/,"This article originally appeared on Media Matters Last week's depressingly predictable news from Oregon about another American gun massacre triggered what's now become a morose tradition of news coverage, not only about the mindless murders themselves, but also about the permanent stain of domestic gun violence. (This morning brought news of yet another campus shooting.) With a presidential campaign underway, the Oregon coverage inevitably crossed over into political and campaign analysis. That meant high-profile Republican candidates weighed in on the issue and often tried to wave off as unfixable the epidemic of gun violence in America, where approximately 290 people are shot every day. Thanks to a string of truly bizarre (""stuff happens"") and thoughtless comments from several GOP candidates, including one that seemed to place some blame on the Umpqua Community College victims for being shot, the so-called gun debate has managed to become even more baseless. In other words, the Republican field is once again highlighting just how radical the party has become on key issues. And that poses a growing challenge for journalists. ""Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe,"" wrote The New Yorker's John Cassidy this week. The question becomes how does the press cover the unfolding Republican gun spectacle? And when do reporters and pundits step forward and point out that one side of the gun 'debate' has not only lost touch with reality, but at times has lost touch with common decency? That query goes to the heart of informative political reporting. Earlier this year, I posed a similar question about the campaign press: How do journalists deal with a lineup of Republican candidates who, ignoring an avalanche of scientific findings, cling to the outdated idea that humans don't contribute to climate change? Do journalists simply tell the truth and acknowledge the obvious holes in their arguments, or do they help carve out a new political space for climate deniers that allows their views to be seen as mainstream? One example of the shameful Republican gun massacre commentary came from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. After the deadly campus rampage, the GOP candidate disparaged the father of the dead gunman. ""He's a complete failure as a father, he should be embarrassed to even show his face in public. He's the problem here,"" wrote Jindal. Meanwhile Donald Trump invented facts and claimed these sorts of public shooting sprees have ""taken place forever."" Trump insisted there's nothing we can do in America to stop them: ""But no matter what you do you will have problems and that's the way the world goes."" But it was Ben Carson who unleashed a stunning barrage of ignorant and insensitive comments while Oregon families still grieved. Carson on gun rights: ""There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking -- but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" On the victims: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say: 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" On arming teachers: ""If the [kindergarten] teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" On traveling to Oregon as president to console the victims' families: ""I mean, I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I would go to the next one."" It's true that Carson's string of baffling comments drew lots of press attention and condemnation. (Especially when he later told a story about how he had once been held at gunpoint at a Popeyes restaurant and directed the gunman to the employee behind the counter.) But I'd suggest too much of it from the political press corps was restrained in a way that would be inconceivable if, for instance, a leading Democratic candidate had callously placed blame on victims in the wake of a terror attack on American soil. From The New York Times [emphasis added]: Like many Republican presidential candidates who have sought to express sympathy for victims while maintaining support for gun rights, Mr. Carson has struggled to address the issue with sensitivity. NBC News added that Carson had ""made a number of eyebrow raising comments since the shooting last Thursday."" Raised eyebrows? Struggled with sensitivity? I don't think that comes close to capturing the imprudence of Carson's remarks. Fact is, I'm not sure journalists know how to deal with a presidential candidate who seemingly places some of the blame on the victims of a mass murder. Another example of the press not yet able to come to terms with Republican dismissiveness came whenscores of journalists rushed to Jeb Bush's defense last week after he suggested ""stuff happens,"" and that the government shouldn't always respond aggressively to crises, including mass murders. As reported by the Washington Post, Bush said: ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think that more government is necessarily the answer to this,"" he said. ""I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's just, it's very sad to see. But I resist the notion -- and I did, I had this, this challenge as governor, because we have, look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Certain Bush had simply been ""inartful"" and that he'd never cavalierly dismiss a mass murder as ""stuff happens,"" many in the press played defense and suggested the quote was taken out of context. But it wasn't. After his ""stuff happens"" comments, Bush was asked if he had misspoken and he emphatically denied he had: ""No, it wasn't a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said was wrong? Things happen all the time -- things -- is that better?"" According to the Washington Post, Bush then elaborated, likening mass shooting to kids drowning in pools: ""Things happen all the time. A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around a pool,"" he said. ""The cumulative effect of this is that in some cases, you don't solve the problem by passing the law and you're imposing on large numbers of people burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder to protect liberty."" (Gawker noted that Bush did actually sign a Florida law requiring pool fences after a child in the state nearly drowned.) ""Stuff happens"" meant exactly what Bush wanted it to mean: There's nothing the government can do about mass shootings because there's nothing the government can, or should do, about gun ownership. (As governor of Florida, Bush received an ""A+"" rating from the NRA.) The kneejerk desire to protect Bush from his own words suggests many journalists haven't come to grips with the idea that Republicans, as a matter of policy, are unwilling to reduce the number of guns in America. And that the shoulder shrug response to the Oregon tragedy indicates they're not going to try. Journalists should stop shying away from relaying that troubling truth.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/obama-rebukes-bush-on-stuff-happens-reaction-to-oregon-shootings.html?ref=first-draft&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by The Candidates By Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — Jeb Bush drew a sharp rebuke from President Obama on Friday after the Republican presidential candidate shrugged off any need for government action in the wake of the massacre of nine people at a community college in Oregon. “Look, stuff happens,” Mr. Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, said at a campaign event in South Carolina. “There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not always the right thing to do.” Mr. Obama, who in remarks the night before had denounced Congress and the entire American political system for what he called its numbness to repeated gun massacres, responded: “The American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting. They can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happens.’ ” The exchange between Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush reflected the paralysis that has settled over the issue of new gun control legislation in the United States. Virtually no member of Congress issued a statement after the Oregon shootings arguing for or against new gun control measures, and a number of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates were dismissive of new gun control measures as well. After Mr. Obama failed to get Congress to pass even modest gun control legislation after a 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., killed 20 schoolchildren, the president has put more energy into legislation where he can find common ground with Republicans. As a result, gun control advocates have for now given up on a nationwide universal background check system or other changes to gun regulations and are instead pushing for tougher gun laws in state legislatures. In the state of Washington, a ballot initiative imposed universal background checks over a recalcitrant legislature. In Oregon, the legislature also passed background checks, which went into effect several months ago. transcript na Reacting to the Oregon shootings on Friday, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican presidential candidate, said that “you can strip all the guns away but the people who are going to commit crimes or have problems are always going to have the gun.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican candidate, said there is too much focus “on what people are using to commit violence.” The Democratic presidential candidates sought to offer a sharp contrast. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has called for a renewed effort to pass universal background checks and other gun measures, posted on Twitter: “What is wrong with us that we can’t stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another Democratic presidential candidate, said that “we’ve got to do something,” although he added: “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.” Bush campaign officials, even before Mr. Obama’s rebuke, insisted that people were unfairly seizing on only part of the candidate’s comments. “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context,” said Allie Brandenburger, a campaign spokeswoman. In response to a question about whether more prayer in schools might help reduce tragedies like the shooting in Oregon, Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, said in entirety: “Yeah it’s a — we’re in a difficult time in our country, and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It’s just, it’s very sad to see. But I resist the notion, I had this challenge as governor, because, look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” Although Mr. Bush did not say explicitly there was no need for new gun control legislation, it was implicit in his message. A selection of President Obama’s comments after mass shootings. In comments made before Mr. Obama spoke, he also said he had not made a mistake in his initial comments: “Things happen all the time. Things. Is that better?” Mr. Obama ordered flags at the White House on Friday to half-staff to honor the victims of the shooting. “When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer,” he said on Thursday night as early reports of the dead and injured in Oregon reached the White House. “When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.” Gun control advocates continued to say they have given up on Congress, which has more pro-gun lawmakers now than at the time of the Newtown massacre. “We almost have to act as if Congress doesn’t exist,” Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the retiring mayor of Baltimore, said in an interview Friday. “I don’t know if Congress is numb or just has a conviction to inaction on this issue.” Ms. Rawlings-Blake, who will lead a discussion about the gun violence issue at a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors this weekend, said a national effort to confront the spread of guns would be preferable, because states with lax gun laws affect those with tougher ones. This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. “We have one gun shop in this city,” she said, blaming the surge in violence in Baltimore in part on a flow of guns from outside the borders of Maryland. “We know that the I-95 corridor is responsible for the tracking of illegal guns up and down the East Coast.” John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded in part by the former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, compared the push for new gun laws to the successful fight for marriage equality, which progressed first in the states before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in June. “The arc for success here is just like the arc for marriage equality,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “I think people are actually angry. If Washington chooses to do nothing, the rest of the country is not waiting around.” Polling suggests that the country remains divided on the question of the need for more gun control, even if that tide is slowly shifting in favor of regulation. An August report on guns in the United States by the Pew Research Center found that 50 percent of Americans thought it was more important to control gun ownership, while 47 percent thought protecting the right to own guns should be a priority. Opinions are split deeply along partisan lines, with nearly three-fourths of Democrats favoring gun control and 71 percent of Republicans saying gun rights are most important. The study found, however, that there was broad support for expanding background checks for private gun sales and for legislation preventing the mentally ill from buying guns among people who want gun ownership rights.

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/attorney-688078-case-deputies.html,"Trending:  Judge Richard King will have to decide whether to proceed with sentencing or grant Eric Ortiz a new trial.  Defense attorney Rudolph Loewenstein says the deputies' silence hurts his client's chance for a fair trial.  In a Santa Ana courtroom, Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy Seth Tunstall raised his right hand to take the oath and stepped onto the witness stand. “You are employed by the Orange County Sheirff’s Department?” a defense attorney asked. “After conferring with my attorney I’m going to decline to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds,” Tunstall replied. Tunstall was followed by three more deputies called to testify in a hearing on a gang-related murder. One by one, each deputy said the same thing: nothing. All four invoked their rights against self-incrimination, declining to reveal even the most basic information, including where they work and whether they attended a police academy. The refusal of the four Orange County sheriff’s deputies to testify this month means a Santa Ana man can’t receive a fair hearing in a case that could send him to prison for life, his attorney contends. The criminal case is one of many ensnared in Orange County’s jailhouse informant scandal, which this year prompted a judge to remove the entire staff of the District Attorney’s Office from the trial in the county’s worst mass shooting. RELATED STORIES: Watchdog: County ponders jailhouse snitch investigation Families of those killed at Seal Beach salon still struggling for justice After Orange County D.A. kicked off case from jailhouse informants, prosecutors face stricter standards The latest legal challenge comes from Eric Ortiz, a 26-year-old gang member convicted in January for a 2011 fatal shooting in Santa Ana. Before Ortiz could be sentenced, however, Superior Court Judge Richard King granted him a hearing on whether he should receive a new trial based on disclosures about the use of a jailhouse snitch in his prosecution. Rudolph Loewenstein, Ortiz’s defense attorney, contends four deputies – Tunstall and colleagues Benjamin Garcia, William Grover and Bryan Larson – possess key information as to how authorities violated Ortiz’s constitutional rights by using an informant to gather incriminating statements. But in a weeklong hearing this month, the case hit a snag when the four deputies invoked their Fifth Amendment rights. All four came to court with their own defense attorneys. “It’s shocking that we have members of law enforcement sworn to uphold the law and they’re refusing to testify because their answers might incriminate them,” Loewenstein said. “If that doesn’t shake the public’s faith in the system, I don’t know what does.” Peace officer rights The attorney noted that King also has said the deputies have relevant information about the case. It is not yet clear whether the deputies will face any repercussions for refusing to testify. Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said in a statement the department is reviewing the circumstances behind each deputy’s decision and will “pursue additional investigations and manage assignments as needed.” “I take the matter very seriously and have a number of concerns as I continue to monitor and review the facts emerging across different investigations and court cases,” Hutchens said. Tom Dominguez, president of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, said peace officers are afforded the same constitutional rights as all citizens. “They do not lose those constitutional protections when they pin on the badge,” he said. The Fifth Amendment fully applies to law enforcement, but it’s “exceptionally rare” for a police officer or deputy to invoke the Fifth Amendment as a witness in a criminal case, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University. The Ortiz case, Rosenthal said, is additional fallout from the “sloppy handling of informants” by the District Attorney’s Office. “The office has jeopardized what may turn out to be dozens of very serious cases from their own carelessness,” he said. Several cases have now been affected by disclosures alleging prosecutors and police improperly used jailhouse informants and withheld evidence. Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders and other defense attorneys are challenging many others. Two other murder cases and two attempted-murder cases have resulted in plea deals and reduced sentences in the wake of the scandal. Death penalty trial stalled In an unprecedented move in March, Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals removed the entire District Attorney’s Office from the penalty phase for the trial of Scott Dekraai, who admitted killing eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. In his ruling, Goethals said deputies Tunstall and Garcia, who both worked in the Orange County Jail as part of a special handling unit, “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence” about the existence of so-called TRED records, which log movements of inmates, including jailhouse informants. Authorities have not said whether the deputies will face possible charges as a result of their testimony in the Dekraai case. District Attorney Chief of Staff Susan Kang Schroeder deferred questions to the state Attorney General’s Office, which is investigating the matter. Tunstall, a 14-year veteran and a statewide expert on the Mexican Mafia, was the first deputy called to testify in the Ortiz case on Oct. 6. He declined to answer all questions under oath. Tunstall also has refused to testify as a key witness in cases involving the Mexican Mafia, which has forced prosecutors to reconsider charges. Following the testimony, King asked how basic questions on Tunstall’s professional background could lead to self-incrimination. “What crime would his testimony reveal that he would be subject to criminal liability?” the judge asked. In response, Tunstall’s attorney Paul Meyer said foundational questions on Tunstall’s employment are “links in a chain” that lead to areas where he could raise the Fifth Amendment “without any question.” Meyer noted that invoking constitutional rights is not an admission of wrongdoing. “A witness who takes the Fifth or invokes the Fifth Amendment is doing so based on a possibility of a possible theory, even if it’s disputed and it’s not well established in fact,” he said in court. Waiting for the appeals The judge ruled Oct. 8 that all four deputies had met their burden of proof to invoke the Fifth Amendment because of possible exposure to charges of perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Dekraai case. Meyer, in a statement, said the deputies were all advised by their attorneys to invoke their rights. “While we believe that Judge Goethals’ ruling will be proven wrong by the appellate courts, and by the facts, an invocation of rights was the right call until the pending investigations are concluded,” Meyer said. Ortiz was arrested in 2011, five years after the shooting death of Emeterio Adame, 51, outside a home in Santa Ana. When a key witness fell through before the trial, Loewenstein contends authorities conspired to place Ortiz next to informant and convicted burglar Donald Geary inside the Orange County Jail to gain incriminating statements. Under the Massiah rule, authorities are barred from attempting to elicit incriminating statements from a suspect who is already represented by an attorney. Geary, who testified in the case, said he was not prompted by law enforcement to question Ortiz. Both prosecutors who handled the case, Eric Peterson and, more recently, Seton Hunt, denied any misconduct in the case. Ortiz is due back in court Oct. 30, when King will hear final arguments. The judge is then expected to issue a ruling on whether to move forward with sentencing or grant the defense’s request for a new trial. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has said his prosecutors made “missteps” but said those were not intentional. Rackauckas in the past year conducted an in-house investigation that has resulted in office changes to better track the use of informants. Rackauckas also has enlisted a committee of legal experts to review his office’s use of jailhouse informants. The committee’s findings are due by the end of the year.

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/trump_on_oregon_shooting_youre_going_to_have_these.html,"TRENTON -- A day after a shooter killed nine people and wounded nine others at a community college in Oregon, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said Friday that no matter how strong the U.S. makes it gun laws, ""you're going to have these things happen."" Trump's comments came less than 24 hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday -- an incident that prompted President Obama to give an impassioned speech calling once again for tighter gun control legislation. Appearing via phone on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Trump offered a different perspective when asked what he'd do to prevent mass shootings if he were elected to the White House. The billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino magnate said the country already has ""very strong laws on the books."" ""But you're always going to have problems,"" said Trump, who is leading his 14 rivals for the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- in the polls. ""We have millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world. And it does happen all over the world."" MORE: N.J.'s House Democrats: Protect Americans from gun violence Trump -- who released a policy paper last month calling for the expansion of rights for legal gun owners -- noted that school shootings are ""unique to this country."" And he blamed mental illness for the issue. In his paper, Trump advocates for better programs to treat mental illness, though he doesn't specify how. ""It is a terrible situation,"" the real estate mogul and former reality television host told MSNBC on Friday. ""It's huge mental illness. You're going to have these things happen. And it's a horrible thing to behold."" Host Willie Geist asked Trump is it's ""fair to say"" his opinion is that ""some people are going to slip through the cracks, and there's nothing you can do about it."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty, it would be, for the next million years,"" Trump replied. ""People are going to slip through the cracks. Even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks."" Trump noted that many shooters in mass killings are ""loners"" and ""have all sorts of difficulties."" ""There are many people like that,"" he said. ""What are you gonna do, institutionalize everybody?"" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is shown on the campaign trail. Trump was one of a few Republican presidential candidates Friday who said that despite yet another mass shooting, tougher gun laws are not the answer. Speaking in Iowa, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said ""you're not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal law-abiding citizens. ""It doesn't work for crazies,"" Carson said. Speaking in South Carolina -- the site of the Charleston church shooting this summer -- former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said ""before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have."" Fiorina -- who was an executive at Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill before her time at HP -- also said President Obama's remarks after the shooting were ""premature at best and at worst a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy."" Obama made his comments hours after the shooting Thursday. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" the Democratic president told reporters during  a news conference at the White House. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' Well, this is something we should politicize,"" he added. It was the 11th time during Obama's seven years as president that he delivered a speech in the wake of a mass shooting in America. A 2014 report by the FBI found that even though homicides have dropped overall in the U.S., mass shootings have risen drastically over the last seven years. And research by Harvard University scholars shows that a mass shooting has occurred every 64 days on average in America since 2011. Christie, who was in Cape May County preparing for the possibility of Hurricane Joaquin hitting New Jersey, did not issue a statement Friday about the shooting.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/11/ben-carson-gives-new-meaning-to-crazy.html,"SEARCH His various answers this week leave one perplexed as how he has so much support. For more than a few months many campaign experts and pundits have been trying to figure out how and why semi-prominent surgeon and political nut-boy Ben Carson has been doing so well in the Republican race for president. He has maintained healthy numbers in the polls and seems locked into a strong second place position in a field of candidates where experience and common sense are viewed as huge liabilities. But it wasn’t until last week that Carson managed to prove he has lost more than a few shingles off his roof. Ben has his own space program going and he’s out there on the fringe talking nonsense in a soft, nonthreatening manner that is quite similar to the voice level heard among so many sitting sadly by themselves today in Day Rooms of mental institutions, off in a corner, wearing paper slippers, slowly eating apple sauce, unaware that nobody is listening. Somewhat incredibly though, a small percentage of people are listening to Gentle Ben. And he is indeed running for president of the United States. And each day he takes the field and gives new meaning to crazy. A few days ago, Ben was asked about the latest mass shooting on a college campus in Oregon where nine died because a mentally deranged young guy had 14 guns and no girlfriend. WWBD: What would Ben do? “I’m glad you asked that question,” one of the two leading presidential candidates of the Republican Party replied. “because not only would I not probably not co-operate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” And there it is. Ben is clearly a movie buff. Ben probably saw himself as Little Bill in Unforgiven who was confronted by William Munny in a saloon showdown. Little Bill was a bad-ass sheriff, a bully who had beaten to death Munny’s only friend, Ned, and hung the body outside the saloon. In the scene that perhaps excited Ben, Little Bill is promising free drinks and prattling an empty-headed moron, a guy the crowd listens to because he’s wearing a badge. Little Bill is surprised though as Munny arrives, rifle in hand and shoots the skinny bar owner. Then Little Bill and William Munny confront one another. “Well, sir, “ Little Bill says, “You are a cowardly son of a bitch because you have just shot down an unarmed man.” “He should have armed himself if he was gonna’ decorate his saloon with the body of my friend,” Munny tells Little Bill. At that moment, Little Bill seems to recognize Munny and says, “I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children,” And Munny tells him, “I have done that…killed women and children. I have killed most everything that walks or crawls and now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.” Right here is where Ben Carson starts taking notes. He must have been mesmerized because, clearly, it has had a huge impact on his outlook. “He’s got one barrel left, gentlemen, “ Little Bill announces to his saloon pals who are either cowering or heading for the nearest exit. “After he has used it, pull your pistols and shoot him down like the cowardly, drunken scoundrel he is.” Ben wanted the students at that Oregon Community College to charge the shooter. After all, he only had four weapons on him. If Ben had more time to think he probably would have woven a few scenes from Saving Private Ryan into his answer. After all, the Germans on the bluff above Omaha Beach had multiple weapons but they were beaten back because we charged them. A few days later, Ben was on CNN where he insisted that the number of Holocaust victims would have been greatly reduced if more Jewish people in Europe owned guns. Here he is on that topic: “I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.” (We pause here for a quick, commercial-free reminder: This guy, Ben Carson, is running for president of the United States and according to many polls is placing second to Donald Trump as the potential candidate of one of two major American political parties, the Republican Party.) His supporters list several reasons why they would consider voting for him: “He seems like a nice man. He speaks softly. He is a fine Christian. He speaks his mind.” He is also a few quarts short of a gallon. But when it comes to Ben Carson’s preposterous campaign, count me in with Chauncey Gardiner who said in Being There: “I like to watch.”"

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/09/bill-maher-defends-hillary-clinton-i-don-t-understand-anybody-who-hates-her.html,"SEARCH The host of HBO’s ‘Real Time with Bill Maher’ slammed Ben Carson and passionately came to the defense of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Senior Entertainment Editor Bill Maher is no fan of Donald Trump. The political satirist and host of HBO’s late-night talk show Real Time with Bill Maher tees off on the GOP’s presidential frontrunner every week, and was once sued by The Donald for $5 million over a joke comparing him to an ape. But on Friday’s edition of Real Time, Maher largely avoided prodding the xenophobic real estate mogul, and instead aimed his ire at the surging Ben Carson, who, in the wake of the horrific mass shooting in Oregon that left nine people murdered, has turned the crazy switch all the way to ‘11,’ claiming the Jews could have avoided the Holocaust if they’d been armed, and that American kindergarten teachers should be armed and trained in “diversionary tactics.” In other words, all kindergarten teachers should be Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character from Kindergarten Cop. Carson also told a vague, questionable story about one time when a man pulled a gun on him at a local Popeyes, and Carson allegedly diffused the situation with his whispers. “Ben Carson, by the way, is for real in the Republican Party. Oh, yeah. Ben Carson. Deal with it, people,” said Maher. “He was commenting on the school shooting last week in Oregon and he said, ‘I wouldn’t have just let them shoot me. I would’ve said, hey guys, everybody attack the shooter. He can’t get all of us.’ And then he told this story the next day about how Ben Carson himself, he said, he did once come face-to-face with such a situation. He was in Popeyes Chicken—this is what he said—and a guy stuck a gun in his ribs, and this is what Ben Carson, by his own accounts, said he told the gunman with the gun in his ribs. He said, ‘I believe you want the guy behind the counter.’ OK, this is not quite, ‘Let’s all get ‘em!’ this is offering up someone else. ‘Don’t shoot me! Get the guy in the paper hat with the polyester suit!’” But all the talk of Carson (and Trump) led guest Andrew Sullivan to ask, “Who’s up against this guy? This unbelievably useless, terrible candidate in Hillary Clinton!” Then Maher came to her defense—first reservedly, then passionately. “I find her slogan ‘Are you ready for Hillary?’ to perfectly capsulize how I feel about her,” said Maher. “Am I ready for Hillary? Yes. Am I excited? No. It’s like getting a shot. Are you ready? Yes, I’m ready for it.” As for Hillary’s numbers, which have gone down consistently since she began campaigning, Maher blamed the press. “Maybe that’s not her fault,” he said. “Maybe it’s the press, who has it out for her—including the liberal press, by the way. It’s not that she can’t handle it, it’s that people can’t handle it. People believe what they read, if they ever fuckin’ read.”  “She’s a talent-free hack!” exclaimed Sullivan.“She’s not ‘talent-free,’ Andrew! And she’s not a hack!” Maher responded. “Why do you hate her so much? Were you molested by a real estate lady? I can understand you not wanting Hillary to be president, but I don’t understand anybody who hates her. She is a boring centrist. It just should never rise to the level of hatred.”   “If you’re asking me if she’s a calculating politician, yes. Is that the most desirable thing in the world? No,” he continued. “But I live in the real world. I’d rather have a politician who calculates than one who can’t.”"

https://www.bustle.com/articles/115351-bernie-sanders-gun-control-stance-might-hurt-him-in-the-first-democratic-debate,"News  As the nation grows closer to the first Democratic primary debate, some experts are beginning to wonder whether Bernie Sanders' gun control stance might hurt him. Until now, his moderate stance on gun control and gun rights has mostly flown under the radar, given the candidate's reputation for being extremely progressive. But in the wake of the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Sanders' voting history in terms of gun control has come back to haunt him. To be clear, Sanders is not pro-gun. But he isn't anti-gun, either. Instead, he's caught in a strange political limbo: someone who believes in gun rights, but also desires gun law reform. And it makes sense, considering that Sanders hails from Vermont, a state where recreational hunting is popular. And the pro-gun community has been good to him. While seeking a position in Congress in 1990, Sanders was actually endorsed by the NRA as ""more honorable choice for Vermont sportsmen"" than his competitor. And his voting record has shown a sensitivity to gun rights and gun manufacturers as well. Many critics of his stance point to his voting record from the 1990s, in which he voted against the Brady Bill, which would have expanded background checks. In 2005, he voted in favor of a bill that barred individuals from lodging lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Hillary Clinton, his main challenger, voted against it. But he also has a substantial record of voting in favor of reform, such as in 1994 when he supported banning assault weapons, and in 2013 when he reversed his earlier vote and supported a bill that would expand background checks. But when compared to the other Democratic candidates, Sanders is not even close to being the most progressive on the matter. ""We need a comprehensive approach. We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them,"" said a statement released by Sanders' campaign following the Oregon shooting. ""We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help they need when they need it. We also have to tone down the incredibly high level of gratuitous violence which permeates our media."" On the far left of Sanders are Clinton and Martin O'Malley, who both have strong gun control records, and have made reform key issues within their campaigns. Following the shooting, O'Malley announced his desire for efforts such as banning assault weapons, utilizing finger print records, and making gun trafficking a federal crime. During town hall meetings, O'Malley reiterated his success as mayor of Baltimore at cracking down on gun violence, while calling on Clinton and Sanders to support his initiatives. On Monday, Clinton released a comprehensive policy plan for gun control that would include repealing the 2005 bill that Sanders supported, as well as closing the gun show background check loophole. And like O'Malley, her previous history gives her credibility â as a senator, Clinton co-sponsored legislation aimed toward combating the gun show loophole. The candidates will meet on stage in Nevada on Oct. 13 for the first time to debate, and gun control will almost definitely be main subject. O'Malley and Clinton are prepared and ready to discuss their backgrounds, as well as what they would do as president. But Sanders is likely to avoid engaging, and will reiterate his desire for ""sensible gun control."" In other venues, this tactic may work for Sanders and appeal to voters. But with emotions still running high following last week's shooting, it may spell bad news for Sanders. He's a candidate who favors facts and figures. But unfortunately for Sanders, the facts show that he's not the most progressive when it comes to gun control. And voters might not be willing to compromise this time. Choose an edition:"

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/04/fact-checking-the-sunday-shows-october-4.html,"SEARCH Trump was challenged on Syrian migrants and Mark Kelly was questioned about a dated gun statistic. By Joshua Gillin, Linda Qiu and Katie Sanders Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump defended his change in position on accepting refugees from Syria on Sunday, saying he has concerns about how many able-bodied men seem to be fleeing the war-torn nation. “The migration was strange to me, because it seems like so many men,” Trump said on ABC’s This Week. “There aren’t that many women, there aren’t that many children. It looked like mostly men, and they looked like strong men.” Host George Stephanopoulos interjected, saying “half the refugees are children.” But Trump went on to say the admission of thousands of men arriving without documentation “could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse.” Trump, whose campaign did not respond for comment, is conflating his talking point over a couple of different issues and refugee populations. We rate the statement False. Stephanopoulos was asking him about his changed position on Syrian refugees who would be coming to the United States. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees counts a total of more than 4 million Syrian refugees, and of those 4 million, 50.3 percent are female, and 51.1 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. In all, only 23.5 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the UN were men older than 18. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, says Trump’s anecdote may have been referring to Europe’s mass influx of refugees and migrants, not the registered refugees in camps that Stephanopoulos was asking about. Trump likely meant so-called “sea arrivals,” refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The UN counts almost 534,000 people who have crossed into Europe this year, with almost 3,000 dying during the journey. To Trump’s point, 69 percent of sea arrivals are men, and these are the people dominating headlines about the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Slightly more than half of them are from Syria, and many are undocumented. But the problem with Trump’s statement is that none of the majority-male refugees and migrants in Europe are coming to the United States. The UN has said 10 percent, or about 400,000, of the Syrian refugees in camps need to be resettled. President Barack Obama announced that in fiscal year 2016 (through September 30), the United States would accept at least 10,000 refugees from Syria. Those 10,000 aren’t necessarily the type of people who would be ISIS operatives as Trump fears, according to Mock. “The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,” Mock said. The people selected undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the process can take years. Outdated gun statistic As the country grapples with Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college, retired astronaut Mark Kelly is continuing his charge for stricter gun control. Kelly is married to former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), who was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson that left 10 others dead. Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control. ""One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check,"" Kelly said during CNN’s State of the Union. Kelly’s statistic isn’t as clear as it sounds. We rate it Half True. The claim about lax background checks is based on a 1994 survey by Duke University’s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago’s Jens Ludwig. The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases from licensed dealers, was enacted. There’s debate on whether a 21-year-old statistic still holds up today. Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check. Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is ""notoriously slippery,"" as gun sales that don’t go through a federally licensed seller are not subject to formal recordkeeping.

http://www.ibtimes.com/barack-obama-umpqua-cc-speech-full-text-read-presidents-oregon-shooting-statement-2124082,"President Barack Obama delivered a news conference from the White House, voicing anger and sadness as he responded to a massacre on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, that left at least 10 people dead. The gunman, identified by police as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, injured several others before being killed by police. He reportedly was not a student of the school. In the president's speech, Obama called for Americans to push their elected officials to act to prevent gun violence. He also tasked the media with creating graphics comparing the number of gun-related deaths to the number of terrorism-related deaths. He noted that gun-related deaths were vastly more common, yet terrorism deaths received more attention.  See his full remarks here: There’s been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever. That means there’s another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children. I’ve been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there. I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today. Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we’ve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need. In the coming days, we’ll learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.  And America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.  It’s not enough.  It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.  And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.  But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, “The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.”  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day!  Somehow this has become routine.  The reporting is routine.  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.  The conversation in the aftermath of it.  We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country -- they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America. So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize.  It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.  I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.  This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.  We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.  And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.  How can that be? This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.  We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.  When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer.  When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer.  When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities.  We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.  So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn’t make sense. So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.  And that will require a change of politics on this issue.  And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.  If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you. And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up.  Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws.  And this is not something I can do by myself.  I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances.  But based on my experience as President, I can't guarantee that.  And that's terrible to say.  And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back. And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change."
http://www.inquisitr.com/2482302/ben-carson-told-popeyes-gunman-you-want-the-guy-behind-the-counter/,"After a media backlash against his advice for shooting victims, Ben Carson talked about his encounter with a gunman in a Popeye's restaurant. There are just two problems. First, Carson did not rush the shooter as he advised other victims to do. And second, the encounter may not have happened at all. The GOP presidential candidate became a lightning rod after telling the hosts on Fox and Friends that he ""would not just stand there and let them shoot me.""   The comments were in response to the mass shooting in Umpqua Community College that left nine people dead. Carson clarified that he was not judging the victims at all later that night, but the criticism had already started. On Thursday, Ben Carson discussed the topic further and talked about his own experience with a dangerous shooter. Unfortunately for the former neurosurgeon, his tale is only drawing more of a backlash. On SiriusXM radio, Carson explained he was in a Popeye's Chicken in Baltimore many years ago when a gunman entered.     The story seemed to contradict Ben Carson's previous suggestions, since he was apparently just standing there, and actually pointing the gunman to another target. Still, the situations were not identical. Does Carson believe that people should rush the gunman in all situations, or only after he has opened fire? But the media is concerned with another question about the doctor's narrative. Did it really happen at all? According to the New York Daily News, the police aren't sure. In response to multiple media requests, the Baltimore police sent out this tweet.   Based on the information that #BenCarson mentioned, there was not enough info to identify a police report in reference to the incident. — Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) October 8, 2015  Based on the information that #BenCarson mentioned, there was not enough info to identify a police report in reference to the incident. — Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) October 8, 2015  They added that a date and specific location would help them track down the records.   Furthermore, what was a vegetarian doing in a Popeye's Chicken restaurant to begin with? (Dr. Carson has said that he never liked eating meat much.) Armstrong Williams, Carson's business manager and central adviser, filled in some of the details on the story. Ben Carson frequented a Popeye's Chicken near John Hopkins University when he was a resident there some 30 years ago. He wasn't entirely a vegetarian at the time, and he liked Popeye's for the coleslaw, biscuits, and other sides. When the Daily Beast asked why this incident never came up in any of the doctor's personal stories or biographies, Williams explained that he probably didn't want to ""seem braggadocios."" Armstrong added that the Republican candidate remained calm and managed to ""diffuse"" the incident. Despite Williams' positive spin on the story, major media outlets are taking it as proof the doctor doesn't practice what he preaches. The headline from Mashable says Ben Carson threw the cashier ""under the bus."" The Popeye's tale isn't the only factor ratcheting up the criticism. On Wednesday, Oregon shooting survivor Mathew Downing told CNN that he was offended by Ben Carson's comments.   As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Downing was the ""lucky one."" The shooter reportedly told Mathew ""You, with the glasses, you're the lucky one. If you give this envelope to police, you'll live."" Ben Carson's Popeye's story may have only made matters worse for the presidential contender, but his popularity among conservatives has still earned him second place in the polls since late August.

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obama-putin-congress-gun-control-214399,"White House In a freewheeling news conference, the president smacks down Putin, Congress and gun control opponents. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 10/02/2015 08:34 PM EDT AP Photo It’s not just the fourth quarter. It’s trash talk time. President Barack Obama’s never done a good job hiding his disdain for the people he doesn’t like—a long list that includes reporters, Republicans, pretty much every member of Congress, the foreign leaders he considers petty and childish (Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyanu most of all). Everyone would see things his way, he tends to project, if only they were a little smarter and thought it through as thoroughly as he has. Usually when he’s explaining why the world’s wrong and he’s right, he’s looking down his nose and drily lecturing, getting deep into wonky policy explications that leave even his staff yawning and too confused or bored to explain. On Friday afternoon in the State Dining Room, at a wide-ranging press conference, he was just having a good time. He showed up ready to mock, with an unimpressed, exaggerated upside down smile just one right cheek mole short of a Robert DeNiro impression. The smile popped up again and again, as he swept his hand to dismiss questions, cutting off one reporter reciting criticism of him versus Putin with a wrap-it-up finger motion and saying, “I get it,” then sneering through a takedown that ended with him taking a beat like he’d been training at the Friar’s Club: “So – what was the question again?” On Jeb Bush's dismissal of a school shooting in Oregon as “stuff happens"": “I don’t even think I need to react to that one.'' On the upcoming fight with Congress over the debt ceiling, with a laugh: “I’m sure the speaker’s race complicates these negotiations.'' The most pronounced smirk came as he brushed off people who don’t agree with him on guns: “There are all sort of crackpot theories floating around,” Obama said, “some of which are sometimes ratified by elected officials in the other party.” By SARAH WHEATON Not that he didn’t have things to be genuinely torn up about: He was announcing the departure of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, one of the few members of the Cabinet left from the days when the administration was all promise and potential, and an actual friend. He’d kicked off the week shadowboxing with Putin and having to sit through a 90-minute bilateral that went nowhere, only to wake up the next morning and find out that Russia had just started bombing American interests in Syria before they’d remembered to return the calls to administration officials looking to work out a plan. And Thursday night, he’d stood in the White House briefing room grieving another mass shooting, tears in his eyes as he admitted there wasn’t much he could do except keep talking about it, and have his staff spend the evening tweeting about it. But Obama’s been in ""rhymes-with-bucket-list"" mode for months, riding high from a spring where all of a sudden his presidency seemed to come together, embracing poll numbers that he and the West Wing assumed were never going to go up, and watching with glee as he’s outlasted people who’ve made his life hell (not a lot of weeping in the Oval Office about John Boehner’s tail-between-his-legs resignation). Even a very bad week, capped off by Hurricane Joaquin ensuring he’s not getting any rounds of golf this weekend, didn’t shake that. His administration’s history in Syria is such a jumbled mess of false starts and assumptions proved wrong that he spent half an hour in response to the first question asked, and managed to say nothing new. But, hey, he said, that’s a lot better than what anyone else has got. “When I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in the situation, what I’d like to see people ask is, ‘Specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do and how would you fund it and how would you sustain it?’” Obama said. ""Typically what you get is a bunch of mumbo jumbo.” Putin, meanwhile, is just a liar, Obama said—a silly, weakened, ridiculous liar, as anyone could see. Obama smacked away statements the Russian president made in public and in private in their Monday sitdown. He even did a double shot of mine’s-bigger-than-yours, tearing into the size and growth of the Russian economy and noting with pleasure that though Putin seemed confident in his America-bashing, Assad-supporting address to the General Assembly in New York, “I didn’t see after that speech at the United Nations suddenly that 60-nation coalition we have lining up behind him.” Obama said he knows Putin wants to draw him into a proxy war in Syria. Of course he does—that’s what a small power like Putin would want to do, he said. But he’s not biting, and he sees a quagmire coming for the Russians (just like Putin’s other “brilliant” geopolitical moves around Ukraine) despite all their strutting. “Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength, but out of weakness,” Obama said, to protect Assad, “his client.” This is a predictable routine from a flailing leader whose “actions have been successful only insofar as its boosted his poll ratings inside of Russia'' -- which is a lot ""easier to do when you've got a state controlled media."" So on Syria, Obama said, he’s not surprised by the Russian moves (although his aides this week spent time expressing their own surprise at what the fighter jets were doing up in the air around Damascus). By MICHAEL CROWLEY “What they’re doing now is not particularly different from what they’ve done in the past,” Obama said. “They’re just more open about it.” And back in Washington, there won’t be a fight about the debt ceiling, he explained, basically because he said so: “We’re not going back there.” Obama did more of a second grade teacher routine than the usual college professor, walking the room through his rundown of what the debt ceiling is and why Republicans don’t understand what the difference is between raising it and new spending. “It’s not that complicated. The math is the math,” he said. Or, of course, they could do what they were doing in insisting on a government shutdown unless he defunded Planned Parenthood, and “throw a tantrum.” “Thank you guys for your patience,” Obama said, ending the press conference, speaking to the children of the outgoing and new Education secretaries, who'd sat through the hour-plus news conference. But it also sounded like he was dismissing everyone else from class, ahead of the weekend. “You can now go home.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

October 12, 2015 State authorities’ decision Sunday to erect a monument to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the site of a Confederate memorial on Stone Mountain, Ga., has again underscored rising tensions over the Confederacy’s role in US history. The announcement, which faces mixed reactions from locals, is emblematic of an increasingly divisive discourse taking place across the South in the wake of the mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., in June. The shooter, a self-professed white supremacist, had published a racist manifesto and unfurled the Confederate battle flag in photos. Since then, a nationwide debate has raged over symbols of the Confederacy, which some have insisted are a vital part of the country’s history and others decried as a relic of the South’s racist past. As The Christian Science Monitor’s Patrik Jonsson wrote: [T]he history of the Confederacy – and what it means to the South – is up for debate as never before from Kentucky to Mississippi. That Confederate monuments may no longer be sacred – and could even be unbolted and removed – suggests rapidly evolving moral and intellectual views of the South's complicated past, historians say. Those insights, unleashed by violence in the same city where the Civil War began, appear to be forcing a national reckoning over the power of rebel symbols, even those once seen as largely innocuous. In some ways, the new project in Georgia epitomizes the discourse. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association, with Republican Gov. Nathan Deal's approval, plans to build a tower with a replica of the Liberty Bell just beyond the carvings of Confederate heroes Gen. Robert E. Lee, President Jefferson Davis, and Gen. Stonewall Jackson to celebrate Mr. King’s reference to the site in his famous “I Have A Dream” speech: “Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.” “It is one of the best-known speeches in US history,” said Bill Stephens, the association’s CEO, to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “We think it’s a great addition to the historical offerings we have here.” “A monument like this should bring people together,” one local told the paper. Not everyone agrees. “This is an insult to us,” said Tim Pilgrim, head of the Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. “This is like the government going down to Auburn Avenue and putting a monument of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson on top of the King monument. How would supporters of Martin Luther King feel about that?” Similar episodes are playing out across the nation. In Mississippi – the heart of the Deep South and whose state flag is the only one that incorporates the “rebel X”  – the debate has divided cities and officials alike. On Sunday, about 400 people gathered for a rally outside the state capitol in an effort to push the state government to remove the Confederate symbol from the state flag, The Associated Press reported. ""What was the Civil War fought over?"" Mississippi-born rapper David Banner told the wire service. ""Be honest. Slavery."" But as state Sen. Melanie Sojourner argued on her Facebook page in June: “The flag was no more the ‘source’ of horrible acts against mankind than a gun is the ‘source’ of someone’s death. The ‘source’ is the hatred and evil that resides in the hearts of some who live and have lived among us.... Simply placing the blame on something that some see as a symbol only perpetuates the problem.” As contentious as the issue has become, some states have found ways to forge ahead. In South Carolina, for instance, the Confederate battle flag that had flown over the State House in Columbia for more than half a century was furled for the first time in July “amid cheers, even as some Southerners hung their heads, unbelieving that a flag they believe represents solely the valor of Southern soldiers defending their land had come to represent hatred and oppression,” the Monitor reported. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. The flag’s removal to what is set to become a multimillion-dollar shrine at the state’s “relic room” in Columbia heralded the beginning of a new era in South Carolina, long burdened by deep racial tensions. “This moment is about more than a flag or a vote,” Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin tweeted at the time. “It’s about the hope that now, 150 years after the end of the Civil War, we have grown beyond our differences and have begun to grow together.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/11/bernie-sanders-democrat-gun-control-record?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter,"First published on Sun 11 Oct 2015 14.00 BST Bernie Sanders has used an appearance before a large crowd in Colorado and an NBC interview to continue his attempt to reassure voters in the Democratic primary about his position on gun control.  “I am not going to tell you that everybody in America agrees with everyone on these ideas,” he told a crowd of 9,000 in Boulder on Saturday afternoon, a day after he spoke to more than 10,000 in Tucson, Arizona. “But I will you tell you that poll after poll tells us that gun owners and non-gun owners believe in commonsense approaches which make sure that we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns.” Sanders has come under scrutiny since the shooting dead of nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on 1 October returned gun control to the headlines. The state he represents as an independent senator, Vermont, has some of the most lax gun control laws in the country. As his rivals in both parties have pointed out, his voting record on gun control legislation is varied. In 1993, for example, when in the House of Representatives, he voted against the so-called Brady bill, which mandated federal background checks. Since the Roseburg shooting, in which nine people were also injured by a gunman who killed himself after being wounded by police, Hillary Clinton, Sanders’ main rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has released new gun control proposals including universal background checks. Barack Obama has discussed the use of executive actions to bypass the Republican-controlled Congress and close some federal loopholes. At a media event which Sanders attended, Senate Democrats unveiled proposals of their own. In Boulder, Sanders said there was “widespread support to ban semi-automatic assault weapons – guns which have no other purpose but to kill people”. The last attempt at such a ban, in the aftermath of the December 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, failed with other measures in the Senate. On NBC, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd questioned Sanders about his “moderate” stance on gun control. “I wouldn’t use the word moderation,” Sanders said. “I come from a state that has virtually no gun control. And yet, at political peril, I voted for an instant background check, which I want to see strengthened and expanded. I voted to ban certain types of assault weapons which are designed only to kill people. I voted to end the so-called gun show [purchase] loophole. “What I did say is that we even keep shouting at each other, which is what’s been going on here for 20 years. Ain’t going nowhere. And kids on campuses and children in schools are being slaughtered. What I think there needs to be is a dialogue.” If mass shootings are counted as incidents in which four or more people are killed or injured, in just under three years since 20 children and six adults were shot dead at Sandy Hook there have been around 1,000 mass shootings in the US. The nonprofit Gun Violence Archive project put the total US gun deaths in 2015 at 10,249 as of Saturday night. Nonetheless, federal reform attempts have failed and opinion polls show public support for second-amendment rights to be strengthening. In Roseburg on Friday – the day of fatal campus shootings in Arizona and Texas – Obama was greeted with protests over his visit with families of the victims and its supposed “politicisation” of the town’s own mass shooting. The 15 Republican candidates for president are uniformly against gun control, often citing after mass shootings the need for improved mental health care or for teachers and students to be armed. At the Boulder rally on Saturday, in the latest in a series of long stump speeches to large and enthusiastic crowds, Sanders pursued the mental health line. “The truth is,” he said, “that in America today, there are thousands of people walking the streets for months ... who are suicidal and have homicidal thoughts. And yet for those people it is very difficult in many cases to access the care they need. “Our job as nation is to make certain that when somebody is dealing with a mental health crisis, it doesn’t matter whether you have insurance or not, it doesn’t matter whether you have money or not, what matters is that you get the care when you need it.” He followed the same line on NBC, echoing an earlier discussion of his call as a democratic socialist for a “political revolution” by saying: “I believe what I would call commonsense gun reform plus a revolution in mental health … I think a vast majority of the American people can support an agenda composed of those features.” Sanders was also questioned about his vote in the House in 2005 for a law that protects, to some extent, gun manufacturers from liability over deaths from gun violence. The National Rifle Association – which does not grade Sanders highly – supported that law. It also funded a campaign against Sanders’ opponent in a 1990 House race that he won by 20 points. “That was a complicated vote and I’m willing to see changes in that provision,” Sanders said of the 2005 law. “Here’s the reason I voted the way I voted. If you are a gun shop owner in Vermont and you sell somebody a gun and that person flips out and then kills somebody, I don’t think it’s really fair to hold that person responsible, the gun shop owner. “On the other hand, where there is a problem is there is evidence that … gun manufacturers do know they’re selling a whole lot of guns in an area that really should not be buying that many guns … probably for criminal purposes. “So can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes.”"
http://theweek.com/articles/581697/what-bernie-sanders-gun-control-plan-reveals-about-power-political-parties,"Illustrated | Image courtesy Porter Gifford/Corbis Bernie Sanders, as you may know, is from the fine state of Vermont. Among Vermont's many notable features, in addition to green mountains, muddy roads, and an astonishing lack of non-white people, is an active hunting culture. So it is that even the most liberal Vermont politicians tend to be indulgent of guns. This got Howard Dean into some trouble in 2004 when people realized that the newly crowned champion of young liberal Democrats had for years gotten ""A"" ratings from the National Rifle Association — and in the wake of yet another mass shooting, it could become a 2016 problem for Sanders. It's a problem he's moving quickly to address. Sanders has a mixed history on guns — voting for some gun control measures and against others (there's a comprehensive roundup of his record here). Most notably, he voted against the Brady Act in 1993, and in 2005 supported a bill that gave gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits holding them liable for what people do with their products. But now he's about to put out a plan to address gun violence, which will lean heavily on measures that are supported by liberals and opposed by conservatives. So does this tell us that Bernie Sanders is a flip-flopping flip-flopper who voters can't trust, just like every other politician? No, it doesn't. What it tells us is that while parties may be less meaningful as institutions than they have been in decades (and perhaps ever), as an ideological force, parties wield tremendous power. The story of Sanders and gun control is about the transition from state to national politics, and about how presidential primaries create and enforce consensus on everyone, even those who, like Sanders, start out on one end of the intra-party ideological spectrum. To a striking degree, the primary process forces every candidate to be pretty much like every other candidate in his or her party. And that isn't a bad thing. That isn't to say presidential hopefuls can't disagree with the party's consensus at all, just that the differences have to be relatively small and confined to issues where there are multiple positions the average primary voter might find acceptable. For instance, Bernie Sanders can advocate free tuition for all public universities, while Hillary Clinton won't go quite that far. But the basic principle — that everyone should be able to go to college regardless of whether they can afford it — is one they share, even if Sanders is willing to endorse a more active government response to achieve that goal. On certain issues, however — one of which is guns — there is only one acceptable position for anyone in the party to have if they want to represent that party. There was a time in which a pro-choice Republican or a pro-life Democrat could at least contemplate running for president, but that time is passed (and there are precious few of either left). The gun issue has moved from the periphery to the center, particularly in the GOP; today being against any gun control legislation is as important to a Republican as advocating low taxes and small government. A couple of years ago you could be a Republican and advocate comprehensive immigration reform, like Marco Rubio did; today you'd have to disavow that and take a ""Secure the borders first!"" position, as Rubio has. (He's following in the footsteps of John McCain, who did exactly the same thing when he ran for president in 2008.) These kinds of shifts are sometimes produced by a genuine change of heart, but more often the politicians either realize that their party has shifted and move in response (as Democrats have on same-sex marriage), or realize they have presidential ambitions and they'd better get in line if they want to have a chance to win the nomination. When we see them do that, we often call them flip-floppers and assume not just that they have revealed a weakness of character, but that this weakness would make them a worse president. In truth though, a candidate who has flipped toward his party's consensus isn't going to flip back. Take Mitt Romney. He was the kind of moderate Republican he had to be to get elected in liberal Massachusetts. But when he ran for president, he became as staunch a conservative as anyone else. You can decide that his wholesale reinvention was cynical, but if he had become president, would he have said, ""Guess what, I'm a liberal after all! Eat it, suckers!""? Not on your life. He would have continued to represent his party. And it's polarization that keeps it that way. Prior to the 1960s, there were plenty of liberal northern Republicans and conservative southern Democrats, but the civil rights struggles sent the latter into the waiting arms of the GOP, while the former began to die off or become Democrats. And today, each party represents a clear, contrasting set of beliefs. Even inattentive voters at least have a chance of figuring out what the candidates stand for, without concern that the next president will turn out to be nothing like what they said they'd be. If nothing else, it ensures that when the next president gets elected, we know exactly what we'll get. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/02/4chan_and_the_oregon_shooter_what_the_suspicious_thread_says_about_a_horrifying_subculture_of_young_male_rage/,"It may have been a direct warning. It may have been just a coincidence. And regardless of which scenario is true, the fact we can't yet be sure should tell you plenty already about the horrifying subculture of murderously angry young men out there. As law enforcement and the press scrambled for information in the wake of Thursday's mass shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, which left ten people dead and seven wounded, Federal officials announced they were investigating a recent 4chan exchange that appeared to predict the rampage. In a cryptic post on the /r9k board on Wednesday, an anonymous poster with an image of Pepe the Frog holding a gun reportedly posted, ""Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning. so long space robots."" After the shooting, some users noted that a well-known figure on the board who goes by Eggman had in August posted a video declaring ""I'm done with r9k"" and on Wednesday had added another video saying, ""Anybody in the Seattle area, the Washington area, and want me to come, like, couch surf at their house or whatever, just hit me up dawg. I’m going to be here a few days."" Predictably, speculation soon ran rampant that Eggman was the shooter. But the killer was later identified as someone else — 26 year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Was Mercer the 4chan user who issued the warning? The timing is certainly eerie. But what's demoralizing is that it could easily have been the rambling of just one more loathsome 4chan troll in an ocean of loathsome 4chan trolls. The post was immediately greeted with a Christmas Eve level excitement — the first reply was, ""Is beta uprising finally going down? You might want to chillax and not alert police."" See, in the sad world of frustrated men who dwell in the lowest reaches of online community, males can divide themselves into ""alphas"" — self-aggrandizing, openly hostile followers of pick up artist culture, and betas, the poor misunderstood, passed over men who will have their glorious day of revenge. Does this talk of alphas and betas sound familiar? Maybe you remember getting the tutorial a year and a half ago, when another young man, Elliot Rodger, went on a deadly spree. Responding to the original poster, other users jumped in with helpful feedback. One person told him, ""I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun."" Another suggested, ""You might want to target a girls school which is safer because there are no beta males throwing themselves for their rescue. Do not use a shotgun. I would suggest a powerful assault rifle and a pistol or 2x pistols. Possibly the type of pistols who have 15+ ammo."" Someone else posted a photo of Elliot Rodger with the message, ""It takes a great man to do great things. Become Legendary."" Someone else, concerned, asked, ""You're only shooting college age students, correct? I have grandparents that live up there,"" while another person encouraged discretion, telling him to aim for the ""Chads and Stacies who have scorned many and yourself. You'll do the world a favor by purging part of the population that only exists to consume resources and act for themselves."" And one person posted hopefully, ""I am so excited for this. If this comes true then thank you for my late birthday gift anon."" Yes, some other participants chimed in to say, ""Nobody cares you're pathetic and this is why no one likes you,"" but the amount of enthusiastic support the post received is nauseating. And after the news of the shooting broke? ""HE DID IT ONE OF US ONE OF US."" ""You made us proud today, son. You made us proud."" One of the more rational comments came from the man who said,""Wanting to KILL EVERYONE (including yourself) is a symptom of having male emotions,"" because at least he added, ""Ya gotta get some distance mentally... but more importantly, you have to turn around and feel, just feel."" Not every frustrated male with mental health issues posting about how ""Our hero showed us the light and a reason to live"" is going to go out and do what Mercer did. What Rodger did. What Roof did. But it should be clear that guys like this are there, all the time, so full of fury at the world and the regular people living in it that they are delighted at the prospect of their deaths. And when it happens, they celebrate it. So maybe Chris Harper Mercer wasn't really in that 4chan thread on Wednesday. The sickening thing is, there are so many voices in it, just like his, how could you even tell?

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-donald-trump-takes-on-gun-control-mass-shootings/,"Watch CBSN Live By Sopan Deb October 3, 2015 / 7:42 PM
          / CBS News FRANKLIN, Tenn. -- As the seemingly endless debate on gun control rages in the country in the wake of yet another mass shooting, GOP front-runner Donald Trump took the stage in Franklin, Tennessee, on Saturday and made his thoughts clear in front of a raucous crowd. Trump said he was a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment and that any gun legislation that emerges as a result of mass shootings in the U.S. should be limited to addressing mental health. He went as far as to imply that if teachers were armed at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, where nine people were killed on Thursday, the campus ""would have been a hell of a lot better off."" ""The Second Amendment of our Constitution is clear,"" Trump said, reading from his second policy paper on gun rights. ""Every time something happens, they don't blame mental illness -- that our mental healthcare is out of whack and all of the other problems. And by the way, it was a gun-free zone. I will tell you -- if you had a couple of the teachers or somebody with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."" 2016 presidential candidates are handling the latest mass shooting under a familiar microscope - and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush may have stumbled in South Carolina. Trump criticized Bush for his ""stuff happens"" comment, where Bush was referring to how governments should respond to crises. On Friday, Bush said, ""I had this challenge as governor, 'cause we had -- look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" ""I thought it was a very bad word,"" Trump said. ""He used the words 'stuff happens' - I thought it was a very bad phrase to use. I actually was watching that and I thought, 'Wow -- he certainly has taken heat.' I thought it was certainly an inappropriate phrase."" However, later in the press conference, Trump expressed similar sentiments when asked how mass gun shootings could be stopped. ""No matter what you do you will always have problems,"" Trump said. ""That's why people are watching the news.  There's always going to be problems. There's always going to be horrible things happening. And that's not necessarily politically correct. There will be problems in the world - that's the way it is. I think we can make a big dent with mental health. If we can solve a big chunk of the mental health problem in this country, that would be so fantastic."" The speech also featured the color verbiage that his rallies have become synonymous with. When discussing foreign policy, Trump said Iraq had become the ""Harvard University for terrorists."" For the first time, Trump endorsed a safe zone in Syria for migrants but once again reiterated that they shouldn't be allowed in the United States. He went on to say the migrants could be a ""Trojan horse"" for ISIS. The latest Trump rally took place at The Factory at Franklin, which was built in 1929 for manufacturing. At one point, it made high-end mattresses and sofas before sitting dormant for seven years. It was eventually refurbished into a cultural touchstone, serving as the concert venue, theater and a vibrant farmer's market it is today. The rally was packed with supporters, as chants of ""America loves Trump!"" rang out from the audience of about 1,500. Hundreds more waited outside in the rain even though they couldn't get inside. Trump briefly addressed the overflow crowd afterwards to loud applause. ""Donald Trump is my hero so I'd do anything for Donald Trump,"" said 26-year-old firefighter Bradley Herring. Herring drove nearly ten hours from Raleigh, North Carolina to see Trump. ""He's a businessman, he's rich,"" Herring said. ""If he can build a billionaire empire, he can build a rich country. "" Before Trump took the stage, conservative stalwart Rep. Marsha Blackburn took the stage, making her the second high-profile elected official to speak at a Trump rally. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions briefly spoke at Trump's event in Mobile, Alabama. Blackburn railed against illegal immigration and Planned Parenthood before welcoming Trump to Tennessee. It was one of the more enthusiastic crowds of the Trump campaign. One supporter, Paulette Vee, who drove from Georgia, was wearing ""Vote for the DonDald"" buttons - yes that's the correct spelling. It was a button with Donald Duck on it. Richard Snowden, a 64-year-old retired former nightclub owner, road trips to as many Trump events as he can. He actually went all the way to Virginia Beach for a rally that was supposed to be held on Friday. Unfortunately for Snowden, a Tennessee native, it was canceled due to the approach of Hurricane Joaquin. ""We love Trump,"" said Snowden, putting his arms around his 12-year-old son Robbie. Robbie flew in from Buffalo just for the event. He was helping his father sell ""Make America Great"" visors to those waiting in line to get in. ""We like a non-politician,"" Snowden explained. ""I'm retired and I've been around politics since I was a boy his age. My first rally was Goldwater-Miller rally in Lockport, New York, in 1964. We love this. This is quite a phenomena. This is beautiful. We love it that he has the establishment in a tizzy. Don't we?"" Snowden turned to the line waiting in the cold and said, ""We love Trump, don't we?

http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Campus-carry-6587668.php,"Here's an interesting story we heard last week from the president of a Texas university who's having to implement the state's new law allowing firearms on campus: Attending a dinner a few years ago honoring a former Israeli prime minister, the president got to wondering what would happen if one of the numerous people milling about the room pulled a gun. Curiosity getting the best of him, he asked a member of the prime minister's security detail, who replied matter-of-factly, ""We'd put on our red caps."" Noting the president's perplexity, the guard reached into his suit-coat pocket and pulled out a red cap. ""If you're wearing one,"" he explained, ""then we know you're part of our security force."" The odds are a horrific incident like the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech or the shooting earlier this month at an Oregon community college won't happen, although, as the university president told us, you always have to be prepared for the possibility. If something did happen, though, the odds also are that gun-carrying students arriving at the scene wouldn't be wearing the equivalent of red caps. Campus security would have to decide within a split second whether the guy wielding the gun is the shooter or a would-be savior. That's the type of nightmarish scenario that keeps campus administrators and campus police up at night. Thanks to the Second Amendment zealots in the Texas Legislature who pushed through a campus-carry law this spring, they now have to cope with a new and disturbing element in the midst of an already stressful environment: guns that kill people - in dorms, in classrooms, in libraries, in proximity to high-excitement sporting events. Campus-carry advocates insist that guns will keep students safe from sexual assaults and other potential threats. They point out that only concealed-carry license-holders over age 21 will be able to carry guns onto a college campus. No doubt that's a very small number on a relatively small campus like Rice University, but it's a different story at a large institution like San Jacinto College, with many older students, as well as many high-school students on campus getting pre-college credit. It's a different story on an inner-city campus like Texas Southern University, which has experienced three shooting incidents and two fatalities in the past few weeks. William McRaven, chancellor of the University of Texas System, knows his firearms. A member of the Navy Seals who rose to the rank of admiral, he helped plan the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. ""I absolutely understand the Second Amendment,"" he told Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune recently. ""I have spent my life fighting for the Second Amendment. You know, you have to ask yourself why did the Founding Fathers put freedom of speech as the First Amendment? They may have done that because freedom of speech is incredibly important, and if you have guns on campus, I question whether or not that will somehow inhibit our freedom of speech."" Of course, those are practical concerns, and the gunsters in the Texas Legislature are not practical people. They're on a tireless mission, however impractical and inappropriate, to undermine common-sense gun curbs whenever and wherever they occur. Campus-carry is the law, as University of Houston Chancellor Renu Khator reminded us during a recent meeting with the Chronicle editorial board. She and McRaven and their counterparts around the state are now trying to determine how to implement the law in such a way that it assures the safety of everyone on campus when it takes effect on Aug. 1. Several private universities - including Austin College, Paul Quinn College, Trinity University, Rice University and TCU - are considering opting out of campus-carry entirely. Public colleges and universities are not allowed to opt out, but they can push back hard against the zealots who want guns everywhere, who are more interested in the presumed sanctity of the Second Amendment than they are in the real-life implications of guns on campus. Public colleges and universities can listen to the students, faculty and employees, most of whom are opposed to the new law, and do everything they can to accommodate their wishes. They can declare gun-free zones on campus. They can file suit if the gun zealots continue to push hard, as they no doubt will. The vast majority of Americans support common-sense gun laws. The vast majority don't want to see the proliferation of guns into every corner of our lives. But until politicians become more afraid of the votes of those who support common-sense gun laws than they are of the National Rifle Association, nothing is going to change. Voters have to mobilize. For now, there's no need for a run on red caps at Academy. We can hope that the impact of the new law will be minimal, just as we can hope that some day elected officials will focus their time and attention on issues that really matter to this great state. Pushing to proliferate guns is not one of them."
http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/an_open_invitation_to_the_nati.html," Gallery: Police investigate two scenes believed to be related to a shooting death of 22-year-old male in Flint This is an opinion of Flint Journal Editor Bryn Mickle. An Open Letter to the National Rifle Association Dear Wayne LaPierre, I would like to formally invite you to Flint to discuss the National Rifle Association's ideas for curbing gun violence in the city. Frustrated with the escalating number of gun deaths in our city, I am at a loss for answers. At first, I thought that expanded background checks were the answer. But your website, nraila.org, claims that people who go to prison for gun crimes typically get the guns through theft, the black market or friends and family. Nearly half the illegally trafficked guns came from people who can legally buy guns but then pass them on to those who cannot buy them legally, you claim. So, how about a gun registration that would allow us to track owners who can't safeguard their guns from theft or who are supplying firearms for crime? Turns out, the NRA doesn't like that idea either. Why? I'm not sure. Your website is kind of vague on that one, except to say that you don't like the idea of a gun registry. (Do you also oppose the Department of Motor of Vehicles? We register cars without too much hassle.) Why do you oppose a gun registry? Does your government scare gun owners that much? Do you really think anyone is coming for them? The NRA website claims that federal gun laws are strong enough. Guess what? You're wrong. The laws aren't strong enough. Not even close. Last week's mass shooting at an Oregon college is proof that the system isn't working. I know some of the guns-for-everyone crowd believes that tragedies like these would be prevented by the mythical ""good guy with a gun,"" but we both know that is just Hollywood fiction. I'd like to think there are a legion of Dirty Harrys out there waiting to spring into action, yet I fear the reality is closer to the Home Depot patron who opened fire on shoplifters in Auburn Hills this week. Even closer to home, the death toll continues to mount with each passing month. A few days after the Oregon shooting, Flint saw yet another death in what has become an all-too-familiar refrain of violence. At the rate we're going, we should hit 50 homicides by Halloween, which will at least give your friends in the gun industry assurance that their product is as popular as ever in Flint. I hate to break it to you, Mr. LaPierre, but contrary to your group's beliefs, we do have a gun problem. A big one. And I'm going to keep banging this drum until something happens. It drives some of our commenters crazy, but this issue is just too important to ignore. Racist claims that the problem is really just proof that liberal policies have failed mainly African American cities are bunk. It's a good dodge for the anti-gun-control crowd, but c'mon, Mr. LaPierra, we both know its just a sideshow. This is a real problem that deserves real solutions. Not paranoid ramblings of perceived government conspiracies to seize all the guns or blame-shifting explanations that pass the buck to the communities that are ravaged by these deaths. Guns don't kill people. People with guns kill people. So, please, Mr. LaPierre, stop pretending like there is not a problem and come help us fix it. We're running out of time -- and people.

        Andrew Kaczynski and 
      
        Mark Arce Posted on October 2, 2015, at 2:29 p.m. ET Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday criticized President Obama for the comments he made following the mass shooting in Oregon that left 10 people dead. ""Well, unfortunately that is the approach with President Obama on every issue, is that he seeks to tear us apart, he seeks to politicize it and it's worth remembering he is ideological and he's a radical,"" Cruz stated on the Mark Levin Show. ""You know, as his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel said, 'you never let a good crisis go to waste' and that sadly is his approach."" Speaking from the White House briefing room on Thursday, the president called the latest mass shooting at a small community college in Oregon ""a political choice"" that the country allows to happen again and again. The president, in comments directed at the gun lobby, added ""this is something we should politicize.""' Cruz said Obama would use the tragedy as excuse to take away guns from law-abiding Americans. ""We ought to first of all be lifting up in prayer the families of those who lost their loved ones today to this horrific crime, we still don't know the details of what exactly happened or what the motivations were, but what is clear is that every time we see a shooting of this kind, we've seen people with significant mental illnesses, with people who are violent criminals and there is no doubt that we ought to come down on violent criminals like a ton of bricks,"" said Cruz. ""We ought to do everything we can, for example, to be prosecuting the felons and fugitives who are trying to illegally buy guns. The Obama administration doesn't do that. Instead they try to use these tragedies as an excuse to come after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. It's unconstitutional, it's cynical, and it's wrong.""

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/06/donald-trumps-many-campaign-180s-in-his-own-words/?postshare=181457097827136&tid=ss_tw,"This article is more than 1 year old This post has been updated several times since it was originally written in October. Donald Trump flip-flopping is nothing new. The GOP presidential front-runner has a history of changing his stances, as NBC's Chuck Todd so pointedly noted back in July. (The Fix has also documented this.) But while many of those flips happened as Trump, over the years, transitioned from a Democrat to a Republican, they're also happening in the midst of his 2016 presidential campaign. In fact, he's made several total reversals within weeks or even days (or one day) of initially staking out a position. Often, his new position better aligns him with the conservative Republican base he's courting than his previous one. Trump's campaign flip-flops have been so conspicuous that in Thursday's Republican debate, Fox News moderators devoted several minutes to airing news clips laying out in plain sight just how frequently Trump has changed his mind these past few months. ""How is this telling it like it is?,"" moderator Megyn Kelly asked. Trump replied that he's flexible and can change his mind when presented with new evidence. That appears to have happened a lot lately. Here are seven of Donald Trump's biggest 180s so far, as explained by The Donald himself. 1. George W. Bush and Iraq At first he said: Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction In a Feb. 13 CBS debate, Trump was adamant the Bush administration purposefully misled the American people to get the United States to go to war with Iraq: ""They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew there were none."" 180: I don't know if he lied In an interview Feb. 19 on NBC's ""Today,"" Trump hedged on that allegation of the former president: ""I don't know if he lied or not. He could have lied. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. I guess you'd have to ask him."" 2. Afghanistan At first he said: Entering Afghanistan was ""a terrible mistake"" ""We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Oct. 06. He added: ""At some point, are they going to be there for the next 200 years? At some point what's going on? It's going to be a long time."" 180: I've never said it was a mistake ""Iraq was a disaster,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Oct. 20. ""Not Afghanistan, because that's probably where we should have gone in the first place."" When pressed by CNN's Alisyn Camerota on his change of position, he said: ""We made a mistake going into Iraq. I've never said we made a mistake going into Afghanistan."" 3. Syrian refugees At first, he said: ""You have to"" accept them ""I hate the concept of it,"" Trump told Fox News's Bill O'Reilly on Sept. 9, ""but on a humanitarian basis, you have to. ... ""There's no question about it. They're living in hell, and something has to be done."" 90 degrees: Focus more on our own problems A day later, Trump told CNN after a rally on Capitol Hill against President Obama's Iran nuclear deal that the United States should probably focus on its own problems here at home rather than accept so many refugees. ""I think we should help, but I think we should be very careful because frankly, we have very big problems,"" he said. ""We're not gonna have a country if we don't start getting smart."" 180: I will send them back Less than a month later, Trump told supporters at a campaign rally and said on Fox News that accepting the estimated 10,000 refugees President Obama has agreed to take could result in ""one of the greatest military coups of all times."" He suggested that the refugees would be terrorists who could strike the homeland from within and that he would send the refugees back if he became president. ""If I win, they're going back,"" he said. Days after a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.,  in December, which the FBI said was inspired by jihad, Trump went even further when he suggested a ""total"" ban on all Muslims entering the United States, ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" 4. Planned Parenthood At first, he said: ""Absolutely, they should be defunded"" Those were Trump's words to Blaze TV in July shortly after an anti-abortion group released videos of officials with the nonprofit women's health-care organization talking about what to do with aborted fetal tissue. (Planned Parenthood officials maintain they did nothing wrong.) In an Aug. 3 interview with conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, Trump reiterated that he supported conservatives even shutting down the government in a bid to cut off Planned Parenthood from some $500 million in public funds. 180: Keep it funded A week and a half later, Trump told CNN he opposes taxpayer dollars going to abortions but said he'd probably keep the money flowing to Planned Parenthood because of all the  ""good"" things the women's nonprofit health-care clinic does. His comment earned Trump headlines like this one below from the Daily Beast: Trump also repeatedly slammed former Florida governor Jeb Bush for saying ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health care."" 180 again: Defund it When asked in a Sept. 10 interview on ABC's ""The View"" if he'd cut off funds for Planned Parenthood, Trump said he would: ""I am against abortion ... and that is a tremendous amount of the work they do."" 90 degrees: Praise Planned Parenthood Trump hasn't changed his position to defund Planned Parenthood. But as he celebrated his seven-state win on Super Tuesday, Trump made sure to say something nice about the group. ""Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for many, many—for millions of women,"" he said, adding later ""I'm going to be really good for women, I’m going to be good for women’s health issues, it’s very important to me. Very important to me."" 5. Military spending At first, he said: ""I want to build up the military so nobody messes with us."" Days before the first Republican presidential primary debate in August, Trump answered critics who said he had no specific policies by saying he'd spend to rebuild the military to ""its height."" 180: Cut spending Almost exactly two months later, Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd  on Oct. 4 he still believes in a strong military -- but that he'd get there by cutting funding for it. ""We can do it for a lot less,"" he said. ""'I'm gonna build a military that's gonna be much stronger than it is right now,"" he said. ""It's gonna be so strong, nobody's gonna mess with us. But you know what? We can do it for a lot less."" 6. Going after the Islamic State At first, he said: ""I'm the most militaristic person there is."" To back up that statement, which he made in interviews with Fox News and CNN on Aug. 11 and 12, Trump noted he would ""send troops in"" to Iraq. He's also said he'd ""bomb the hell"" out of Islamic State-owned oil fields in Iraq to defeat the terrorist group and ""put boots on the ground"" in certain places. 180: Let Russia take over As the campaign went on, Trump started promoting a more non-interventionist policy in the Middle East (which more closely aligns with his general worldview). Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd on Oct. 18 that ""Everybody that's gone to the Middle East has had nothing but problems."" And he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Sept. 28 America should ""let Russia fight [the Islamic State],"" in Syria but added we could still fight them in Iraq. Trump declined to share details on how he'd differentiate between the two, summing up: ""Let them fight it out. Let Russia take care of [Islamic State]."" 7. Flat tax At first, he said: It's fair and simple ""You can have fair tax, you can have flat tax, you can take the existing plans that we have and simplify,"" Donald Trump told Fox News's Steve Doocy in an Aug. 24 interview. 180: Flat taxes don't work In that very same interview, Doocy asked Trump for specifics. Trump immediately started throwing doubt on whether a flat tax would work. “The one problem I have with the flat tax is that rich people are paying the same as people that are making very little money,"" he said before promoting some kind of ""graduation"" tax upward. As Mediate's Alex Griswold noted, taxing based on a scale is the opposite of a flat tax. When Trump introduced his tax plan in late September, it had no flat tax rate but rather a decline in income taxes for most Americans, as well as corporations.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/07/ben_carson_is_just_this_vile_5_repugnant_statement_hes_made_since_the_oregon_mass_shooting/,"Republican voters may be hungry for a Washington outsider, but being a political novice and running for president is proving to be a rather tricky undertaking for former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has found himself at the center of yet another storm of controversy over his comments on last week's deadly shooting rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. In a matter of days, Carson has seemingly blamed the victims for failing to jump the gunman, dismissed bullet-ridden dead bodies as simply the cost of freedom and called for the arming of kindergarten teachers. And it's only Wednesday: Carson said ""guns don't kill people"" During a visit to ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, Carson took on the typical conservative complaint that any mention of gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting is a ploy to ""politicize"" tragedy. “When do we have people that actually want to solve our problems, rather than just politicize everything?” Carson asked the hosts. “Guns don’t kill people,” he insisted, “and the Second Amendment is extremely important. And Daniel Webster said that America would never suffer tyranny because people are armed.” Carson has credited Webster for his newfound and ardent anti-gun control views. While Carson once supported the idea of banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition, he says he has since changed his mind. ""Reading people like Daniel Webster, who talked about tyranny in Europe and said it would never occur in America because the American people were armed,"" he told USA Today this week. ""When you look at tyranny and how it occurs, the pattern is so consistent: Get rid of the guns for the people first so you can go in and dominate them."" Carson wants kindergarten teachers to be armed Carson is out promoting his new book, ""A More Perfect Union,"" and has been stumbling left and right over the issue of guns all across the media. On Tuesday, Carson stopped by ABC's ""The View"" to take a grilling from the ladies. Co-host Joy Behar asked Carson about comments he made to USA Today's Susan Page earlier in the week. ""If I had a little kid in kindergarten somewhere I would feel much more comfortable if I knew on that campus there was a police officer or somebody who was trained with a weapon,"" Carson told Page. ""If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" ""If the gunman comes in with an AK-45, or AR-15, how fast can that teacher go to the locked drawer and get that gun?"" Behar followed-up on ""The View."" “Not all kindergarten teachers. I said people who are trained and understand all the implications,” Carson backtracked. “And you’re obviously not just going to have a weapon sitting on the kindergarten teacher’s desk. It would be secured in a place where kids could not get to it.” Carson said he'd rather see a body with bullet holes than see nationwide gun control ""As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies,"" Carson wrote in a Facebook question and answer session Monday evening. ""There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. Serious people seek serious solutions."" Carson said Obama should just wait for the ""next one"" instead of visiting with Umpqua victims Carson seemed disturbingly resigned to the constant national mourning over mass shootings in America we've been accustomed to when he told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade that he would skip a trip to the grief stricken town of Roseburg if he were president. There are reports that some residents will protest President Obama's upcoming visit because of his remarks on gun control. Would you still go? Would you still go if you were president?” Kimeade asked Carson. “I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I’d go to the next one,” Carson offered nonchalantly. Carson's vicious victim blaming: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me"" “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me, I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all,’” Carson said during that same Fox News interview. ""I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time. That way, we don't all wind up dead,"" Carson repeated again during an interview with ABC News while chuckling on Tuesday. But in an interview on the ""The Kelly File"" on Fox News Tuesday night, Carson tried to clean up his mess, explaining that he meant no offense to the shooting victims but just wanted to  ""plant the seed in people's minds"" that this is how they should behave when confronted by a gunman. ""If everybody attacks that gunman, he's not going to be able to kill everybody. But if you sit there and let him shoot you one-by-one, you're all going to be dead,"" Carson explained. ""And, you know, maybe these are things that people don't think about. It's certainly something that I would be thinking about."": This last line got Carson in so much trouble that even his biggest political rival had to jump in and defend him: Sophia Tesfaye is Salon's senior editor for news and politics, and resides in Washington, D.C.

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-steven-jones-northern-arizona-university-alleged-shooter-identified-police-say-2134649,"Steven Jones, an 18-year-old student at Northern Arizona University, has been identified as the shooter responsible for killing at least one person at the school's Flagstaff campus early Friday, police said. Jones was taken into custody shortly after the shooting. The early-morning shooting stemmed from a fight between two groups of students, Chief G.T. Fowler, of the university police force, announced during a press conference. Many details surrounding the ""confrontation"" were not immediately available, but Fowler said officers arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and took Jones into custody. Students are forbidden from carrying firearms on campus, Fowler said. The first call of shots fired came at 1:20 a.m. local time or 4:20 a.m. EDT. The shooting took place outside Mountain View Hall on the northeast end of the Flagstaff campus, which has about 20,000 students. At least one person was killed and three others were wounded. They are being treated at Flagstaff Medical Center, school officials said in a press release Friday. The identities of the victims have not yet been released. #NAUAlert: Details confirmed 4 victims, 1 fatality, 3 wounded. Shooter is in custody. Situation is stabilized. Campus not on lockdown.  This is the second shooting at a college campus this month. Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, gunned down nine people before killing himself at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, last week. Nine others were injured in the rampage, the New York Times reported. An investigation into a motive for the shooting is ongoing. U.S. President Barack Obama is traveling to the southern Oregon city Friday for closed-door visits with families of victims, a White House official told NBC News. Obama voiced his frustration with America's gun laws after the mass shooting last week and dozens of others already this year, saying these deadly events have somehow ""become routine."" He pointed the finger at the National Rifle Association and gun-rights advocates for blocking even ""modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon."" ""We've become numb to this,"" Obama said during a press conference at the White House Oct. 1."

Carson has been making the rounds of all the talk shows saying the way he would have handled the shooting if he was in one is to rush the gunman like some sort of zombie. Understandably, Americans started to give Carson some feedback on the idea of blaming the victims of a mass shooting and wondering how Carson could say such a thing, he's never been in that situation. But Carson totally understands what a mass shooting is like. He got held up once at ""Popeye's organization."" ""Not a Popeye's restaurant mind you, but a Popeye's organization,"" Noah laughed. ""It's a little known charity that gives out fried chicken in exchange for money... So Ben Carson was in a Popeye's Chicken, a guy pulls a gun on him, and Ben Carson says: 'don't shoot me, shoot the guy behind the counter.' This puts his perspective of mass shootings in a whole new light."" It is easy to say you're going to rush the gunman, but in practice, it is something else entirely. ""He said he would try to get everyone to rush the gunman,” Noah argued. “But I have a feeling it would be more like, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him.'"" Then backing away slowly while doing your signature raccoon hands move. The Daily Show even acquired footage of this incident at the Popeye's organization you'll want to see below. Noah then took on Murdoch's ridiculousness. First, he sympathized with what it's like to be young and crazy on twitter and craving fans. But Noah hopes when Ruppie is a little older he'll stop making mistakes like this. ""Now guys. It was late at night. Maybe the guy suffers from insomnia and the only thing that solves it is vaguely racist tweeting,"" Noah said. ""This is eye-opening, though. This whole time, conservatives have been accused of disliking Obama because he’s too black,"" Noah said. ""Now it turns out, the problem is that he isn’t black enough! Well, at least according to my ni**a Rupert Murdoch."" The Daily Show with Trevor Noah

https://mic.com/articles/126247/donald-trump-argues-guns-no-guns-it-doesn-t-matter-in-response-to-ucc-massacre," In the wake of this week's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, where nine victimsÂ died and seven were injured at the hands of a handgun-toting gunman, President Barack Obama urged the public to politicize the topic of mass shootings. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton demanded increased gun control, while Republican presidential candidateÂ and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush argued ""stuff happens"" and new laws aren't always the solution. Republican front-runner and real estate billionaire Donald Trump, however, just argued that not only will gun laws not preventÂ future shootings, but that mass shooters will accomplishÂ things ""people will not even believe are possible and that they are ""geniuses in a certain way."" In an interview with NBC'sÂ Meet the PressÂ that aired onÂ Sunday, Trump argued there is little that can be done to prevent future mass shootings and that ""guns, no guns âÂ it doesn't matter."" He added that ""they happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they're geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system."" ""I watched [President Obama's]Â statement, and I understand exactly what he's saying,"" Trump said. ""But, you know, no matter what you do âÂ guns, no guns âÂ it doesn't matter. You have people that are mentally ill, and they're going to come through the cracks."" ""And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible,"" he continued. ""And whether it's the school shootings which are really very prevalent in this country. They seem to be more prevalent in this country. And I'm not sure..."" ""What's your explanation?"" host Chuck Todd asked. ""They're just sick people,"" Trump responded. ""They're mentally imbalanced, and they probably see it happening here more."" Todd asked the front-runner if he thought there were more mentally ill people in the U.S. than elsewhere. ""I think what we have is, I think, we have copycats,"" Trump said. ""I think that they watch it and they see it here more than other places. And the world can be a pretty sick place in so many different ways."" ""But we have mentally, very unstable, people and that is going to lead âÂ and you know it's not politically correct to say,"" Trump concluded. ""You can have the best security. You have the best everything, but people are able to get in and do this âÂ just terrible damage."" Additionally, theÂ GuardianÂ reported that at a Nashville rally on Saturday, Trump invoked the 1974 Charles Bronson film Death Wish,Â in which a man whose wife is murdered and daughter is raped goes on a bloody rampage against New York City criminals. Trump told the crowd anyone who attacked him would be ""shocked"" to find him as prepared and well-armed as Bronson's character, adding, ""Today you can't make that movie because it's not politically correct."" Trump is currently leading the GOP pack in the polls, with the most recent Pew survey finding him at 25% support, followed by neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 16% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tied with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 8%. However,Â his support has dimmed somewhat in recent weeks, with one poll finding him just 1% above Carson.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/07/bernie_sanders_do_i_need_more_outreach_with_the_latino_and_african_american_community_absolutely/,"Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders appeared on ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on Tuesday to discuss the issues he believes next week's Democratic debate will focus on -- including gun control in the wake of the Umpqua Community College mass-shooting and his ability to reach minority voters. ""Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a lot of issues,"" Sanders said. ""We disagree on Wall Street and what we should do, whether or not we bring back Glass-Steagall or break up the large banks. We disagree about how high the minimum wage should go, I think it should go to 15 bucks an hour. We disagree about our college plans, I believe she hasn't come up with an opinion yet."" Sanders also spoke at length about his support for gun control, noting that ""I come from a state that has virtually no gun control at all. Yet, I’ve cast some very, very difficult votes in favor of strong gun control. I mean, you're looking at a guy who was a Congressman who voted for strong background checks, instant background checks -- I want to see them made even stronger."" However, he also proffered, unprompted, the preferred argument of anti-gun control conservatives, noting that ""in my view we need a revolution in mental health in this country. I believe you have thousands of people walking the streets of America today who are suicidal, who are homicidal."" Hayes asked Sanders how well he believed was doing ""building the multiracial coalition that is necessary to succeed in a Democratic primary past Iowa and New Hampshire,"" to which the Vermont senator replied that although he's now considered ""a serious candidate,"" his campaign does ""need to do more outreach to the Latino and African-American community."" ""One of the things that we are going to be able to do,"" he explained, ""because 650,000 people, a record-breaking number, have contributed to our campaign, is we are going to have the resources to develop a strong organization in South Carolina, Nevada, and the states that follow."" Sanders added that he has ""a strong record of standing up for African-American community -- but more importantly, we have an economic agenda, a social justice agenda, a criminal justice agenda which I think will make sense to the African-American community once they hear it.""

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/seth_meyers_mocks_gop_responses_to_oregon_shooting_jeb_bush_is_in_favor_of_pool_control_not_gun_control/,"Former ""Saturday Night Live"" Weekend Update news anchor Seth Meyers crushed Republican primary candidates for their cavalier disinterest over last week's mass shooting in Oregon. Monday night on his nightly show ""Late Night,"" Meyers addressed Jeb Bush's ""stuff happens"" by quoting the entirety of Bush's comments to clarify what Bush actually meant: ""So to be clear, he wasn't callously shrugging off the shooting, he was just that when tragedies like these occur it's important for the government to not do anything."" This is remarkably similar to many of his brother President George W. Bush's policies on domestic issues. Meyers showed Bush after the Conservative Leadership Project forum being questioned by the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza: ""No, it wasn’t a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong? Things happen all the time—things—is that better?"" Bush said defensively. ""I will say,"" Meyers said. ""When it comes to running a campaign, Jeb Bush isn't good at things or stuff."" Funny, because it's true. He went on to cite Bush's second attempt at a clarification, where he talked about fences around pools: ""A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools,"" Bush said. ""Well, it may not change it… the cumulative effect of this is in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people, burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder for people to protect liberty."" Meyers then cited a Florida law passed during the Bush administration and signed by Jeb in 2000 called the Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act which did actually require that a ""barrier must be placed around the perimeter of the pool."" This is awkward. ""So to clarify"" Meyers said, ""Jeb Bush is in favor of pool control, not gun control."" That's when Meyers completely crushed it with a kind of logic that could send Republican candidates spinning in bumbling circles of confusion: ""But this illustrates the point perfectly: We implement sensible regulations on potentially dangerous things like pools all the time. Why should guns be any different?"" Meyers asked. ""I know, I know. There's no 'Right to Bare Pools' in the the Constitution. But that's only because our Founding Fathers failed to see that a bunch of rich assholes would want cement ponds in their back yards."" He then moved on to attack Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, all of whom made similarly disconnected statements about the futility of regulations for guns. Meyers said, however, that the best illustration of hopelessness with the issue came from Chris Christie, who said yesterday that there is no correlation between tighter gun restrictions in New Jersey and low gun crimes. ""Christie actually disagrees that the laws in his own state have been successful in curbing gun violence,"" Meyers said. ""That's how backwards the politics of this issue are. Have you ever seen a politician decline to take credit for something good that happened in their state? That's like Kanye saying 'ya know I don't deserve this award, it was really the sound mixer...'"" Watch Seth Meyers crush Jeb Bush below:   Copyright © 2021 Salon.com, LLC.

Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  The Daily Show's Trevor Noah is pissed off at Ben Carson for blaming the victims of the Oregon shooting. On Tuesday, the Republican presidential candidate described on Fox News how he would handle a mass shooting: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Carson has doubled down on the comments since then, telling Fox News's Megyn Kelly, ""If you sit there and let him shoot you one by one, you're all going to be dead."" Noah was quick to point out that this sounds a lot like victim blaming. ""Let him shoot you? What do you mean, let him shoot you? What do you really expect the victims to do?"" He added, ""This guy would make the worst hostage negotiator ever. 'All right, sir, I need you to stay calm and put your gun down. Everyone else, rush him! Rush him now! How many people are dead? Well, at least it wasn't everyone.'"" Not only are Carson's comments offensive, but they misunderstand basic psychology. As Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver psychology professor, told the New Republic, blaming the victim in these situations misunderstands how people's brains work in times of crises. ""When you are in a life or death situation, sometimes your autonomic nervous system takes over and you may not behave the way you thought you would,"" she said. ""There are some factors that might make someone more likely to freeze versus run versus perhaps fight back, but it's not a real straightforward generalization that you can make."" That's why these imaginary heroic scenarios play out better in the movies, and when Carson's advice happens in real life, people tend to get hurt — exactly what happened in the Oregon shooting. Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  As the New York Times's Alan Rappeport reported, ""The heavily armed Oregon gunman killed nine people before taking his own life. The fact that an Army veteran who did try to stop him was shot multiple times and remains hospitalized underscores the risks of attacking an armed attacker, as numerous critics pointed out Tuesday."" This highlights another problem with Carson's comments: It took someone who has been trained for combat scenarios to try to act. Most other people are — justifiably — paralyzed by fear in these situations, and they don't have the training to overcome that fear. So expecting a large group of people to charge at the shooter is simply unrealistic, on top of coming off as victim blaming. So instead of suggesting that people attack shooters, a safer way to end gun violence may be preventing it from happening in the first place. ""I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away"" One way to do that is gun control: The US has more gun deaths than other developed nations because, according to the research, Americans have more guns, and more guns mean more gun deaths. So reducing the number of guns — by limiting access to them, or by immediately cutting the supply of them through, for example, buyback programs— would very likely lead to fewer gun deaths. But Carson is against gun control, writing on Monday, ""As a doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking — but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" Perhaps that explains Carson's comments: If he's unwilling to look at real solutions, fantasies are all he has left.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/16/hillary-clinton-calling-out-the-n-r-a-gets-a-quick-reply/?ref=politics&_r=0,"Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised to take on the National Rifle Association in aggressively pressing for gun control measures that have eluded the Obama administration. On Friday, the powerful lobbying group
                                                gave her a fight. It accused Mrs. Clinton of supporting “gun confiscation,” after she expressed interest in a gun buyback program that led to the elimination of the majority of Australia’s firearms. At a town hall-style event Friday in Keene, N.H., Mrs. Clinton was asked if she would consider the program, set up after a mass shooting, under which the Australian government bought back roughly 650,000 guns
                                                and then imposed stricter standards for gun purchases. “I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged,” Mrs. Clinton said. She compared the buyback, versions of which some communities in the United States
                                                already have adopted, to President Obama’s Car Allowance Rebate System (better known as “cash for clunkers”), which offered incentives for people to buy new cars and get energy-inefficient
                                                vehicles off the road. “I do not know enough details to tell you how we would do it, or how it would work,” Mrs. Clinton said. “But certainly your example is worth looking at.” In a statement, Chris Cox, the N.R.A.’s chief lobbyist, said that Mrs. Clinton’s comments validated the fears of gun owners and that her “extreme views are completely out of touch with the
                                                American people.” “The real goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation,” Mr. Cox said. “Hillary Clinton, echoing President Obama’s recent remarks on the same issue, made that very clear.” The N.R.A.’s response could benefit Mrs. Clinton as she seeks to emphasize her stance on gun control and highlight her differences on the issue with Senator Bernie Sanders, who voted against several gun
                                                control measures in Congress. At a campaign rally in San Antonio on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton, without mentioning Mr. Sanders by name, alluded to his comments during Tuesday night’s Democratic debate that “all the shouting in
                                                the world” would not keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them “and end this horrible violence.” “I’ve been told by some, quit talking about this, to quit shouting about this,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I will tell you right now, I will not be silenced and we will not be silenced —
                                                we must continue to speak out.” On Friday, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign released an online video that opens with footage of Mr. Obama’s news conference after the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon earlier this month. “This
                                                is something we should politicize,” Mr. Obama said. The 60-second video then cuts to Mrs. Clinton. “I will not be silenced,” she says. “I will keep taking on the N.R.A.” Mrs. Clinton’s gun control proposals, presented in detail days after the shooting in Oregon, included the use of executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole, should Congress fail to approve
                                                the measure. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Mrs. Clinton was asked about her newly assertive position, given that she had played up her gun rights credentials during her 2008 campaign. During that contentious primary, after Mr. Obama suggested at a closed-door fund-raiser in San Francisco that rural people “cling to guns or religion,” Mrs. Clinton told an Indiana crowd: “My
                                                dad taught me how to shoot behind our cottage. I have gone hunting.” (Mr. Obama responded by mocking Mrs. Clinton, saying she sounded like Annie Oakley, acting “like she’s on the duck
                                                blind every Sunday, packing a six-shooter.”) But Mrs. Clinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper that her stance on gun control had not changed. “I spent a lot of years in Arkansas. I have a lot of experience with and respect for people who own guns, collect guns, use them for hunting, use them for target shooting,” she said. “But
                                                I believe we have gone way too far in being intimidated by the N.R.A.” A version of this article appears in print on 10/18/2015, on page A18 of the NewYork edition with

http://theslot.jezebel.com/the-daily-show-thinks-ben-carson-might-be-a-zombie-1735386114,"Despite his weirdly somnolent voice and demeanor, presidential candidate Ben Carson managed to stir up some controversy this week with his opinions on gun control and dogged insistence that he’d know how to handle a mass shooter. Obviously, The Daily Show had some shit to say about that. Host Trevor Noah describes Carson as being “for people who like Donald Trump’s ideas, but hate his charm and charisma,” and also compares him to “drug-free cocaine for people who don’t want to get high but just like snorting white powder.” He also points out Carson’s tendency to laugh at socially inappropriate times, for instance right after reporters have asked him what he would do if he found himself in the middle of a mass shooting. Ha ha ha! Only a year and change to go until the 2016 presidential election! Contact the author at kelly@jezebel.com. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch says Ben Carson will be a “real black President.” You know, unlike the fake one we have now."

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/28/the-third-republican-debate-annotating-the-transcript/#annotations:8064963,"This article is more than 1 year old Wednesday night, 10 candidates participated in the third Republican debate: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former tech executive Carly Fiorina, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.). We've posted the transcript below, with insight from the crew here at The Fix as well as the Fact Checker's Michelle Lee. Click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript to see an annotation; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation. CNBC debate moderator Carl Quintanilla, along with CNBC's John Harwood and Becky Quick, introduced the candidates. (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: A lot to get to tonight. So let's get started. This first is an open question. This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, ""what's your biggest weakness?"" So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that you're a perfectionist... (LAUGHTER) ...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it? We'll go left to right. Governor Kasich, 30 seconds. KASICH: Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job. I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold. I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today. We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes... QUINTANILLA: Governor? KASICH: You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again. QUINTANILLA: Governor Huckabee. HUCKABEE: Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of. (LAUGHTER) But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of. If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules. And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by. QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. Governor Bush. BUSH: You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that. But also, I can't fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. It's never been that way in American politics before. BUSH: I can't do it. I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down. I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up. QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people. I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesn't have to be true. Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation. QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I'm too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said ""let up."" (LAUGHTER) QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson? CARSON: Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here. And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government. QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina? FIORINA: Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough. (LAUGHTER) QUINTANILLA: Fixed it. FIORINA: But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years. Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back. QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: I'm too agreeable, easy going. (LAUGHTER) You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I'm a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home. QUINTANILLA: Governor Christie? CHRISTIE: I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which. (LAUGHTER) But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world. But I know who the pessimist is. It's Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank. QUINTANILLA: Senator Paul? PAUL: You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money. I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt. QUINTANILLA: Thanks to all the candidates. John? HARWOOD: Mr. Trump, you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it. TRUMP: Right. HARWOOD: Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit. TRUMP: Right. HARWOOD: And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others. TRUMP: That's right. HARWOOD: Let's be honest. (LAUGHTER) Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign? TRUMP: No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that. Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in. As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally. And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That's 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000. TRUMP: We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders. And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance... Excuse me, John. ... of $50 billion... HARWOOD: We're at the 60 seconds. TRUMP: ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison. HARWOOD: We're at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like... (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Hold on, hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship. TRUMP: Right. Dynamically. HARWOOD: I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms. TRUMP: Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan. (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation says -- has looked at all of our plans and -- and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit... QUICK: Gentlemen -- we'll -- we'll get back to this -- just a minute -- just a minute we're gonna continue this. I wanna talk taxes... QUINTANILLA: Hold it. We'll cut it back to you in just a minute. Becky's moving on. QUICK: Dr. Carson, let's talk about taxes. You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and -- I've looked at it -- and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this. If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole. So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work? CARSON: Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy. QUICK: I -- I understand that, but if you -- if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28. CARSON: The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent. QUICK: 15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole. CARSON: You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places. Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world. So, also, we can stimulate the economy. That's gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations... QUICK: You'd have to cut -- you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole. CARSON: That's not true. QUICK: That is true, I looked at the numbers. CARSON: When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well. QUICK: Dr. Carson, thank you. KASICH: Listen, I want to just comment. HARWOOD: Governor Kasich, hold it, I'm coming to you right now. The... KASICH: Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy... HARWOOD: Well, I'm asking you about this. KASICH: This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning. HARWOOD: I'm about to ask you about this. That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from. Would you repeat it? KASICH: I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget. You can't do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt. I actually have a plan. I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic. You just don't make promises like this. Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. We'll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up? You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative. Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. We're up 347,000 jobs. When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left. That's was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing. Creativity. This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that. It's not responsible. HARWOOD: Well, let's just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues. Who were you talking about? KASICH: Well, I mean right here. To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that we're just going to be great? Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families? Folks, we've got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline. And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan. QUINTANILLA: Governor -- Governor. thank you, Governor. KASICH: And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you. QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds. TRUMP: First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number -- and that is important for you to know. Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened. And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner. And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got -- that is why he is on the end. (LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him. (CROSSTALK) KASICH: Let me just -- let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified. We're one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well. And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs. We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal... QUICK: Governor... KASICH: ... an agreement with the... (CROSSTALK) KASICH: ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. It's a joke. QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. QUICK: Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson... (CROSSTALK) CARSON: Since I was attacked too. QUICK: Thank you. CARSON: Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You're talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky. CRUZ: Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000. After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary. On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business. And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth. And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income. QUICK: Senator -- Senator, thank you. CRUZ: Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth. QUICK: Gentlemen, I'm sorry, we need to... (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: We're going to try to move on. (CROSSTALK) FIORINA: Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code. There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code. The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out. The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done. QUINTANILLA: You want to bring 70,000 pages to three? FIORINA: That's right, three pages. QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type? FIORINA: You know why three? QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type? FIORINA: No. You know why three? Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages. Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes. So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform -- QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina -- FIORINA: -- the issue is who is going to get it done. (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: We're going to -- QUICK: We're going to move on. QUINTANILLA: We will come around the bend, I promise. This one is for Senator Rubio. You've been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s. You've had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don't support anymore. Now, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president. Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start? RUBIO: That's an interesting question. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don't you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years. Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades. You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger. We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford. The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves. QUINTANILLA: So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you? RUBIO: Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today. QUINTANILLA: Well, do you hate your job? RUBIO: Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation -- QUINTANILLA: Is that the standard? RUBIO: Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement. (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John. BUSH: Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. He's a gifted politician. But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day. RUBIO: I get to respond, right? QUICK: Thirty seconds. RUBIO: Well, it's interesting. Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after? BUSH: He wasn't my senator. RUBIO: No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you. I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record. The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. BUSH: Well, I've been -- RUBIO: Here's the bottom line. (APPLAUSE) I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage. I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama. QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Senator. TRUMP: I think you're -- (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Hold on. I think there's a -- I've got question for -- (CROSSTALK) KASICH: John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here. HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. I've got a question for Governor Bush. (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: No, we're moving to Governor Bush. Governor, the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made. HARWOOD: You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you -- BUSH: No, no. What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now. HARWOOD: OK. BUSH: Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C. HARWOOD: Got it. BUSH: But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C. HARWOOD: But it's a -- OK. It's a -- it's a question about why you're having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context. Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race? BUSH: (inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future. They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on people's aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977. Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out. And you can go get it at jeb2016.com. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: We're gonna get down the line. Becky's got a question. QUICK: We'll get to everyone. Ms. Fiorina, I -- I'd like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you. Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously, you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market. I just wonder, in terms of all of that -- you know, we look back, your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now. FIORINA: You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company. It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row. As an outsider, I tackled H.P.'s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment. And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them. The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well. And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, ""you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C. QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because... (APPLAUSE) ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people. I think his quote was that, ""if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes."" Is this the type of person you want defending you? FIORINA: Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky. (LAUGHTER) Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is. So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions. And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable. Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account. I will run on my record all day long. (APPLAUSE) And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up... QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina. FIORINA: ...and be held accountable. QUICK: Thank you, we're out of time. Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Carl. QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz. Congressional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of -- another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you're not the kind of problem-solver American voters want? CRUZ: You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. (APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions -- ""Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"" ""Ben Carson, can you do math?"" ""John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?"" ""Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?"" ""Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?"" How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about? (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: (inaudible) do we get credit (inaudible)? CRUZ: And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet. CRUZ: The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, ""Which of you is more handsome and why?"" (LAUGHTER) And let me be clear. (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: So, this is a question about (inaudible), which you have 30 seconds left to answer, should you choose to do so. CRUZ: Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. (LAUGHTER) And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions... (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: OK. (inaudible) I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer. (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: You want me to answer that question? I'm happy to answer the question... (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question... (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question... (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Senator Paul, I've got a question for you on the same subject. CRUZ: ... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John? HARWOOD: Senator Paul? CRUZ: You don't want to hear the answer. You just want to... (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: You used your time on something else. Senator Paul? CRUZ: You're not interested in an answer. (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit. Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough? PAUL: No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. That's what they're doing. They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending. Here's the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms. HARWOOD: Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it? PAUL: Well, that's a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well, you know what I'm worried about? Not keeping the government open. I'm worried about bankrupting the American people. We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And that's what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute. (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator (inaudible). QUICK: Governor Christie, I'd like to (inaudible) a question next. Actually, I have a question for you (inaudible). In your tell it like it is campaign, you've said a lot of tough things. You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000. Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned. It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact? CHRISTIE: Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago. And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, that's with zero percent interest rates. Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes. Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from. And... QUICK: ...Governor... CHRISTIE: ...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it... QUICK: ...Thank you. QUINTANILLA: We promised we would get to everyone this block. Governor Huckabee, I'm going to give you 60 seconds on this. HUCKABEE: Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, we've stolen. Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare. But, you know what we're not telling them? It's their money. This isn't the governments money. This is not entitlement, it's not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, we're going to blame the people. Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, they're always going to say, ""Well, we're going to fix this one day."" No their not. It's like a 400 pound man saying, ""I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."" And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let's quit making it a problem for them. It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it... QUINTANILLA: ...Governor... HUCKABEE: ...No, sir... QUINTANILLA: ...Thank you, Governor... HUCKABEE: ...we need to honor our promises... (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: ...Senator Cruz... HUCKABEE: ...before I go. This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish. QUINTANILLA: OK, alright. HUCKABEE: ...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And, the fact is, none of them. (CROSSTALK) MALE: And, by the way, Carl... (APPLAUSE) HUCKABEE: And, the only way -- no... (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE: ...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth. It isn't there anymore, Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. It's not theirs anymore. The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago... HUCKABEE: ...Chris... CHRISTIE: So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth. For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true. QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz... HUCKABEE: ...Chris... QUINTANILLA: ...Before we go to break, we're clearly not having that beer you mentioned, but I'll give you 30 more seconds... CRUZ: ...Then I'll buy you a tequila... QUINTANILLA: OK. CRUZ: ...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies. QUINTANILLA: I'll give you 30 seconds to respond... (CHEERING) QUINTANILLA: (INAUDIBLE) HUCKABEE: Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond? QUINTANILLA: Respond on the debt limit, or an answer to the governor, which ever you choose. CRUZ: Well, sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems. And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look. I'm 44 years old. It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids. QUINTANILLA: 30 seconds, Governor Huckabee. HUCKABEE: John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away? HUCKABEE: Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country. (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: Governor, thank you. We will take a break. The Republican Presidential debate, live from Boulder, Colorado, coming back after a break on CNBC. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) QUICK: Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans. We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC. Folks, we'll get right back into this. Mr. Trump, let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies. Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times. In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this. You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did. But some of the individuals -- the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn't fare so well. Bankruptcy is a broken promise. Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now? TRUMP: Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit. Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest. But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful. Now hundreds of companies I've opened. I've used it three times, maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess I'm supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me. But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And I'm glad I did it. I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry. QUICK: Mr. Trump, thank you. TRUMP: Thank you. CRAMER: Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs. You have spent a lifetime in medicine. Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases? CARSON: Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market. Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else. So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on. The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem. CRAMER: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis. But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect. One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches. No one went to jail. As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars? CHRISTIE: You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department. It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It's a political Justice Department. And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law. And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already. We don't need newer (ph) laws. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government? So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life. CRAMER: Thank you, Governor Christie. HARWOOD: Jim, thanks. Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large. A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal. Still feel that way? BUSH: Well, the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth. And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country. We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income. HARWOOD: But to -- to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar... BUSH: You find me... HARWOOD: ...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it? BUSH: You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I'll talk to them. HARWOOD: So you don't want the coach to put you in any more? BUSH: Look, the -- the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up. You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss. (LAUGHTER) HARWOOD: Thank you, governor. Carl? QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea. Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree. Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field? FIORINA: You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades. What's crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it. So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business. You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back. The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying, ""we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet,"" is going to create massive problems. But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is what's going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage. It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. It's you see the health insurance companies getting together. It's why you see the banks consolidating. And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless. QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina. FIORINA: It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government. QUINTANILLA: OK. FIORINA: It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless. QUINTANILLA: Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) QUICK: Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that you've had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say? RUBIO: Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But I'm going to tell you the truth. Here's the truth. I didn't inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life. They didn't save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month. (LAUGHTER) I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard. We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family. We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did. But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about. This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about. QUICK: Senator, I understand all of that. I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too. But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't. You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that. RUBIO: And I used it to pay off my loans. And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book. (APPLAUSE) QUICK: But you -- but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed. That -- that was after you'd already come into that windfall. That's why I raised the question. RUBIO: Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan. It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing. We can't afford another four years of that. Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House. Thank you, senator. HARWOOD: Governor John Kasich, you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors. You call that corporate welfare. One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that's corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort -- jobs Ohio. If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas? KASICH: Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare. If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax. I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington. This is the same old stuff since I left. You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow. I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance. Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose. And you know what? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals... HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. KASICH: ... If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Thank you. QUICK: Yes, thank you John. Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn. And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause. But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes. I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause? CRUZ: Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling. The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits. You know, you look at women working. I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old. Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty. Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind. (CROSSTALK) FIORINA: Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women. FIORINA: 92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women -- QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina -- FIORINA: -- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies -- QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you. FIORINA: -- work better to lift everyone up, men and women. QUICK: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Carl? (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco's. Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits. Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality? CARSON: Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community. They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation. The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. And we need to make that very clear to everybody. (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: One more question. This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship. They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're involvement continued. Why? CARSON: Well, that's easy to answer. I didn't have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda. I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it's a good product. QUINTANILLA: To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder -- CARSON: If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission. QUINTANILLA: Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way. CARSON: No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those -- (AUDIENCE BOOS) See? They know. (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: Apparently. We will take a break. We'll be back in Boulder in just a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HARWOOD: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado. Senator Huckabee, I mean -- excuse me -- Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the heading, ""Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industry's savior."" It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants. But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans. Why is he wrong? RUBIO: Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again. The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. But here's the best solution of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here. But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad. HARWOOD: It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn't... (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement. HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator. Becky? QUICK: Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs. TRUMP: I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country and they're immediately sent out. I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley. QUICK: So you're in favor of... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: So I have nothing at all critical of him. ' QUICK: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff. I don't know where you... (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And if I could say just one thing. I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding. I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money. And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results. Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that? But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. SuperPacs are a disaster. They're a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could. (LAUGHTER) Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests. QUICK: You know, Mr. -- you know, Mr. Trump, if I may (inaudible). You've been -- you have been -- you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B. TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that. QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around? TRUMP: You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not... QUICK: My apologies. I'm sorry. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: ... he's really doing some bad... (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: Since I've been mentioned, can I respond? (CROSSTALK) QUICK: Yes, you can. RUBIO: OK. I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac. It's called the mainstream media who every single day... (APPLAUSE) ... and I'll tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, ""Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."" She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar... (APPLAUSE) But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media. QUICK: Senator Rubio, thank you very much. I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir. SANTELLI: Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve. You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency. Where do you want to take that? Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe? CRUZ: Well, Rick, it's a very important question. I have got deep concerns about the Fed. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation. The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity. And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. It's driving up stock prices. Wall Street is doing great. You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. But if you look at working men and women. If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent. She sees her cost of electricity going up. She sees her health insurance going up. And loose money is one of the major problems. We need sound money. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold. SANTELLI: Senator Paul, the same question to you. PAUL: Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed. I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us. I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality. Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society. What you need to do is free up interest rates. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money. SANTELLI: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you don't like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market. But you've also said that you're in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing. Isn't that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor? CARSON: Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have... ... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that? But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. Super PACs are a disaster. They're a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could. (LAUGHTER) Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests. (CROSSTALK) QUICK: You know, Mr. Trump, if I may... (CROSSTALK) QUICK: Just a minute, Ms. Fiorina, let me follow up on this for just a moment. You talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him ""Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator"" because he was in favor H- 1B... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that. QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around? TRUMP: He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not... QUICK: My apologies. I'm sorry... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Everybody is really doing some bad fact... RUBIO: Since I've been mentioned, can I respond? QUICK: Yes. Yes, you may. RUBIO: OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.

But you've also said that you're in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing. Isn't that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor? CARSON: Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have studied that issue in great detail. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are. And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now. And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services. That cost gets passed on to the people. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? It's poor people and middle class. Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class. And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich. Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it. SANTELLI: Thank you, Doctor. Becky? QUICK: Rick, thank you very much. Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality. You've said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis. Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality. HUCKABEE: I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. In fact, that's part of the problem. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government. I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it. That is our government today. We saw it in the blimp. (APPLAUSE) That's exactly what we saw. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth. And it's not the folks on Wall Street. I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers. QUICK: Governor? HUCKABEE: The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game... QUICK: Governor? HUCKABEE: ...is paid -- played fairly. QUICK: Thank you. Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky. QUICK: All right, Governor Huckabee. HUCKABEE: Let me just close it out this way. QUICK: How about 15 more seconds? HUCKABEE: We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight. Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, ""let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases... QUICK: Governor? HUCKABEE: ...""diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"" QUICK: Governor, I'm sorry... HUCKABEE: If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans. QUICK: Governor, thank you. HUCKABEE: Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that. Thank you. QUICK: Governor, thank you. Appreciate it. John? HARWOOD: Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent -- just like your plan does. But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent. Given the problems we've been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments? BUSH: Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all. Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now. The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise. The government has tried it their way. Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably. We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late. HARWOOD: Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you. The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale. Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward? RUBIO: No, that's -- you're wrong. In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them. Number one, you have people in this country that... HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation -- just to be clear, they said the... (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: ...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it. HARWOOD: No, I did not. RUBIO: You did. No, you did. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) HARWOOD: Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent. RUBIO: Well, you're talking about -- yeah. HARWOOD: And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent. RUBIO: Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money... HARWOOD: (inaudible) RUBIO: ...numerically, it's gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families. We are lowering taxes on small business. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. He's an S corporation. He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate. RUBIO: Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses. (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: ...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all. You know why? Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get. I want to be in -- I want America to be the best... PAUL: ...John... RUBIO: ...in the world for people... HARWOOD: Senator, thank you. PAUL: John, I'd like to address this? John, could I follow up on this? QUINTANILLA: ...We'll come back around. I want to get to governor Kasich. PAUL: What are the rules on who gets to follow up. How do we decide on who gets to follow up? I've seen plenty of other people follow up? QUICK: It's at the moderator discretion. QUINTANILLA: Governor Kasich, let's talk ... (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: ...about Marijuana, Governor Kasich... PAUL: I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion... QUINTANILLA: Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case. Sure, 30 seconds. PAUL: Alright. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut. If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut. Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election. QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. CRUZ: Let me say on that... QUINTANILLA: Oh, no, no, no... CRUZ: ...Rand is exactly right. His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, QUINTANILLA: ...Ok... CRUZ: ...eliminates the business... MALE: (INAUDIBLE) CRUZ: ...income tax... MALE: What are you doing? CRUZ: ...10% flat rate... QUINTANILLA: ...We're going to go to... CRUZ: ...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: OK. Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich, let's talk about marijuana. We're broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year. Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he's said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they're just now paying taxes. Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you'd like to have? KASICH: Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now. And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster. Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on. We could do a whole show on that. I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country. The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington. And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise. Again... (CROSSTALK) KASICH: ...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average. We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment. Folks, you want to -- QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. KASICH: -- fix America, this is the formula. It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio. Thank you. QUINTANILLA: Thank you. We'll be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment. (APPLAUSE) (BREAK) QUICK: Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC. Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas. I found where I read that before. It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says -- it says that again, Mark Zuckerburg's personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them? TRUMP: I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it anyway you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that. I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president. As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders. We have a country of laws. We have to obey the laws. It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally. QUICK: Thank you, sir. RUBIO: I was mentioned in the question. QUICK: You were. You get 30 seconds. RUBIO: Thank you. Well, I've learned the rules on this. (LAUGHTER) Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956. But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American. QUICK: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Carl? QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, you've said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York. TRUMP: Yes. QUINTANILLA: After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, ""By the way, it was a gun-free zone. If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."" TRUMP: Or somebody else. Right. QUINTANILLA: Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work? TRUMP: Yes, I might feel more comfortable. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER) QUINTANILLA: Are you carrying one now? (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership. (APPLAUSE) But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target. They look around for gun-free zones. You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long. I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage. So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They're a feeding frenzy for sick people. QUINTANILLA: We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that -- that do not allow guns with or without a permit. Would you change those policies? TRUMP: I would change them. I would change them. QUINTANILLA: OK. All right. Thank you. John? HARWOOD: Governor Huckabee, you've written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles. As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together. The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country? HUCKABEE: You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one, OK? (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) (UNKNOWN): Is it made in Mexico? HUCKABEE: I don't know. (UNKNOWN): Where's it made? Is it made in China? (UNKNOWN): Is it made in China or Mexico? HUCKABEE: I have no idea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor. HUCKABEE: You're welcome. (LAUGHTER) Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine. (APPLAUSE) You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year? I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an ""only guy"" -- ""I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."" Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them. Somebody says ""I'm a fighter."" Well, I want to know, did you win? Well, I did. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I think that ought to be worth something. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. CHRISTIE: John, I'll tell you something. You want to talk about moral authority. Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news. You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law. And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this. And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Does he stand up for law enforcement? No, he doesn't. I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people. This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States. That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Don't forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson. EPPERSON: Thank you, John. Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees. But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan. That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy. Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers? FIORINA: No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role. Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse. And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about. Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits. But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed. We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. How great is that? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others. The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare. They are refusing to... EPPERSON: So you wouldn't agree -- you wouldn't agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that? FIORINA: I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k). The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages... EPPERSON: Thank you very much. FIORINA: ... The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true... EPPERSON: Thank you, the rules say one minute. FIORINA: ... The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged. EPPERSON: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you. I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich. Most people can't get a college degree without going into debt. Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back. This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults. That's billion with a b. What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations? Well, first of all, in Ohio we're changing the whole system. Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or -- graduates or completes a course. Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. And let me give you an example. Universities today have so many non-academic assets. At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. They shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business. And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years. Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves. This is a big moral issue in America. Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice. And people can learn it through public service. EPPERSON: Thank you, thank you. BUSH: We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all. QUICK: Higher education is the example... BUSH: We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt. In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said. Let the states do this. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs. It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government. It is broke, it is not working. (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year. But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that's out of your control. Isn't that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such? BUSH: Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league. QUINTANILLA: I had a feeling you were going to brag about that. BUSH: Gronkowski is still going strong. I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week. So I'm doing great. But we're not gambling. And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation. Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all. And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation. If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit. And there should be some regulation. I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government. (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE: Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football? (LAUGHTER) We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. We have people out of work. We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. And we're talking about fantasy football? Can we stop? (APPLAUSE) CHRISTIE: How about this? How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families. Enough on fantasy football. Let people play, who cares? (CROSSTALK) QUICK: I want to go back, if I can, to the issue of... (CROSSTALK) QUICK: I want to go back, if I may, to the... HARWOOD: Governor Christie, you've said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: ""The question is, what do we do to deal with it?"". So what do we do? CHRISTIE: Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it. Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C. HARWOOD: What should we do? CHRISTIE: What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy. I've laid out... HARWOOD: You mean government? CHRISTIE: No, John. John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer? (LAUGHTER) How are we going to do this? (APPLAUSE) Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude. So... (LAUGHTER) We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy. I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey. Why? Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state. We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely. But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense. That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. (APPLAUSE) HARWOOD: Becky. QUICK: Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan. He warned that it would lead to socialism. Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it? PAUL: The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government? And what distributes goods better? It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job. Is there an area for a safety net? Can you have Medicare or Social Security? Yes. But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it. The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000. But the average person takes out about $350,000. We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families. When people ask me, whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money? And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids. (LAUGHTER) After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers. Now we're having smaller families. We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree. It's not working. I have a bill to fix Medicare. I've a bill to fix Social Security. For both of them you have to gradually raise the age. If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them. QUICK: Senator, thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Becky, may I... QUINTANILLA: This is the-- well, we're going to take a break. We want to save time for closing statements after the break. So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) QUICK: Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC. Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security. Your time, sir. HUCKABEE: Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this. And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis. And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didn't spend any. We've saved billions of dollars. You want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better. BUSH: Becky -- QUICK: Thank you, Governor. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: -- the governor's absolutely right. But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security. We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing. I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below. HARWOOD: Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don't have to be touched. Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, it's very simple. We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic. We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico. We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back. We're going to cut costs. We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare. (UNKNOWN): Governor, you just heard him. BUSH: You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income. And make sure you enhance savings in the private market. The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up. It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k). Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive. We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it. KASICH: John. BUSH: But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security. (UNKNOWN): Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds? KASICH: I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit. And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent? We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare. We can make a stronger program. But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy. You can't grow your way out of demographics. But we can give people better health care. And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving... QUICK: Governor. KASICH: ...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick? QUICK: Governor, thank you. Senator Paul, let's go back to you. Do these solutions sound like they work? PAUL: Say again? QUICK: Do these solutions sound like they would work? PAUL: You can't do nothing. And that's what I hear from some people, ""we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."" That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, ""something has to change,"" are missing the boat here. The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question. It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security. You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money. It isn't ""I put money in, I'm getting it back."" There is no money, it's a stack of paper. There is no money in the Social Security account. There is no money in the Medicare account. There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it. (CROSSTALK) (UNKNOWN): ...to deal with this. We did it 200 days ago. HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. I've got a question for -- for Dr. Carson. CARSON: About Medicare? HARWOOD: Yes. You've said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses. Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea. Explain how that would work, exactly. CARSON: Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out. But I think they will see a very good option here. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other. Divide that out. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program. And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, ""intellect,"" in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives? It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. This is a country that is of, for and by the people. QUICK: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Governor? CHRISTIE: And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem. And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem. What we know is we're living longer. That's a blessing. It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing. We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later? Or would you rather take less later on? QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio... HARWOOD: Governor, do you also think that... QUINTANILLA: ...yeah, I just wanted (inaudible). HARWOOD: ...that Dr. Carson's right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts? RUBIO: No. No. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas. They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them. But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate. You didn't see it for a minute. You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there. What you saw was a parade of, ""I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."" Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it. And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha. (CROSSTALK) QUINTANILLA: I want to give you 30 seconds here. RUBIO: I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing. And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue. The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates. The Democrats can't even come up with one. And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight. Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. I'm against anything that's bad for my mother. (LAUGHTER) So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable. And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us. FIORINA: John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here. I'd like to jump in. A lot of people have jumped in here. HARWOOD: Mrs. Fiorina, we're right at the end of our time. FIORINA: I understand. HARWOOD: You all wanted us to limit (inaudible). All right. Go ahead. FIORINA: I would just say that... (LAUGHTER) ... I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said. Every election we talk about this. Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform. It never happens. I would like to start with a basic. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. It's kind of basic. There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year. My point is this. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics. And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable. So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government. HARWOOD: We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece. We're going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul. PAUL: Liberty thrives when government is small. I want a government so small I can barely see it. I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper. I think, though, government is too big now. And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise. This is extraordinary. It's extraordinarily wrong. You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt. HARWOOD: Governor Christie? CHRISTIE: I want to talk to the folks at home. I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you? Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money? Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future? I've got one more question for you then. Are you serious about this election? Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture. I am deadly serious about changing this culture. I changed it in New Jersey. I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way. I'm prepared. I'm tested. I'm ready. And I want to make this our government. For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz? CRUZ: You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington. The natural next question is who actually has done so. Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party? When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight. If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America. Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom. HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator. Mrs. Fiorina? FIORINA: You know, every election we hear a lot of talk. We hear a lot of good plans. We hear actually a lot of good intentions. But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed. What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. That's how you go from secretary to CEO. You lead and you produce results. I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years. I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare. And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina. I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton. And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation. HARMAN: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Dr. Carson? CARSON: I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. And, this is what I am finding throughout America. People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness. (APPLAUSE) HARWOOD: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Our country doesn't win anymore. We used to win, we don't win anymore. We lose on trade. We lose with ISIS. We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran. We don't win. Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad. I went out and said, it's ridiculous. Nobody -- I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours. It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben. We called Ben, he was with me 100%. We called in, we said, that's it. We're not doing it. They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And, I'll do that with the country. We will make America great again. And, thank you everybody. Just for the record. HARWOOD: Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Senator Rubio? TRUMP: That's not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right. MALE: Thank you. HARWOOD: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: You know, America doesn't owe me anything. I have a debt to America I'll never repay. This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life. The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special. But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away. And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president. Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before. And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote. HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator. Governor Bush? BUSH: America's at a crossroads. The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse. I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida. I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee. I will do so in a way that will bring people together. We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do. Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again. Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again. I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Governor Huckabee. HUCKABEE: You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America. I've got five grandkids. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, ""Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. Good luck making something out of this mess."" And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. I know this, I certainly am. HARWOOD: Thank you... HUCKABEE: ...Thank you. HARWOOD: Governor Kasich? KASICH: I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, ""Can I still be idealistic?"" I said, absolutely, you can still change the world. And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world. Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem. We need to rebuild our families. We need to have stronger families. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. And God bless America. (APPLAUSE) HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. QUINTANILLA: That concludes tonight's debate. On behalf of my colleagues Becky Quick, John Harwood, Sharon Epperson, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, we'd like to our host, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Republican National Committee, the candidates and, of course, tonight's audience.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/08/its_so_much_worse_than_ben_carson_grotesque_pandering_to_gun_nuts_from_republicans_who_would_be_president/,"The latest mass shooting, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, is lingering in the public discourse a little longer than most shootings, which have sadly become everyday events in this country, do. Partially it's because of the body count, but partially it's because President Obama made a taboo-busting speech where he said, ""And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.  Well, this is something we should politicize."" Of course, Republicans generally politicize mass shootings while pretending to be above such things, using shootings as opportunities to assert support for our gun-crazed culture. But Obama's statement and Hillary Clinton's declared intent to make gun safety a priority issue has only ramped up pressure on Republicans running for president to assure the right wing base that they think it's absolutely ridiculous to think guns have anything to do with all these gun deaths. Here's where the candidates stand on the issue after this latest shooting. Ben Carson. Carson has had the most alarming run of grotesque pandering to gun nuts after the shooting, starting with blaming the victims for not being action heroes. ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson fantasized on Fox News. ""I would say: ‘Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me but he can’t get us all.'” In the same interview, he suggested the president can just skip visiting the family members of the victims, because there's always ""the next one"". He's not wrong that it's a regular event, but his wording certainly suggested that he doesn't really think of it as a big deal. His next appearance on Fox, on Tuesday night, confirmed this impression. ""“I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away,"" he told Megyn Kelly. If you think of ""devastating"" in terms of the political careers of Republicans instead of in terms of actual lives lost, you can sort of see where he's coming from. Donald Trump. Unsurprisingly, Trump has Ben Carson's view that the real world is indistinguishable from an action movie. ""Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Hey, if Daredevil can bicycle-kick a gun out of a bad man's hand, then why not those of us who aren't living in a superhero TV show? Jeb Bush. ""Look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis,"" Bush said right after the shooting. ""And the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do."" The comments offended a lot of people, but you have to admire his pithiness. He managed to get across the idea that mass murder is no big deal and that gun violence is no more controllable than the weather, all in a nice, tweetable sound bite. Rand Paul. Paul seems confused about the nature of guns, seeming to think that they exist to stop bullets, not fire them. ""The other common denominator, other than mental illness is that people are going to places where guns are prohibited,"" he told an Iowa talk show host. ""So when you have a gun-free zone at a school, it’s like an invitation, if you are crazy and want to shoot people, that’s where you go. I would do the opposite. I would have and encourage every school in American put stickers on every window going into the school saying, ‘We are armed. Come in at your own peril. We have concealed carry for teachers who have it and we also have armed security and you will be shot.’” The only way to stop kids from dying in a hail of bullets is to toss in a few more guns spraying bullets. With that kind of ironclad logic, you can see how our gun-saturated, shooting-happy culture got the way it is. Bobby Jindal. Jindal took his inspiration from the religious right, casting around for an excuse to blame sexual freedom for mass murder. In a blog post titled, ""We fill Our Culture With Garbage, And We Reap The Result"", Jindal blamed music that promotes ""the degradation of women"" and flaunts ""the laws of God and common decency"" (read: music videos that suggest that sex is fun). He also took a potshot at legal abortion, following the theme that letting women have sex somehow leads men to murder. But Jindal saved his angriest rant for the father of Chris Mercer, who committed the ultimate sin of suggesting guns have something to do with gun violence. ""He’s a complete failure as a father,"" Jindal ranted, because Mercer's parents are divorced. ""Because he failed to raise his son."" Of course, plenty of other Western cultures have legal abortion, women who have sex, and divorce, but don't have mass shootings like the U.S. But let's not let facts get in the way of a rant about how the decline of patriarchy is the reason for murder. Mike Huckabee. Huckabee made the same argument as Jindal, but with more Bible-thumping. ""We have not so much a gun problem, we have a problem with sin and evil,"" the former pastor argued, before going on to falsely argue that all mass shootings happen in a ""gun-free zone"". If Huckabee is right, then Western European countries that do not endure weekly mass shootings must be free of ""sin and evil"". Someone should ask him about that. John Kasich. “I don’t think gun control would solve this problem,” Kasich said at a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce event. “The deeper issue is alienation. The deeper issue is loneliness. The deeper issue is we’re paying no attention to an individual who is really struggling.” So countries like England, Canada, and Germany don't have loneliness or alienation, to go with their lack of legal abortion, divorce, sin, or evil? Must be, since they don't have a mass shooting problem like the United States. Marco Rubio.  Rubio invoked the mental health dodge, arguing that mental illness is ""a societal thing that we need to confront."" He does, at least, have a record of promoting mental health policies, though only in response to shootings. However, adding ""mental illness"" to the sin-evil-abortion-divorce-loneliness pile of causes doesn't explain why the U.S. is unique in having a problem for endless mass shootings. Ted Cruz. ""Well, unfortunately that is the approach with President Obama on every issue, is that he seeks to tear us apart, he seeks to politicize it,"" Cruz sneered, while hypocritically using the occasion to launch a divisive, politicizing attack. ""And it’s worth remembering he is ideological and he’s a radical,"" he continued, without noting that Obama's opinion is actually the mainstream of world opinion on this issue, and that Cruz's opinion is the one that falls well outside the norm. ""You know, as his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel said, ‘you never let a good crisis go to waste’ and that sadly is his approach,"" he added, making sure not to let this opportunity to bag on Obama go to waste. Carly Fiorina. For someone who likes to get wild with the rhetoric, Fiorina's entrance into this competition of who can be the most callous after a shooting is rather weak. ""Before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have,"" she said in response to Obama's speech. The comment did feature her trademark allergy to the truth---the guns used for this murder were purchased legally and all applicable laws were, in fact, followed---but overall, not the most attention-grabbing comments for a contest where the loudest mouth demagogue is generally the most popular. Looking over the field of candidate responses to this, the Republican strategy on guns has become quite clear: Minimize the violence and find anyone or anything else---including the victims themselves---to blame instead of our country's failed gun policies.

https://mic.com/articles/126595/fox-news-just-took-ben-carson-s-holocaust-comment-to-a-horrifying-new-level," Republican presidential candidate and famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson amped up the gun rights rhetoric this week by saying if German civilians were better armed, Adolf Hitler's chances to pull off genocide ""would have been greatly diminished."" Now, a Carson booster and regular Fox News contributor has taken Carson's views even further, defending him in a Friday op-ed with a troubling outlook on the victims of the Holocaust. Fox News' Keith Ablow's column is titled ""Why Ben Carson Is Right About Jews, the Holocaust and Guns."" There's not much reading to do between the lines. Ablow's piece is vile, portraying the Jewish population in Europe as passive at best and complicit in their own destruction at worst. In aÂ three-paragraph section of the column, Ablow misunderstands the nature of the Holocaust, discusses how Jews failed to learn the lessons of the Old Testament and argues the Nazis would have murdered fewer people had they just stood up for themselves with firearms.Â Ablow is basically arguing gun rights would have prevented the Holocaust, but he doesn't stop there. He insinuates Hitler's victims lacked courage.Â Here's a memo to Ablow: The Jewish people of Europe did resist, often with the same ferocity he seems to think they lacked. The United States Holocaust Memorial MuseumÂ has on record over 100Â separate armed rebellions by residents of occupied territories in Poland and the Soviet Union, where Jewish resistance members often fought to the last. In almost every occasion, the survivors were liquidated. During the famous Warsaw 1943 uprising, a thousand or more Jews in the occupied city of Warsaw who had been forced into a decrepit ghetto rose up against Gestapo, Wehrmacht and Waffen-S.S. troops and put up incredible resistance for nearly a month. Survivor Marek Edelman describes the resistanceÂ beginning despite ""the terror of what was happening and by fear of large-scale retaliations on the part of the Germans ...Â the events began moving at a breath-taking pace. The ghetto streets became a bloody slaughterhouse. The Germans made it a habit to shoot passers-by without the slightest provocation."" Contact with the outside world was almost completely cut off, and the systematic murder of all inhabitants begun. Edelman writes the Germans set up blockades to cut the inhabitants off from one another and focused their power on one block at a time, clearing houses and shooting everyone who remained. When the uprising began, the resistance was so ferocious that the Germans attempted to negotiate. The partisans shot the negotiators. ""From balconies, windows, and rooftops they showered the moving truckloads of S.S.-men with hand grenades and with rifle and pistol fire,"" Edelman recalls. In response, the Germans burnt entire districts of the Ghetto to the ground. Jewish partisans ""descended to the underground shelters occupied by the civilian population to defend whatever could still be defended."" ""Whoever survived the German bullets, whoever was not gassed, committed suicide, for it was quite clear that from here there was no way out, and nobody even considered being taken alive by the Germans,"" Edelman writes. ""Jurek Wilner called upon all partisans to commit suicide together. Lutek Rotblat shot his mother, his sister, then himself. Ruth fired at herself seven times."" Similar uprisings against German authorities occurred even in the death camps where many of the estimated 6 million Jewish peopleÂ who died during the Holocaust were killed. One uprising at the Treblinka facility resulted in 300 escapes. Ablow's politicizing the Holocaust:Â The unfortunate reality is German forces enjoyed overwhelming superiority of arms over civilians in territories under their control. Access to firearms would have made little difference. But instead of marching helplessly to their doom, Jews all across Europe fought back despite overwhelming odds. Millions of others escaped into safer territory. Ablow is insulting their memory as well as those of those marched by force into death camps. The reception to his column on Twitter was nearly universally negative. Carson himself is partly to blame for this, since it's exactly the debate he opened with his original commentsÂ on the Holocaust and gun rights. (The candidate has also spent the last week doubling down on his statements he wouldn't just stand there and get shot during a mass shooting.) But Carson is simultaneously enjoying a surge in the polls that has carried him to second place in the Republican primary contest, with Real Clear PoliticsÂ ranking him behind billionaire real-estate mogul Donald Trump with the support of 17.2% of the Republican primary electorate. The first few months of the primary election have demonstrated offensive views won't necessarily sink a candidacy, and it should concern anyone that prominent candidates are flirting with such ugly rhetoric. Oct.Â 10, 2015:Â This story has been updated to clarify the electorate that supports Ben Carson."
http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/10_things_to_watch_for_at_the_democratic_debate.html#incart_river," Gallery: 2016 Democratic presidential candidates WASHINGTON -- The Democratic presidential candidates meet Tuesday in Las Vegas for their first of six debates. Here are 10 things to watch for: 1. Hillary Clinton may have to play defense. Clinton holds a double-digit lead in national opinion polls for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Her rivals can articulate policies to contrast themselves with the Democratic front-runner to drive their poll numbers up, or go on the attack to drive her poll numbers down. In a CBS News poll released Sunday, she led U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont among likely Democratic primary voters, 46 percent to 27 percent. In August, she held a 58 percent to 17 percent lead. RELATED: 5 things you may not know about Hillary Clinton's relationship with N.J. 2. Clinton can expect questions on the e-mail controversy. Concerns over her decision to use a private e-mail server while U.S. secretary of state has contributed to Clinton's recent problems. In the CBS News poll, just 21 percent of registered voters said that using the private server was appropriate, compared with 71 percent who said it was inappropriate, and half said it would a factor in their vote. Clinton has tried to dismiss the issue as nothing more than a political attack, citing House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) crediting the House Republican special committee on Benghazi with bringing down her poll numbers. 3. Bernie Sanders tries to solidify his status as the Clinton alternative. The Vermont senator, who caucuses with Senate Democrats though he was elected as a Socialist, is raising big money, drawing big crowds, and rising in polls. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College survey released earlier this month gave Sanders a 48 percent to 39 percent lead in New Hampshire, the first primary state. Clinton led Sanders, 47 percent to 36 percent, in Iowa, the first caucus state. No one else had more than 4 percent in either state. 4. Expect questions on the economy and Syria. Obamacare, not so much. Expect questions about the economy; foreign policy, especially Syria and the Islamic State; and perhaps gun control. Not on the list: defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing the Affordable Care Act. 5. Candidates criticize President Obama at their own peril. Clinton served in the Obama administration, so criticizing the president could be a two-fer for the other Democratic hopefuls. At the same time, 83 percent of Democrats supported Obama's performance in office in the latest CBS News poll, even as his overall job approval ratings remain in negative territory. 6. It's important to avoid gaffes. In the final Democratic debate before the 2008 New Hampshire primary, Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York, was asked her response to voters feeling that Obama was more likable than she was. ""Well, that hurts my feelings,"" she said to laughter. She went on: ""He's very likable. I agree with that. I don't think I'm that bad."" Obama then interjected: ""You're likable enough, Hillary."" Clinton rode the backlash to Obama's comment to victory in the primary, though would up losing the nomination. 7. The mass shooting in Oregon could give O'Malley a platform. The killing of nine people at an Oregon community college Oct. 1 spurred new calls by Democratic members of Congress for legislation to make it harder for those bent on mass murder to buy weapons. As governor of Maryland, O'Malley responded to the 2012 killing of 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Conn., by pushing through legislation to increase licensing requirements for handguns, ban assault weapons, and limit the capacity of magazines. 8. Donald Trump could be a topic in this debate too. The billionaire businessman is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and the Real Clear Politics average of polls taken since Aug. 26 puts him within 3.4 percentage points of Clinton in a general election matchup. 9. Like Carly Fiorina did in the GOP debate, a Democrat could break out of the pack. The former Hewlett-Packard chief executive shone at the warm-up debate in August and turned her rave reviews into big gains in opinion polls, allowing her to sit on the main stage in the second Republican presidential debate in September. She was declared a winner of that debate as well, despite insisting that heavily edited Planned Parenthood videos recorded by an anti-abortion group included a scene that didn't exist. 10. Joe Biden will be tuning in. The vice president reportedly is considering a late entry into the presidential race. But strong performances by Clinton and the others may show him that there is no room for another candidate. Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/02/chicago_uber_alles_fox_news_directive_from_on_high_if_obama_discusses_mass_shooting_you_mention_the_second_city/,"On both ""The Kelly File"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" the response to the President Barack Obama's remarks about the mass-shooting at Umpqua Community College was the same -- he isn't allowed to discuss gun deaths until he solves the gang wars in his adopted home city of Chicago. ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together,"" a visibly frustrated Obama said on Wednesday. ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" But the part of the president's speech which gave the greatest offense to those at Fox News was his claim that ""we know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths, so the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence."" On ""The Kelly File,"" guest Dana Loesch said that ""he comes from Chicago, so I find that a little hard to believe he's stating that. Illinois has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. You basically can't even drive through Illinois without having your ammunition and firearms stored in a certain way."" Loesch failed to mention that those regulations are in place because residents of Illinois purchase and then transport their firearms and ammunition from neighboring states with more lax gun control laws. That would suggest that federal gun control legislation would be an effective way to curb gun violence, but that's decidedly not the point Loesch wants to make. ""There are a lot of Roseburgs that happen every single weekend in Chicago,"" was the point Loesch wanted to, and did, make -- sans the discussion of neighboring states, of course. On ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" host Bill O'Reilly said ""I don't have a script here, I'm just talking to President Obama right now, me to him,"" and then proceeded to make the exact same argument Loesch did. Without a script, though, because he's speaking off-the-cuff, and directly to the president. Just a coincidence it's an identical argument. ""Your home state of Illinois has the most stringent gun laws in the country,"" he said, ""and Chicago is the largest city in Illinois. Since 2012, there have 1,679 murders, many of them exactly where you worked as a community organizer."" ""You know that Chicago has extremely stringent gun laws,"" O'Reilly added, of course neglecting to mention the fact that states neighboring Illinois don't. Because what would be the point in that? O'Reilly has all these dead bodies and a possible Christian persecution angle to exploit, and mentioning simple facts about interstate commerce won't help him transform these victims of gun violence into ratings gold.

http://ew.com/article/2015/10/05/john-oliver-mental-health-oregon-shooting/,"On Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver slammed Republican presidential nominee hopefuls Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee for citing mental health issues in response to last week’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college. “There’s nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health,” Oliver said during a segment on America’s dysfunctional mental health policies. “The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health. Because, for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people.” Citing historical facts and figures, and current stats (prisons, for instance, are the largest provider of mental health care in the U.S.), Oliver detailed the systemic flaws with America’s treatment of the mentally ill. And according to the host, only bringing up mental health in relation to mass shootings “is deeply misleading.” “If we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a f—ing plan,” Oliver said.

Activists and Democrats attribute the shift to a hard-charging president, a powerful new infrastructure of gun control advocates, and a handful of gubernatorial victories — all of which have helped to end Democratic caution about guns. By
      
        Evan McMorris-Santoro Posted on October 7, 2015, at 9:12 a.m. ET WASHINGTON — Just a few hours after a gunman shot and killed two Virginia TV reporters live on air Aug. 26, while the details of the shooting were still a confusing mess, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took to Twitter. Heartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, started talking about gun control and a political solution to the Virginia deaths. She had talked about it before then, and since then, she's unveiled a set of gun control measures. President Obama expressly promised to ""politicize"" the Oregon deaths in his first remarks following the murders last week, the latest in a series of emotional speeches he's delivered after mass shootings. These days, they’re just the two most prominent Democrats of the many elected officials willing to talk about gun control early and often. This is the sound of the new gun control political safety net working, say advocates and Democratic political strategists. That Democrats move instantly to politicize shootings — and invite the sustained criticism of gun rights supporters, who view the move as callous at best and calculated at worst, for doing it — is now an expected part of the national debate. Not too long ago, it really wasn’t. Democrats might say they’d be interested in exploring gun control if asked about it, or start any conversation about gun control by talking about their own firearms collections, or say that the untenable politics made the idea unrealistic. It wasn’t something Democrats generally brought up on their own and it wasn’t a topic they were especially interested in dwelling on. Over the last few years, advocates and activists have worked hard behind the scenes to show politicians likely to support new gun laws that politicizing won’t hurt them and that the gun industry lobby isn’t as powerful as they thought. Groups like Americans for Responsible Solutions, founded by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, a mass shooting victim, and her husband, Mark Kelley, and Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, are regularly meeting with top staff in Democratic circles to discuss messaging strategy, and trying to prove the gun lobby can be beaten by funding state-level political action and touting it to national party strategists. Those efforts, President Obama’s personal commitment to the cause, and the victories of a handful of Democratic governors who’ve run on gun control messages have gone a long way in changing the Democratic conversation. “People have some air cover now,” said a senior Democrat in the orbit of Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who won re-election in 2014 after championing a slew of gun control laws after Newtown. The National Rifle Association targeted Malloy — as well as Colorado Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who also supported and signed new gun laws — but both men won their elections in a dark year for Democrats. Smarter, more powerful gun control advocates helped, said the Malloy source. “There’s an additional savvy to them,” the source said, referring to the new gun control advocates at Americans for Responsible Solutions and Everytown. “They’ve got good methodologies, good polling, good tactics, and they’ve got money. That was something the NRA had institutionalized.” Obama turned Democrats back to gun control with his forceful but ultimately unsuccessful push for it after Newtown in early 2013; Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe won as a gun control Democrat in a purple state in late 2013. Observers in Democratic politics and the gun control community argue both events helped make the party comfortable with making shootings political once again. McAuliffe’s good friend, former president Bill Clinton, once signed the 1994 crime bill that in Democratic mythology helped cost the party the Congress in Bill Clinton’s first midterm elections thanks to its gun control provisions and subsequent NRA backlash. When Obama steered the party back toward gun control in January 2013, the first real Democratic efforts in the area since that bill, Bill Clinton urged caution in meetings with Obama supporters. By early 2014, Bill Clinton was headlining an Americans for Responsible Solutions fundraiser in New York City and giving advice on Democrats can do more to pass restrictions on gun purchases. In between came McAuliffe’s election. Running for governor in the state that’s home to NRA headquarters, McAuliffe promised expanded background checks and a return to the state’s defunct one-handgun-per-month purchase limit. He celebrated his low grades from the gun lobby and bet that voters for whom gun control is on the list of policy priorities would outvote the single-issue firearms voters gun rights groups like the NRA had successfully turned out for years. McAuliffe won his election. Clinton campaigns with McAuliffe in 2013. According to an attendee who related the story to BuzzFeed News last week, Bill Clinton held an impromptu strategy session with Americans for Responsible Solutions leadership on his way out the door from the New York City event, poking one senior member of the group’s leadership in the chest to emphasize the point that McAuliffe had changed the game. McAuliffe took on the NRA, but focused on “access” issues like background checks rather than demonizing gun ownership, Bill Clinton said, according to the source. The next election cycle, 2014, was terrible for Democrats. But the wins by Hickenlooper and Malloy, as well as various state, legislative, and other victories by gun control advocates resonated, they said, and the groups scrambled to make sure gun control wasn’t blamed for 2014 the way it was for 1994. (The examples may not be perfect — Malloy governs a blue state, for instance.) Shortly after the election, Americans for Responsible Solutions staff met with senior officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) to show them how to use microtargeting to find voters open to a gun control message without turning a whole election in a tough state into a referendum on gun control, according to a person who attended the sessions. A DCCC spokesperson confirmed committee staff have met with representatives for Americans For Responsible Solutions as well as those from Everytown. The DSCC did not respond to a request for comment. Fear among advocates that Democrats might go weak on gun control after sticking their necks out on it in 2013 was part of the reason for the meetings, the attendee said, but advocates would have reached out even if things had been “rosy” for Democrats. The goal was to share the knowledge about modern gun control campaigning with the party most likely to be interested in it in future elections. Gun control advocates — or “gun safety advocates,” as they prefer to be called — said they still faced a lot of cautious politicians, especially Democrats. But the partisan lines around the issue are also changing with the help of the new gun control advocacy, they said. “Washington is certainly a town of political calculation, but as the strength of our community has grown, it’s become something that our elected leaders can’t ignore,” Hayley Zachary, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, told BuzzFeed News. She said her talks with politicians sometimes still result in “antiquated responses” to the politics of the guns, but that looking away from Washington has helped her make the point that pushing for expanded background checks and other measures isn’t the political risk it once was. “We have found Republicans and Democrats who are willing to meet with us,” Zachary said. Groups have touted successes in winning over Republican lawmakers on the state level, and they note the 2013 Senate bill pushed by the White House had bipartisan backing. The politics are shifting, even if the players in the gun control debate aren’t really, she said. What political leaders want is to know that they’ll be supported if they vote for gun control — and that the voters who will back them after the vote can be found and pulled out. They want the same help from gun control supporters opponents have had for decades. “There is definitely a history of political involvement on this issue from the gun lobby,” Zachary said. “We are up against them more than we are against a political party.” Millions of dollars are flowing in support of gun control now, and the politicians that take risks have backup they didn’t used to. “There’s nothing like a scorecard,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown. “We’re out there; everybody knows we’re out there. Thirty-six states in this last legislative session. And, winning. Beating the gun lobby... That speaks 1,000 words.” National politicians, especially Democrats, are open to talking about gun control even as gun rights advocates continue to control the Washington debate, making national legislation practically impossible. Howard Wolfson, a former top Bloomberg and adviser who helped oversee the billionaire former mayor’s super PAC spending in 2012 and 2014, said even small state-level wins reverberate. “Politics in D.C. is stuck on a gridlocked partisan loop on nearly every every issue,” he told BuzzFeed News in an email, “but in the states we are having real success — and people are noticing.” The NRA has certainly noticed. The group has been running ads aimed at tearing down a nonexistent Bloomberg presidential candidacy since August. The impact on Democrats of a consistent gun control push from the White House and a support system to back it up on the trail is clear. But gun politics are still some of the toughest politics around: While polls routinely show huge majorities of Americans favor stricter federal background checks and tighter regulations on gun purchases, 2016 will be the first test in a long time of how willing they are to vote against politicians who continue to block background check expansion. Gun rights advocates have shown they’re still willing and able to punish lawmakers who cross them, or at least convince them that the politically beneficial path after a mass shooting still steers them well clear of new gun laws that, the gun rights advocates often point out, might have done little to prevent the event in question. Democrats who have stared down the NRA and found an infrastructure to back them up say the feeling is liberating. “You can vote your conscience here and that’s something you couldn’t say five years ago,” the Malloy insider said. “The most interesting contrast is between 2008 and 2016,” said Feinblatt, president of Everytown. “Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were not debating gun issues in 2008. I’d argue they were doing just the opposite because they had really accepted the notion that no matter how you felt about it in your heart, it wasn’t worth the political risk of talking about it.” Seven years later, Feinblatt said, there’s been a “sea change” in Democratic presidential politics. “Clinton is talking about it and she’s talking about it everywhere, not selectively,” he said. “And Bernie Sanders is actually trying to convince voters that his record on guns is actually better than most people think. … That is a completely different political calculus, and I think that’s happening because of what’s happening in the states.” Bob Beauprez ran against Hickenlooper in 2014.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-gun-control_us_560e85d7e4b0af3706e05b04?utm_hp_ref=tw,"Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post WASHINGTON -- After a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon left at least 10 people dead and nine wounded on Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for a ""national movement"" on gun control to counteract the political power of the National Rifle Association. ""I have to tell you, Janet, I am just sick of this,"" Clinton told Janet Wu of the Boston ABC affiliate WCVB Thursday evening. ""I'm sick about it, and I feel an absolute urgency for this country to start being sensible about keeping guns away from people who should not have them."" When Wu asked why Clinton thought she could win battles against the NRA, the candidate pointed out that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the federal assault weapons ban in 1994. (The law expired in 2004.) She added that citizens themselves clearly wanted more restrictions on gun purchases, since gun control measures often pass via ballot initiative. Clinton also pointed out that a flaw in the background check system allowed Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old charged with killing nine people in Charleston, South Carolina, in June, to purchase a weapon. ""I'm going to be pushing this issue,"" she said. ""Universal background checks, a long-enough waiting period so that people can't sneak in under the deadline because the full investigation wasn't completed. I would like us to be absolutely determined, as I am, to try to do something about this."" ​This article has been updated with revised casualty figures for Thursday's shooting.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/116205445/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Democratic-senators-push-for-stronger-background-checks-for-gun-purchases/,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats vowed Thursday to push for stronger background check laws for gun purchases in the wake of last week's mass shooting at an Oregon community college. Nine people were killed at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Oct. 1 by a gunman who killed himself after being wounded by police. The shooting has prompted calls for action by the victims' families and friends, but the Republican majority in Congress has so far opposed any new restrictions on gun buyers. Acknowledging that it's not yet possible to pass stricter gun laws, Democrats said they are appealing to Americans to pressure lawmakers to act in the months ahead. Previous efforts have failed in the aftermath of other mass shootings. ""We're here to start a national movement,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor when a gunman killed 32 people in a rampage at Virginia Tech in 2007. Kaine joined about 30 other Democratic senators at a news conferences on the Capitol steps to outline a package of tougher gun laws. Supporters included Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. The issue underscores a key difference between Democratic and Republican candidates. While Sanders and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have called for stricter background check laws, Republican presidential candidates have largely opposed them. GOP candidate Ben Carson made headlines earlier this week when he said, ""I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" USA TODAY Ben Carson suggests more people should be armed Republican front-runner Donald Trump said that ""people are going to slip through the cracks"" of the mental health system, regardless of background check laws. The Democratic senators' first proposal calls for closing a loophole that allows people to buy guns online and at gun shows without undergoing the background checks that are required at big retail stores and small gun shops. A second change would ensure that people are not allowed to buy guns without a completed background check. In some states, gun buyers can take their firearms home from the store while waiting for a background check to be finished. People convicted of domestic abuse — whether against a spouse or someone they are dating — would be banned from buying guns. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has already introduced a bill that would expand the definition of a domestic abuser to include stalkers and abusers who target their dating partners. The Democrats also proposed making it a federal crime to be a ""straw buyer"" who purchases a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to have a firearm. The senators also want to strengthen penalties for illegal gun trafficking across state lines. ""The victims and their families deserve better than a Congress that shrugs its shoulders and waits for the next tragedy,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., as he spoke about the Umpqua Community College shooting. ""They deserve action."""
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-roseburg-shooting-armed-protesters,"Gun-toting protesters gathered on Friday morning to await President Obama’s arrival in Roseburg, Ore., where he planned to meet with the families of victims of last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. But local residents planned to protest Obama’s visit, saying he rushed to “politicize” the tragedy by pushing a gun control agenda. “My family, my friends, everybody down here is not happy about him coming,” Michelle Finn, a Umpqua alumna and Roseburg native, told the Oregonian. “He already says he’s going to politicize this — he’s already going to push his agenda.” A Facebook event page for a protest dubbed “Defend Roseburg – Deny barack 0bama” [sic], had garnered more than 8,000 RVSPs by Friday. In its lengthy event description, organizers suggested attendees carry a handgun as opposed to a rifle, but reiterated “you have the right to carry what you wish.” “Polarizing as usual, Mr 0bama [sic] has insisted on politicizing the event as a conduit for increased executive orders on gun control via means of his pen, and his phone,” the description continued.

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/10/horror_in_roseburg_10_minutes.html," Gallery: Oregon School Shooting - Umpqua College ROSEBURG -- In a few brutal minutes Thursday, a 26-year-old man turned Roseburg's Umpqua Community College into the site of Oregon's deadliest mass shooting -- a rampage so violent police pleaded for ""as many ambulances as possible"" and President Barack Obama went on national TV to argue, again, for tougher guns laws. The gunman shot and killed nine people before dying himself after a firefight with officers. ""There's been another mass shooting in America, this time at a community college in Oregon,"" the president said. ""It means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief ... ""I've been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there."" The gunman, whose name police have not released but The Oregonian/OregonLive confirmed as Chris Harper-Mercer, entered an Introduction to Expository Writing class in Snyder Hall around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. He carried a ""long gun,"" according to radio calls between police and emergency dispatchers, and up to three handguns. The shooting began immediately. Across campus, in adjacent classrooms, administrative offices, the cafeteria and the bookstore, hundreds of other students abandoned their textbooks, cell phones and computers in a mad race for cover as ""pop, pop, pop"" echoed. English instructor Jenny Friedman counted 15 shots. Police cars quickly blocked the only road onto campus. Some students stayed in hiding for more than two hours before police marched them out, patted them down and shepherded them onto school buses that ferried them to Douglas County Fairgrounds. Detectives, family members and the media awaited. Police arrived on campus moments after the first 911 call and declared the gunman ""neutralized"" barely eight minutes in, a swift response that witnesses and law enforcement officials say may have saved dozens of lives. About 35 people were in Snyder Hall when the shooter attacked. MORE : Who is Chris Harper-Mercer? Records, internet paint a hazy picture Still, in perhaps 10 minutes of violence, the gunman killed at least nine people and injured at least seven others. Paramedics took victims to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. Three critically injured patients were later airlifted elsewhere. Victims had been shot in the chest, back, legs and hands, hospital officials said. The killer shot a teacher in the head at point-blank range, one witness told the Roseburg News Review newspaper, and ordered students to the floor. He demanded they tell him their religious affiliation, the witness said, but did not wait for answers before firing again. Federal investigators, chasing rumors that the shooter had warned of his intentions on social media, were investigating the case as a possible hate crime. As night fell Thursday, police escorted neighbors from the apartment complex where Chris Harper-Mercer lived in nearby Winchester, and officers in camouflage and police dogs began to search his unit. Investigators also worked through every room on campus and were checking every car left behind in the community college's packed parking lot. Harper-Mercer moved through his 26 years barely leaving a paper trail to prove he existed. Public records show no brushes with law enforcement, no record of borrowing money. His parents filed for divorce in the Los Angeles area in 2005. Later, Harper-Mercer moved with his mother 790 miles north to Winchester, four miles north of Roseburg. It was not clear Thursday evening whether Harper-Mercer was shot by a police officer or if he killed himself. At least two officers exchanged fire with him, said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin. Hanlin encouraged the media and Douglas County residents not to mention the shooter by name. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to his horrific and cowardly act,"" the sheriff said. ""You will never hear me mention his name."" A full account of the dead and wounded was not available late Thursday. Although some students expressed, along with their heartbreak, frustration that they did not immediately know which classmates or instructors had been killed, Hanlin said the county's ""mass casualty"" protocol requires a wait of 24 to 48 hours before names are released. Umpqua serves about 4,600 students over the course of an academic year, a mix of recent high school graduates starting work on their college degrees and middle-aged adults returning to school in search of new skills and job opportunities. Many take classes part-time. Like community colleges across Oregon, the school offers a lower-cost higher education to any student who wishes to enroll. ""This is a community of one degree of separation,"" said Russ Wilson, associate pastor at Roseburg's New Life Christian Center. ""If you don't know somebody who goes to the school, you know somebody who knows somebody at the school."" At the time of the shooting, school officials said, one unarmed security guard was on duty. This week marked the start of the fall term, and Thursday was only the second day of classes for many students and instructors. ""We are a community college in the best sense of the word,"" said Rita Cavin, Umpqua's interim president. ""Things like this last forever. It's an emotional scar for the college."" Roseburg, a town of 22,000 three hours south of Portland, has suffered tragedy before. In 2006, Roseburg High freshman Vincent Leodoro shot fellow student Joseph Monti four times in the back while both were in the school courtyard. Monti survived, and many Roseburg-area institutions, including Umpqua Community College, responded to the attack with new plans for how to handle and prevent active shooter scenarios. More broadly, the collapse of the timber industry and the recession have devastated Douglas County, driving the median family income in Douglas County from the equivalent of $46,447 in 2000 to $40,524 two years ago. Yet this community, the latest addition to a tear-stained list that includes Littleton, Aurora and Newtown, has never suffered a loss this bloody or far-reaching. Football games and other sporting events were postponed Thursday night, and school systems across Douglas County have cancelled classes Friday. The community college itself will be closed until at least Monday. According to crowd-sourced counts, this is the 294th mass shooting in the United States so far this year and the 45th shooting on a school or college campus. ""It's sick,"" said longtime Roseburg High football coach Thurman Bell. ""You wonder what's happening in the world today. ""In Roseburg? In Roseburg?"" This story was reported by a team of Oregonian/OregonLive reporters, including Andrew Greif, Maxine Bernstein, Casey Parks, Lynne Terry, Jim Ryan, Lynne Palombo, Jeff Manning, Carli Brosseau, Andrew Theen, Nick Budnick, Everton Bailey Jr., Nuran Altier, Mike Rogoway, Emily E.

          / CBS/AP Last Updated 2:21 p.m. ET President Barack Obama said Friday the entire nation is grieving for those slain at Fort Hood, and he urged people not to jump to conclusions while law enforcement officers investigate yesterday's deadly shooting at a U.S. military base in Texas. ""We don't know all the answers yet. And I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts,"" Mr. Obama said in a Rose Garden statement otherwise devoted to the economy. ""What we do know is that there are families, friends and an entire nation grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday,"" the president said. Special Section: Tragedy at Fort Hood Federal, state and local law authorities are joining in the investigation of Thursday's deadly rampage, in which a military psychiatrist facing deployment overseas allegedly opened fire, killing 13 people, before being shot by a first responder. One of the 13 dead was a civilian. Thirty people were also wounded, with half of those hospitalized requiring surgery, Army officials said. They are all in stable condition. The shooting suspect was identified as Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan. Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, Fort Hood's base commander, told CBS's ""The Early Show"" that the suspect was shot at least twice inside a building on the base, then left the building to pursue his victims as they tried to flee, firing off more rounds. Hasan was shot a total of four times during the rampage, and was initially reported to have been killed. He is on a ventilator at a civilian hospital, under guard, and is in stable condition. All indications are there was a single shooter, and Hasan the sole suspect, said Col. John Rossi, Deputy Commanding General - Fires and Effects at Fort Hood, although a senior U.S. official did not rule out . Cone told ""Early Show"" co-anchor Harry Smith that the alleged gunman is rumored to have said ""Allahu Akbar"" - Arabic for ""God is great!"" - during the shooting, but was unable to confirm that information. At this morning's press conference officials could not confirm that the shooter said anything during the half-hour-long incident. Though the base is no longer under lockdown, it is operating at a heightened level of security. ""We are fully confident in the security of this installation and remain so,"" said Rossi. The Army is providing the post with additional grief counselors, chaplains, and public affairs support. Rossi also said this morning that about 90% of the families of victims have been notified so far. The violence was believed to be the worst mass shooting in history at a U.S. military base. ""This has been a tragic incident, and our hearts and prayers go out to all of those who have been impacted by this tragedy,"" said Rossi. As of Friday afternoon, the names of four of the dead have been released: • Spc. Jason Dean Hunt, a 22-year-old Oklahoma native, has served three and a half years in the Army, including a tour in Iraq. Hunt was married two months ago. • Sgt. Amy Krueger, 29, from Kiel, Wis., was with the Madison-based 467th Medical Detachment. She had arrived at Fort Hood just two days before the shooting, according to her mother, Jeri Krueger, and was scheduled to be sent to Afghanistan in December. • Pfc. Aaron Thomas Nemelka, 19, from Salt Lake City, Utah, enlisted in the Army in October 2008 and was to be deployed to Afghanistan next January as part of the 5/10th Engineering Company, 20th Infantry Battalion, 36th Engineering Brigade. • Pfc. Michael Pearson, 21, of Bolingbrook, Ill.  A neighbor in the suburb of Chicago told the Associated Press that the family has ""lost their gem."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said today a memorial service will be scheduled at the convenience of families who lost loved ones, and that President Obama would attend. Military officials say they are still piecing together what may have pushed Hasan, an Army psychiatrist trained to help soldiers in distress, to turn on his comrades. and are looking for clues that may have led to the military massacre. Cone says Hasan was not known to be a threat or risk, and that military officials will interrogate him as soon as possible. The shooting began around 1:30 p.m., when shots were fired at the base's Soldier Readiness Center, where soldiers who are about to be deployed or who are returning undergo medical screening. More Coverage of the Tragedy at Fort Hood: Hasan Likely ""Lone Wolf,"" Officials Say   Hasan Reportedly Felt U.S. Attacked Islam  List of Fort Hood Dead, Wounded Neighbor: Ft.

Hood Suspect  U.S. Army Base Violence Has Bloody HistoryTragedy at Fort Hood Fort Hood spokesman Christopher Haug said Friday that the guns used in the attack were believed to be Hasan's ""own private firearms."" It was unclear what the motive was, though it appeared he was upset about a scheduled deployment. U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said the Army major was about to deploy overseas, though it was unclear if he was headed to Iraq or Afghanistan and when he was scheduled to leave. Hutchison said she was told about the upcoming deployment by generals based at Fort Hood. The victims of the shooting have not been identified but Cone said Thursday night that the slain included U.S. soldiers and a civilian police officer working at the base. He said that no children had been killed to his knowledge. ""It's a terrible tragedy. It's stunning,"" Cone said. ""Soldiers and family members and many of the great civilians that work here are absolutely devastated."" The wounded are dispersed among several central Texas hospitals and the extent of their injuries varied, Cone said. Statement From Suspect's Family Hasan, 39, is a licensed psychiatrist who has lived in Bethesda and Silver Spring, Md. and various places in Virginia, where he grew up. A spokesman for Texas Sen. Hutchison said Hasan was upset about an upcoming deployment to Iraq. He is an American citizen of Jordanian descent, and a lifelong Muslim. He is a graduate of Virginia Tech University, where he was a member of the ROTC and earned a bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1997. He received his medical degree from the military's Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., in 2001. Military officials say Hasan worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. (where he did his internship, residency and a fellowship) for six years before being transferred to the Texas base in July. The officials had access to Hasan's military record. They said he received a poor performance evaluation while at Walter Reed. In a statement released to the media Thursday night, Hasan's family said they were ""shocked and saddened by the terrible events at Fort Hood."" The full statement from the unnamed cousin said: ""Nidal was an American citizen. He was born in Arlington, Virginia and raised here in America. He attended local high schools and eventually went on to attend Virginia Tech.  We are filled with grief for the families of today's victims. Our family loves America. We are proud of our country, and saddened by today's tragedy. Because this situation is still unfolding, we have nothing else that we are able to share with you at this time."" Faizul Khan, a former imam at a mosque Hasan attended in Silver Spring, Maryland, said he spoke often with Hasan about how Hasan wanted to find a wife. Hasan was a lifelong Muslim and attended prayers regularly, often in his Army uniform, Khan said. Video from a convenience store that reportedly shows Hasan making a purchase just hours before the alleged attack shows him wearing a shalwar kameez, a traditional robe worn primarily in Afhganistan and Pakistan - but not in the Arab world where Hasan has his roots. CBS News correspondent Sheila MacVicar reports that, possibly even more telling about the shop video, is that the man in the video is wearing all-white, a color associated in Islam with death or mourning. President Obama, speaking before a scheduled event in Washington, said, ""It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil."" ""I would ask all Americans to keep the men and women of Fort Hood in your thoughts and prayers. We will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident,"" Mr. Obama said. Covering 339 square miles, Fort Hood is the largest active duty armored post in the United States. Home to about 52,000 troops as of earlier this year, the sprawling base is located halfway between Austin and Waco. The base is home to nine schools - seven elementary schools and two middle schools - and all were on lockdown, said Killeen school spokesman Todd Martin. Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Tela Mange said Texas Rangers and state troopers were en route to Fort Hood to help seal the perimeter of the 108,000 acre base. Fort Hood officially opened on Sept. 18, 1942, and was named in honor of Gen. John Bell Hood. It has been continuously used for armored training and is charged with maintaining readiness for combat missions.

A board member at All Dulles Area Muslim Society in Sterling, Va., contacted local police to ask for extra patrols. Friday is Islam's main communal prayer day. In the Chicago area, the Islamic Society of Northwest Suburbs of Chicago sent e-mails asking Muslims to be more careful. The Mosque Foundation president in Bridgeview says he's called police to put them on high alert. Zaher Sahloul says he fears something could be done to Muslims because of ""misguided anger."" His name had barely been released, his heritage and history not immediately known, but the reaction to the suspect accused in the Fort Hood shooting was fast and furious. ""Jihad at Fort Hood?"" read the headline of a post on the Jihad Watch blog just moments after Hasan was identified as the alleged perpetrator of a mass shooting at the Texas military base that killed 12 people and wounded 31 others. ""The name tells us a lot, does it not, senator?"" Fox News's Shep Smith said while interviewing Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas senator. Hasan, a U.S. Army major, was initially reported to be among the 13 dead, but late Thursday, a U.S. Army spokesman said he was in hospital in stable condition, The death toll did not change, however, because one of the injured victims died in hospital. More Coverage of the Tragedy at Fort Hood: Neighbor: Ft. Hood Suspect Packed Up Home  ""Allahu Akbar"": Hasan's Words as He Fired?  Anti-Muslim Backlash Immediate  Under Attack, Soldiers' Instincts Kick In Female Cop Hailed as Ft. Hood Hero  Military Spouse's Reaction  Forensic Psychiatrist on Possible Mindset of Ft. Hood Suspect  Store's Video May Show Ft. Hood Suspect Tragedy at Fort Hood The Arab-American Institute said it received one threatening call from an unidentified male shortly after Hasan's name was released. The group, which condemned the massacre, said it expected more. The Council on American-Islamic Relations scheduled a Capitol Hill news conference on Thursday night to urge calm. ""No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence,"" the group said in a statement. ""The attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all-volunteer army that protects our nation. American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured."" Hasan was reportedly born and raised in Virginia, the son of immigrant parents from a small town near Jerusalem. He joined the military right out of high school, and the Army put him through college and then medical school, where he trained to be a psychiatrist. A cousin told the New York Times he started having second thoughts about his military career a few years ago after other soldiers harassed him for being a Muslim. He was also traumatized by the stories he heard from returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder as he counseled them at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and later, at Fort Hood. ""He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,"" Nader Hasan told the Times. ""He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there."" Robert Spencer, the director of the Jihad Watch blog and the author of nine books on Islam and jihad, chastised the media for failing to point to jihad as a possible explanation for the shooting. ""No one, no one at all, in the mainstream media is discussing jihad as a motivation,"" Spencer wrote. ""It's all about 'snapping,' 'not wanting to go to war'.... If this turns out to be a jihad attack, watch for the president to caution against 'backlash' and 'Islamophobia.""' Elsewhere in the blogosphere, there were warnings of exactly that kind of backlash. ""How long before some idiotic elected official declares Muslims shouldn't be allowed to serve in the military?"" asked Salon's Mike Madden. The American Prospect's Adam Serwer beseeched: ""Please, America, remember what kind of country you are right now."" Josh Marshall, who writes for the TalkingPointsMemo blog, predicted ""dark"" times ahead. The fact Hasan is a Muslim ""is going to be the focus of attention,"" Marshall wrote. The commenters on Jihad Watch were unforgiving in the hours after the shooting. ""The war on terror is over, and the war on Islam has begun,"" one wrote. Al Siddiq, president of the Islamic Center of Waco, told the Waco Tribune Herald he feared a backlash, noting that all Muslims get lumped together when the unthinkable happens. He said the situation was especially painful because the U.S. Army has reached out to Muslims. ""The Army has accommodated Muslims. Not any other army can offer what the U.S. Army offers,"" said Siddiq, who served as a U.S. soldier in Korea. ""That's what hurts me the most.""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/115649501/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Ben-Carson-On-gun-control-Snowden-%e2%80%94-and-Trump/,"NEW YORK — Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who trails only Donald Trump at the top of the Republican presidential field, says the lesson of the nation's latest mass shooting isn't to enact more limits on guns but to consider whether gun-free zones actually may be drawing shooters. In a wide-ranging interview with Capital Download, Carson endorsed expanding efforts to identify and treat the mentally ill before they commit acts of violence. He also suggested it might make sense to arm kindergarten teachers, and he rejected as wrong-headed proposals to restore the ban on military-style assault weapons. ""Would that have prevented this? No,"" Carson told USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker series. ""Would it have prevented the one before? No. I'm for doing things that work, not for things that stroke the emotions."" Carson outlines how he says his political philosophy on gun control and other issues is grounded in the Constitution in a new book, A More Perfect Union, being published Tuesday by Sentinel. One of the trio of outsiders who have shaken the GOP race this year, the renowned pediatric neurosurgeon combines a soft-spoken manner with strongly held and hard-edged conservative views, particularly on social issues. ""If I had a little kid in kindergarten somewhere I would feel much more comfortable if I knew on that campus there was a police officer or somebody who was trained with a weapon,"" he says. Including the teacher? ""If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" He says the idea of declaring gun-free zones may be counterproductive. The gunmen ""tend to pick places that are gun-free zones,"" he says. ""They aren't likely to go into a place where they are likely to get shot."" He keeps a gun himself at a home he owns in a secluded area, ""way out in the country, away from the police, away from anybody,"" he says. ""If someone is, you know, threatening your life or the life of your family and you don't have ready access to the police, I would prefer to have a mechanism for protecting myself."" But he's never had to use it. The nation's continuing debate over gun control has been spotlighted by the shooting rampage last week at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., that left nine victims dead before the shooter allegedly killed himself. Umpqua bans guns and other weapons, but state law allows people with concealed permits to carry guns on the campus. While Carson once supported the idea of banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition, he says he changed his mind after he read more about the history of tyranny, a subject explored in his new 240-page book. ""Reading people like Daniel Webster, who talked about tyranny in Europe and said it would never occur in America because the American people were armed,"" he says. ""When you look at tyranny and how it occurs, the pattern is so consistent: Get rid of the guns for the people first so you can go in and dominate them."" Asked whether many Americans worried less about the threat from the government and more about the threat of fellow citizens armed with assault rifles, Carson replied: ""You need to be able to protect yourself from both."" Carson, now 64, admits to being surprised with his political rise since his address to the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 drew the attention of evangelical Christians and others who urged him to get into politics. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls, Trump runs first in the Republican field at 23%, followed by Carson at 17% and former CEO Carly Fiorina at 11%. Among the more traditional contenders — that is, those who have previously held elective office —only Florida Sen. Marco Rubio breaks into double digits, at 10%. USA TODAY What's the appeal of Ben Carson? Iowans say he inspires ""It says that the people are actually starting to wake up and recognize that politics-as-usual is not taking us where we want to be,"" Carson says of the strength of the outsider candidates. ""In fact, it's leading us in exactly the opposite direction."" He rejects any parallel to the observation that a president should have experience in politics, just as most people wouldn't choose a brain surgeon who had never been in an operating room before. ""Neurosurgery is considerably more complicated than politics,"" he scoffs. ""You don't need to know nearly as much to be able to maneuver in the political world as you do in the operating room inside of somebody's brain. It's not even close."""
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/wQU1wv-ZA1g/,"Police are searching for a suspect who carved anti-religious hate messages on cars in a parking lot at the University of California Davis on Saturday. Eleven cars were vandalized, among which eight had their tires slashed and five were keyed with hateful messages, CBS Sacramento reports, adding that police are looking for “a man in his mid-20s of average height and weight and was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and had a messenger-style bag.” The anti-religious vandalism, which police are investigating as a hate crime, comes on the heels of a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, carried out by a man who ranted against religion online and had a history of mental and emotional problems. It is the second case of anti-religious vandalism at UC Davis this year, after a Jewish fraternity was daubed with swastikas in February following an anti-Israel vote by student leaders. Local news, including NBC News affiliate KCRA, carried a statement that UC Davis chancellor Linda P. B. Katehi issued in response to the vandalism: “I am deeply troubled and disappointed that the campus community has experienced another incident that included damaged property and, even more grievously, offensive and disparaging slurs.This is conduct most unbecoming and completely against our principles of community,” Katehi said.

http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/10/we_can_stop_gun_violence_opinion.html,"Barack Obama A file photo of President Barack Obama. (Associated Press) By Rabbi Jay M. Kornsgold On Wednesday, August 26, in Moneta, Virginia, Allison Parker, a 24-year-old reporter, and Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman, were shot to death on live television by a disgruntled ex-employee. On June 17 a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, during a Bible study session. Nine people were killed by a gunman, including the Senior Pastor, State Senator Clementa Pinckney. These are two of the many well-known incidents of gun violence that took place this past year. The day of the Virginia shooting incident was the 238th day of the year and the 247th mass-shooting incident of the year. Since the December 2012 school shooting in Newton, Connecticut, at least 133 school shootings have taken place in America.  This is an average of nearly one a week. If that were not enough, here are a few more sobering statistics: - American children are 14 times as likely to die from guns as children in any other developed country in the world. - More Americans die in gun homicides and suicides every six months than have died in the last 25 years in every terrorist attack and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. Gun violence is out of control in the United States and it is getting worse each year. Elie Wiesel, the famous author, human rights activist and Holocaust survivor, is often quoted as saying that during any large scale, life-threatening crisis, you will find three kinds of people: Victims, Perpetrators and Bystanders.  My colleague, Rabbi Nina Mandel, believes gun violence in America is such a large scale, life-threatening crisis. Who are the Victims? They are the innocent children, women and men that die or sustain permanent injury, because of a culture of violence that promotes gun ownership and weak regulation.  They are the children who live in areas where they are more likely to be killed by a gun than they are to graduate from high school. Who are the Perpetrators? The perpetrators are NOT law-abiding, responsible gun owners. They are those who make money on the free trade of guns.  The perpetrators are the state and federal lawmakers who block legislation that would allow individual records to be shared, records that could prevent guns ending up in the hands of criminals. Who are the Bystanders?  That's us.  Those of us who are horrified when the random, mass killing happens - wringing our hands and wracking our brains about why - but failing to speak out.  Bystanders see the problem, but believe nothing can be done about it. There is one more category of people needed today - the Actor. The actor is the activist who calls his/her congressperson to support comprehensive gun control reform. The actors are the family members who speak out at funerals and rallies, sharing their pain and their loss and asking that the violence end with their dead children. The actors are local lawmakers who push for better education, better healthcare, and better regulation to stem gun violence. It is time for all of us to join with Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence, a diverse coalition of denominations and faith-based organizations, to rally support for immediate legislative action to accomplish the following: 1. Every person who buys a gun should pass a criminal background check, including guns sold on-line, at gun shows and through private sales. 2. High-capacity weapons and ammunition magazines should not be available to civilians. There is no legitimate self-defense or sporting purpose for these military-style, high capacity weapons and magazines. They are, however, the weapons of choice for those who want to shoot and kill a large number of people quickly. 3. Gun trafficking should be a federal crime. Currently, prosecutions only happen through a law that prohibits selling guns without a federal license, which carries the same punishment as trafficking chicken or livestock. We also need to invest in mental health and public health support and in targeted investments and approaches from the Federal Government in areas most impacted by gun violence. People of all faiths should email or call your Senators and Congressperson and ask them to support legislation that will prevent guns from getting into the wrong people's hands. On the Jewish high holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we ask ourselves some very basic questions:  Who are we, as human beings?  Why do we exist?   We blow the Shofar (Rams horn) to awaken our souls, to face some difficult truths, to examine our actions and inactions and to change the path we chose to take from ""bystander"" to ""actor"". Following my sermon on gun violence on Rosh Hashanah, a member of the congregation asked if any of these actions could truly alleviate the crisis in our country.  The problem is too complicated, to entrenched for us to really make an impact.  I replied with the words of a great Jewish Rabbi philosopher, who pointed out, it is not the task of someone else ""over there"" to change what needs to be changed; it is our task.  And while we cannot necessarily complete the task, we are not free to abandon it.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-weighs-white-house-moves-gun-control," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows As President Obama heads to Roseburg, Oregon for closed-door visits with families of the victims of last week's shootings at Umpqua Community College, the White House is considering wading once more into the politically-fraught issue of gun control. The administration is reconsidering a major gun control proposal that would establish new guidelines for who is legally defined as a licensed gun dealer and therefore required to conduct background checks on potential buyers, administration officials tell NBC News. The proposal would define anyone who sells more a certain number of guns each year ""in the business"" of selling guns and therefore subject to laws for gun dealers. According to sources, the administration has considered 50 or 100 guns a year as the threshold to trigger these requirements, although they have not formally settled on a number. ""This is a super-complicated policy,"" said one administration official who was familiar with the idea. RELATED: Gunman kills 1, injures 3 at Northern Arizona University: School officials In the wake of the deadly Oregon shooting in which nine people were killed and nine others were injured, the president pledged to have staff ""scrub"" existing gun laws in search of ways to push for reform. The president has often expressed frustration that political opposition has gotten in the way of gun control provisions. Administration officials considered this executive order in 2013, after a bill requiring background checks for almost all gun sales failed to pass in the Senate. They ultimately opted against it, wary of both the complexity of defining who is a gun dealer and potential lawsuits arguing the executive order was illegal. But they are reconsidering issuing such an order as part of a broader review of gun policy in the wake of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. The idea drew renewed attention when Hillary Clinton, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, said she would take such an executive action if elected. Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control group, also called for Obama to adopt this policy. ""These sellers are selling hundreds of thousands of guns without background checks,"" said Adam Skaggs, senior counsel for Everytown. The National Rifle Association blasted this idea. Hillary Clinton's anti-gun proposal shows her ignorance of gun laws. http://t.co/QiYuJv4aaI #2A #ProGun There is little national data on gun purchases, so it's not clear how many gun sales this would affect. But gun control advocates say they are worried a growing number of weapons are sold outside the background check process, either online or at gun shows. Some advocates of this executive order say it would actually expand the number of background checks more than the unsuccessful 2013 bill, which had a number of exemptions. Obama aides have not given a timetable on when or if the president will determine if he wants to adopt this proposal. Obama has already used his executive authority repeatedly over the last two years to implement his policies, particularly on immigration. However, Obama's executive order to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants remains in a protracted court battle, and administration officials say this gun provision, if implemented, would likely be challenged by conservatives in courts. WATCH: Former Newtown teacher responds to Ben Carson But gun control advocates say Obama long ago should have issued the executive order and that he has bowed to political, not legal, considerations in not taking action. According to sources, some senior officials at both the White House and Department of Justice, including then-Attorney General Eric Holder, had argued the executive action was legal and proper when it was being considered. Many of the key Senate races in 2014 were in pro-gun states like Alaska and Arkansas. ""I think there was a lot of pressure on the White House to let this go for a while,"" said one gun control advocate, who is working with Obama administration officials on gun policy and did not want to criticize them publicly. ""Now, in his last 16 months, he can do this,"" he added. This article originally appeared on NBCNews.com. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

October 19, 2015 Gun control activists demonstrated in front of the White House on Saturday. (Photo: Jeff Malet Photography/Newscom) A new activist group rallied in front of the White House Saturday morning, demanding executive and legislative action on gun control from the president and Congress. Inspired by President Barack Obama’s lament this month that gun violence “has become routine” and frustrated by government inaction, Faith Elizabeth Grant founded the group A New Routine For America. Grant tells The Daily Signal she hopes to reinvigorate existing advocacy organizations and push forward the debate. “We want to get groups motivated and citizens activated on the issue, to call for solutions and results instead of waiting on the gridlock that is Washington, D.C.” The activist also had sharp words for the president, whom she says “needs to find ways to work with the other side.” According to Grant, Obama’s current approach has “really alienated a whole group of people who might have different view on other political issues besides gun legislation.” She says that by “making them a separate obstacle,” the president “is keeping us from achieving our goal of keeping our communities safe.” “He could do more to open up a wider conversation, a more compassionate conversation on what can be done to come together and find common ground on some of these issues.” First highlighted by the New York Times last week, the rally gathered three-dozen protesters outside the White House’s East Lawn. The group prayed, chanted, and read names of mass-shooting victims. When heckled by two opponents passing by, Grant led the group in chanting: “What do we want? Executive action! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Legislative action! When do we want it? Now!” According to Ladd Everitt, communications director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, the tide is turning in the gun-control debate. “There’s been sea change moments in this country on gay marriage and the Confederate flag,” Everitt tells The Daily Signal. “This country is coming to our [next] sea-change moment. … America is in the process of rejecting radical gun culture.” According to Gallup’s annual polling on gun control, more than 70 percent of Americans in recent years would oppose a law that bans handguns. A poll from Gallup in January found that 31 percent of Americans support enacting gun laws that are more strict. After the shooting at Umpqua Community College, “there’s a whole new dynamic in the Democratic Party where they’re jumping over each other to talk about it [gun violence],” Everitt says. But talking points aren’t enough for Nardyne Jefferies, who lost her only child to a drive-by shooting five years ago. Addressing the crowd, Jefferies held up a picture of her 16-year-old daughter’s body “to show the reality of gun violence.” “We need our politicians to lead us in front of the microphones and not from behind,” she said. “There’s no need to stand behind the microphone giving your condolences.” Afterwards, Jefferies told The Daily Signal she wishes Obama would act more aggressively on the issue. She wants him to “call surviving parents” and demand action from Congress. “Every time there’s a shooting, our president comes on the microphone. And everyone’s sad and saying the same thing.” While Jefferies appreciates the sympathy, she wants the administration to “be more proactive, not reactive.” The most recent debate in Congress took place following the Newtown, Conn., shooting in 2012. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., proposed a gun control amendment on background checks that failed when four Democrats joined most Republicans in opposition. Toomey and Machin indicated they could team up again this year for another push, perhaps aimed at mental illness. “Anytime something happens outside of Washington, [Obama] he’s on the plane and gone there and he’s talking,” Jefferies says. “Again, I don’t really get it. Your words can’t really save anybody.” The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you. Donate now Philip Wegmann is a White House reporter for RealClearNews.

October 09, 2015 Pro-gun protesters in Roseburg, Ore. (Photo: Robin Loznak/ZUMA Press/Newscom) In the week after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Ore., Senate Democrats gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to demand stricter gun control and unveil their comprehensive policy package to achieve it. Frustrated by the inaction of Republicans and hamstrung by a lack of votes, the group of more than two dozen Senate Democrats sought to spark debate by appealing directly to the public. “The roll call of American gun tragedies is already far too long,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. “The victims and their families deserve better than a Congress that shrugs its shoulder and waits for the next tragedy.” Rallying around three “principles of action,” the group proposed laws to close background check loopholes, expand background databases, and crack down on illegal gun sales. Numerically virtually impossible to pass in the Republican-controlled House, gun control legislation also faces an uphill battle in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that Democrats will move when the American people speak. “Once that groundswell is heard,” he said, “we will draft legislation in line with these principles.” On Thursday, Schumer noted that Senate Democrats plan to employ “all the procedural means that we can” to get a vote. And according to The New York Times, Democrats are preparing to block all other Senate motions to force their legislation onto the floor. In 2013, the last time the Senate considered gun control legislation, Democrats controlled the chamber. The Manchin-Toomey bill would have required background checks on almost all gun sales. The legislation won 54 votes, falling just six votes shy of the filibuster-proof threshold. Now, 14 Republican lawmakers would need to join a completely unified Democrat caucus to overcome the current threat of filibuster. But already one Senate Democrat tells The Daily Signal she plans to oppose key elements of the legislation. “I have made clear where I stand on background checks legislation, and that hasn’t changed,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., said in a statement. “As a result, I can’t support this proposal.” Even without party unity, Democrats could still tie their proposals to upcoming legislation perceived by some as must-pass, like the highway funding bill. With just 41 votes, the party could force the issue. From the other side of the aisle Thursday, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, warned Democrats that increased gun control was a non-starter. “Some of our Democratic colleagues have said that they’re going to introduce some gun control legislation,” he said in a Senate floor speech. “We all know [that] has been tried before and cannot pass this chamber.” The Republican majority whip has introduced legislation to combat mental health issues connected with gun violence by building legal tools for court-ordered psychiatric supervision. Cornyn maintains that this bill provides the best avenue toward bipartisan consensus and addresses “the root cause of some of these horrific events.” If Democrats fail to pass gun control in the Senate, they may succeed in the White House. According to NBC News, the Obama administration may go it alone, acting on this issue by executive order. The proposal would redefine a gun dealer as anyone selling more than a specific number of firearms. NBC reports that the president hasn’t decided on a number yet, but anyone above the limit would qualify as “in the business” and incur responsibility for mandatory background checks. Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute of Legislative Action, accused President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats of attempting to politicize catastrophe. “If Obama and gun control advocates were serious, they would address the underlying issue of America’s broken mental health system,” Cox said in a statement. “Instead, they push gun control initiatives that would not have prevented any of the tragedies they seek to exploit.”  The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

http://www.nationalmemo.com/one-killed-three-wounded-in-northern-arizona-university-shooting/,"By David Schwartz PHOENIX (Reuters) – An 18-year-old student killed one peer and wounded three others when he opened fire during a confrontation on the Northern Arizona University campus early on Friday before being arrested, in another shooting to hit a U.S. school, authorities said. The suspected gunman was identified as Steven Jones, a freshman at the university in Flagstaff, campus police chief Gregory Fowler said. He said Jones pulled the handgun in a “confrontation” with several students. Colin Brough was killed in the shooting, according to the university. The three injured students, identified as Nicholas Prato, Kyle Zientek and Nicholas Piring, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and were being treated at Flagstaff Medical Center, Fowler said. Their conditions were not disclosed. The shooting occurred just hours before President Barack Obama was scheduled to visit Roseburg, Oregon to meet privately with families of nine people killed in a mass shooting at a community college there last week. A university spokeswoman said the Arizona incident occurred in a parking lot next to a residence hall for Greek organizations – fraternities and sororities – around 1:20 a.m. “We don’t know the facts yet about what brought them together, or what caused the confrontation,” Fowler said. Delta Chi International Fraternity executive director Justin Sherman said the four victims were members of the fraternity but the alleged gunman was not. Jones, who did not try to flee, was arrested by university police and is cooperating with authorities, Fowler said. He said guns are not allowed to be carried on campus. The university said Jones was charged with first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault, and that he would be arraigned by video on Friday afternoon. Classes were to continue as scheduled on Friday for the school’s 20,000 students, university president Rita Cheng told a news conference, calling the incident isolated. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and Arizona U.S. Senator John McCain, both Republicans, extended thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. Obama reacted to the killings in Oregon by vowing to step up efforts to curb U.S. gun violence. Gun rights advocates said the Oregon shootings underscored the importance of the right of Americans to bear arms and defend themselves. Just hours after the Arizona shooting, police said one person was killed and another wounded in a shooting at an apartment complex near the campus of Texas Southern University in Houston, and a suspect had been taken into custody.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ben-carsons-supporters-see-through-his-gaffes," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows As a Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has said that: Those comments have been dissected across network news, ridiculed on nighttime and daytime talk shows and slammed by various advocacy groups. But to his fans, Carson is simply a ""nice,"" ""rational"" and ""a really genuine guy."" During his three-state tour across America earlier this month, everywhere he went, Carson was met with cheering crowds full of ardent supporters who were quick to dismiss the controversies and criticism because, simply, they like Dr. Ben Carson. ""There's just so much about him that we trust,"" said Maureen Edsen, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom who brought three of her four young kids to see Carson speak in Ankeny, Iowa, last week. RELATED: The 'revival type' appeal of Ben Carson Asked about the recent controversy over his comments opposing the idea of a Muslim president, she said: ""There's something about him that when things like that are said, I guess I take it with a grain of salt."" It's that ""something"" — Carson's calm demeanor, disarming wit and inspiring personal story — that has emerged as one of his His often incendiary comments aren't new — Carson first made national headlines with his direct challenge to President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 — but his popularity hasn't diminished as he's added to the number of controversial remarks as a candidate under the increased scrutiny that's come with his status. Instead, his appeal has only grown. Two polls out this week showed Carson leading the pack in Iowa, surging ahead of Trump by nine points in the most recent survey, from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News. He raised the most of any candidate in the GOP field in the third quarter, and the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found him to be the most popular candidate in the 2016 field. Carson's affable disposition acts as both a defense against attacks from other candidates, who seem wary of taking on the nicest guy in the field, and a defense against himself, when he blunders into another jaw-dropping gaffe. RELATED: Ben Carson rolls out first ads of the 2016 campaign And, at times, it can seem like Carson's supporters have seen an entirely different candidate from the one presented in the media. ""I think Dr. Carson has a lot of really refreshing new ideas, and the way he proposes things is with a great deal of finesse and a great deal of professionalism, without putting down other candidates,"" Amanda Sobel, a grad student at the University of New Hampshire said after his town hall there last week. She said the way he addressed issues was ""very refreshing, very inspiring — even his stances on race in this country, that we need to be getting people to work together and love their neighbors."" No matter that Carson had joked during that town hall about running from cops ""back in the day, before they would shoot you."" Or that the day before he said progressives are ""racist"" because ""they don't believe that if you are black you have the ability you be an independent thinker."" Asked about the cop comment, Sobel dismissed the controversy as America being ""too overly sensitive about everything that comes out of people's mouths."" Indeed, many of his supporters say they appreciate his willingness to stand up to what he calls the ""PC police,"" which Carson's warned could send America down the path to tyranny. Rebecca Sykes, a 36-year-old mother of five, brought her family to Berean Baptist Church in North Carolina to see the man she and her children learn about during their homeschooling sessions. They've read his books, she said, and ""Dr. Ben Carson is a hero for us."" ""I appreciate that he loves the Lord,"" she added, and ""that he stands against the political incorrectness of our world. I want my young men to see a man who stands for what he believes in."" Carson's earned their trust because of the way he acts on the stump, but also because of the way he's lived. He tells it on every stump: The inspiring up-from-nothing tale of a troubled inner-city boy who, through a focus on education and God, became a world-reknowned, decorated pediatric neurosurgeon. RELATED: Ben Carson has an odd plan for the Dept of Education He founded a successful educational charity, and quite literally saved tens of thousands of infants' lives. There's evidence, too, that his personal story could expand the GOP tent. Sharon Craver, the executive assistant to the CEO of Victory Junction, a camp for kids with special health needs in North Carolina that Carson toured, said she's a registered Democrat and has never voted for a Republican before. But Carson, she said, was a Republican ""I could potentially see myself voting for,"" because he ""sounds very smart and has helped children."" ""Anybody that takes care of kids and has a heart for kids is somebody to have a serious thought for president,"" she said. And a man who's seen so much success at something so complex must be, as Carson's supporters said at nearly every event, smart. He occasionally peppers his speeches with complicated medical terms, but they never confuse; Carson is adept at explaining complex subjects in simple terms. Someone that smart, they seem to say, must know what he's talking about when he warns of an ""electromagnetic pulse from the sun"" knocking out our electrical grid; or when he says being gay is a choice because people go into prison straight and come out gay. That was the calculation John Breschia, a senior at the University of New Hampshire who attended Carson's town hall there, made about Carson's stance on evolution. The senior English major said he's not a creationist and believes in evolution himself, but appreciates the way in which Carson explained his own skepticism with the concept, which was that ""God gave the creatures he made the ability to adapt to their environment."" ""He didn't actually say this,"" Breschia said, ""but what I interpreted it as is he doesn't actually believe that evolution just happened. He believes that God made it so that evolution is part of God's plan for a beautiful world."" He added: ""It's great that a man of science can also believe in God, that he can reconcile two opposing viewpoints and bring them together into something that's understandable and believable for everyone."" Carson's advisers know his personality is one of the candidate's main assets. Communications Director Doug Watts said that in early focus groups, they found that voters knew a remarkable amount about Carson's life and story, and everything they felt about him was positive. RELATED: What's behind Carson's lead in Iowa? Watts said that a few intangibles — that he's ""authentic, unguarded, soft-spoken, disarmingly honest"" — come across when Carson's on the stump or in a television studio and help him overcome some of his perhaps poorly-chosen words. ""People tend to find the positive and the informative and the substantive message of what he's saying, and overlook some of the mistakes or some of the more garbled expressions because they're feeling an affinity for him,"" Watts said. But his advisers also know that Carson may not enjoy that advantage forever. Watts acknowledged ""of course we are"" concerned about how Carson's comments could impact his viability. ""They do have an accrual effect on the personality of a candidate."" And though his tendency toward rhetorical bomb-throwing rivals Trump's, he thus far hasn't had to contend with the same level of hand-wringing and calls to exit the race from party elders. Charlie Black, who served as John McCain's campaign chairman in 2008, said that's because his personal style overshadows his words. ""Dr. Carson's personality and likeability causes people to cut him some slack,"" he said, when asked why Carson's gotten away with saying things that might have felled a more traditional politician. ""He comes from outside the political world, where what you say and your observations are more like someone in the public sphere,"" Black said.

http://www.nationalmemo.com/oregon-town-reels-from-classroom-carnage/,"By Eric M. Johnson and Courtney Sherwood ROSEBURG, Ore. (Reuters) – Residents of a quiet Oregon town struggled to comprehend the carnage left by the latest U.S. mass shooting as investigators puzzled over what drove a young gunman to kill nine people in a college classroom before he died in an exchange of gunfire with police. The Thursday late-morning shooting rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, a former timber town of 20,000 on the western edge of the Cascade Mountains, ranked as the deadliest mass killing this year in the United States. The gunman stormed into a classroom in Snyder Hall on campus, shot a professor at point-blank range, then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before he shot them one by one, according to survivors’ accounts. Seven people were hospitalized, three of them listed as critical. The killer died after exchanging gunfire with two police officers who confronted him. The gunman was not identified by local authorities, and Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin vowed never to utter his name. But a law enforcement source confirmed media reports naming the suspect as Chris Harper-Mercer, 26. In a photo posted on what was believed to be his MySpace profile, a young man with a shaved head and dark-rimmed eyeglasses stares into the camera while holding a rifle. “WE’VE BECOME NUMB” At the White House, a visibly angry President Barack Obama challenged Americans across the political spectrum to press their elected leaders to enact tougher firearms-safety laws. He lashed out at the National Rifle Association gun lobby for blocking reforms and lamented how common mass shootings had become. “Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine,” he said. “We’ve become numb to this.” Residents at an apartment house a short distance from campus where the suspect lived recognized him from photos and described him as edgy. A man identifying himself as Ian Mercer, the gunman’s father, spoke briefly to a throng of reporters and camera crews outside his home in Los Angeles on Thursday night. “It’s been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,” he said, according to a transcript provided by KNBC-TV. Authorities offered no motive for the shooting. Hanlin, the county sheriff, said an investigation was underway by homicide detectives and federal agents. Residents of Roseburg, about 260 miles (420 km) south of Portland, were left to ponder the how and why of the violence. “ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?” Accounts from survivors were chilling. Stacy Boylan, the father of an 18-year-old student who was wounded but survived by playing dead, told CNN his daughter recalled seeing her professor being shot point blank as the assailant stormed into the classroom. “He was able to stand there and start asking people one by one what their religion was,” Boylan said, relating the ordeal as described by his daughter. “‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them. … ‘If you’re a Christian, stand up. Good. Because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’ and he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line, doing this to people.” Scores of people huddled at a somber candlelight vigil in a park on Thursday night. “We need to start loving each other as people … or our nation is going to start falling apart,” said Michael Sprague, 35, a businessman who lives in the Roseburg area. The violence in Roseburg was the latest in a flurry of mass killings in recent years across the United States and the deadliest so far in 2015. It surpassed the nine killed in a gun battle between motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the nine who died in the rampage at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June. Not counting Thursday’s incident, 293 mass shootings have been reported this year, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The violence has fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and for better care for the mentally ill. Those grieving at Thursday night’s vigil said they were still trying to understand the tragedy. “You know, there’s all this stuff in the news and with politics going on about the Second Amendment and gun control,” said Ken Shemel. “It’s like, ‘Come on, guys, just give us a second to breathe,’ you know?” (Additional reporting by Jane Ross in Roseburg, Shelby Sebens in Portland, Curtis Skinner in San Francisco, Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Fiona Ortiz in Chicago, Jeff Mason and Robert Rampton in Washington, Dan Whitcomb, Piya Sinha-Roy and Daina Beth Solomon in Los Angeles and Katie Reilly in New York; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) Photo: People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon October 1, 2015.  REUTERS/Steve Dipaola Know first.

In a Facebook post, Chris Mintz recalled that the day of the massacre at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg ""started so normal"" with him laughing at a teacher's jokes during a writing class. ""There was a bunch of yelling that started in the other room, my teacher walked up to the door that connected our classroom and asked if everyone was OK, no one could tell what the yelling was,"" Mintz wrote. ""The teacher knocked on the door and there were gunshots that sounded like firecrackers going off."" RELATED: Pres. Obama meets families of Ore. shooting victims Mintz said he held the door open as classmates ran toward the library, where he eventually followed and warned people there by running through the aisles shouting. He then ran back towards the campus' Snyder Hall, screaming at oblivious students to run for their lives. ""I saw a young girl who seemed to just be showing up to school and I yelled at her, 'You can't be here ... there's somebody shooting, you need to leave',"" Mintz recounted. ""Her face, it changed, she seemed so scared. This is when I started making my way towards the classroom, I was walking slower, but as fast as a could because I didn't know where he was. I got to a classroom and looked into the door because it had a glass slate, a guy that was further away and hiding behind cars startled me and yelled, ""Don't man, he's going to shoot you, man."" Mintz said he could see only a single female student through the door but recalled that ""she was screaming and yelling and covered in blood."" He motioned to her to be quiet — not realizing that the classroom was actually full of people. ""All of a sudden, the shooter opened the classroom door beside the door to my left, he leaned half of his torso out and started shooting as I turned toward him,"" Mintz wrote in his account on Facebook. ""He had a black shirt on, a shaved head, was tan and wearing glasses, he was so nonchalant through it all, like he was playing a video game and showed no emotion. The shots knocked me to the ground and felt like a truck hit me."" Gunman Christopher Harper-Mercer, who killed nine and then himself, shot Mintz in the hand and said: ""That's what you get for calling the cops,"" according to the 30-year-old. ""I laid there, in a fetal position unable to move and responded, 'I didn't call the cops, man, they were already on the way,'"" Mintz wrote. ""He leaned further out of the classroom and tried to shoot my phone. I yelled, 'It's my kid's birthday, man' [and] he pointed the gun right at my face and then he retreated back into the class. I'm still confused at why he didn't shoot me again."" Mintz said he ""tried to push myself back against the classroom door but I couldn't move at all."" He added: ""My legs felt like ice, like they didn't exist, until I tried to move. When I moved pain shot through me like a bomb going off."" Police arriving at the scene initially didn't know whether Mintz was the shooter or not. He explained that he'd been struck by the gunman's bullets and directed officers to the classroom where firing had been coming from. ""I don't recall a lot after that,"" he wrote. ""While still laying there, some students ran out of the classroom, some covered in blood ... A friend came out of the classroom and kneeled down beside me, traumatized and crying, I think she tried to pray with me, the only thing I could say was, 'It's my son's birthday"" [and] ""please call my son's mom and tell her, 'I can't pick him up from school today.'"" Mintz recalled that he recognized a friend who works as an EMT among one of the first responders on the scene of the mass shooting. ""I looked up and saw him walk up to the classroom door and said, 'hey, buddy.' He looked at me and responded, 'hey.' When I saw him, I KNEW WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE OK."" Mintz apologized for any pain caused to victims' families or survivors by his Facebook statement. But he added: ""I have to thank all the people who responded and everyone in the hospitals. THEY are the real heroes, they saved us."" Mintz was allowed to return home from the hospital six days after the Oct. 1 rampage, in which he was shot five times — leaving him with both legs broken.

http://www.nationalmemo.com/oregon-sheriff-wrote-gun-control-is-not-the-answer-and-residents-agree/,"By Marisa Gerber, Los Angeles Times (TNS) ROSEBURG, Ore. — Carolyn Kellim’s upper lip snarled to the left at the mention of gun control. “I think that’s the worst thing in the world that can happen,” said Kellim, 86, who runs KC’s Exchange gun shop out of her home. The words “2nd Amendment” are pasted in a decal onto her front door and there’s a Rifle Range Street nearby. In Roseburg, deer antlers line people’s driveways and locals hardly notice the pop-pop-pop of gunfire from nearby shooting ranges. “This is hunting territory,” Kellim said, smiling proudly. Her views about guns — and who should be able to buy them — didn’t change, she said, when a gunman shot and killed nine people and wounded at least nine others at Umpqua Community College not far from her home. In Connecticut, state leaders called for stricter firearm laws after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. People in Tucson rallied behind then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who became a loud supporter of gun reform after surviving a 2011 shooting at a grocery store. And when a 22-year-old man stabbed and shot several students in California’s Santa Barbara County last year, one of the victims’ fathers, who grew up hunting, went on every national TV station that invited him and begged for stricter gun laws. The tone in Roseburg is different. An ex-girlfriend of a surviving victim scoffed at the idea of tightening gun laws, and Kendra Godon, an elementary education student who hid from the shooting in a nearby classroom, said she hoped her community’s tragedy wouldn’t get spun into the national debate about firearms. “That’s not the issue,” she said. John Hanlin, Douglas County’s sheriff and the public face of the community since the shooting, is also an outspoken critic of increasing gun control. On his work biography, the broad-shouldered lawman who once attended Umpqua Community College lists three interests: fishing, riding his Harley and hunting. When Vice President Joe Biden asked for stricter gun laws after the Newtown killings, Hanlin decided to speak up. He wrote Biden a letter. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote in a letter posted on the Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page. He asked that Biden “NOT tamper with or attempt to amend the Second Amendment,” and informed the vice president he didn’t plan to enforce any laws he found unconstitutional. His deputies wouldn’t either. Around the same time, Hanlin — who keeps his gray hair cropped close on the sides and flat on top — shared a conspiracy theory video about the Sandy Hook shooting on his Facebook page. “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore … ,” the post read. “Watch, listen, and keep an open mind.” The post has been deleted and much of Hanlin’s account went private since the shooting, but the posting is saved in Internet archives. Asked about the video, the sheriff told CNN last week, “I know what you’re referring to, but that’s not a conspiracy theory that I have.” This spring, Hanlin testified before Oregon lawmakers about legislation requiring background checks for private gun sales. He argued that the measure — which has since become law — would keep guns from criminals about as much as laws keep methamphetamine out of the hands of drug addicts. “What I fear most,” Hanlin said, his face red, “is that we’re going to create criminals … out of some of our most ordinary, normal, law-abiding citizens.” Dennis Harper, 50, who works at an auto parts store near Umpqua Community College, said Hanlin’s views matched his own and those of most people in Douglas County. “He’s trying to protect everybody’s Second Amendment rights,” Harper said. “We’re in Oregon; that’s what we do.” At a prayer vigil Saturday, a local pastor said he was proud of Hanlin for leading a charge to avoid saying the shooter’s name. Several people in the crowd clapped and a woman shouted, “That’s my sheriff!” A sign outside a Roseburg barbershop read, “We stand with Sheriff Hanlin.” Since the shooting, Hanlin has steered clear of public critiques of gun control. Asked about his image as a Second Amendment advocate at a news conference Friday, Hanlin lowered his head. His lips tightened and he said his mind was consumed with the investigation. “Now is not an appropriate time to have those conversations,” he said. As Hanlin walked away, someone shouted one last question: “Sheriff, why does this keep happening in America?” Hanlin kept walking.

We refuse to let school shootings become an acceptable reality, and we will stop at nothing until our political leaders in Congress and in statehouses across the country stop asking students and teachers to stand up to gunmen so they don't have to stand up to the gun lobby. The rhetoric that nothing can be done is tired and wrong and pathetic. Obviously no one law will prevent every episode of gun violence, but we have a moral imperative to do more to protect our children from weak gun laws. And we will not let our children fall prey to gun laws dictated by the gun lobby that works toward putting more guns in more places with no questions asked. We must act to stop this carnage. While thoughts and prayers are needed and healing, the thoughts and prayers being offered in statements and on social media by pundits and lawmakers are not enough to stop the text messages that say, ""Mom, active shooter. Love you."" To drive real change on this issue, Americans must act, and we must act NOW. We must do more than posting about a shooting on social media. We must do more than say nothing will change or that stronger laws won’t work. Very simply, we must refuse to become numb to the gun violence that kills 88 Americans every single day and injures hundreds more. We must become educated about our state and federal gun laws. We must ask our elected officials, who are supposed to represent us, where they stand on guns. And we must hold them accountable for supporting stronger laws. Having founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America almost three years ago, I can tell you first-hand that since then, things are changing. Moms are fighting for sensible gun laws and policies, and we are winning. In the last three years, we've helped close background check loopholes in more than six states. We've pushed nearly a dozen states -- red and blue -- to pass laws that will help keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And we've influenced major restaurants and retailers -- like Starbucks, Chipotle and Target -- to adopt sensible gun policies to keep customers safe. RELATED: A common-sense conversation about guns and kids We're building consensus in the states and sending a strong message to elected officials that they’d better act according to the wishes of the majority of Americans, or fear the ballot box, because we will remember in November. Americans should be able to live their lives free from gun violence -- especially at school, where we send our kids off to learn and grow, not to risk their lives. We won’t have to live with bulletproof backpacks and lockdown drills and news headlines with the phrase “School Shooting” in them if we keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people to begin with.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-plots-his-exit-strategy," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Trump talks about possible exit from ’16 field… Just as his numbers decline a bit in new NBC/WSJ/Marist polls of Iowa, NH… More from our NBC/WSJ/Marist polls: Hillary leads in Iowa, while Sanders is ahead in the Granite State… What Clinton told Savannah Guthrie at this morning’s “Pancakes & Politics” town hall in Hollis, NH… Hillary unveils gun-control proposals… WaPo: Fiorina didn’t immediately pay staffers/consultants from her failed 2010 Senate run… The inevitable Bush vs. Rubio fight is here… And TPP agreement is reached -- which has big 2016 consequences. Trump talks about possible exit from ’16 field Donald Trump continues to lead the GOP presidential horserace -- see our new NBC/WSJ/Marist polls of the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But what happens if Trump suddenly exits the race in December or January? It’s not a far-fetched idea. “If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me 'cause you no longer have any interest in Trump because ‘he has no chance,’ I'd go back to my business. I have no problem with that,” Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” yesterday. Translation: If he’s not a sure bet to win the GOP nomination, he’ll get out, which would completely reshuffle the Republican race -- and which could benefit several different other Republican contenders. Jeb Bush? Marco Rubio? Ted Cruz? Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina? Trump replied on Twitter yesterday: “I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!” But notice that he didn’t deny this escape-hatch possibility. And it wasn’t the first time that he’s floated it, either (see his interview with CNBC’s John Harwood from last week). Just as his poll numbers decline a bit Trump’s declaration that he could possibly exit the GOP race comes as his poll numbers have declined, according to the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls we released yesterday. “In New Hampshire, Trump now holds a five-point advantage over Carly Fiorina among GOP primary voters, 21% to 16% -- followed by Jeb Bush in third at 11%, and Marco Rubio and Ben Carson tied at 10% each. But a month ago, Trump's lead over the nearest competition in the Granite State (John Kasich) was 16 points, 28% to 12%. And in Iowa, Trump is ahead of Carson by five points among potential GOP caucus-goers, 24% to 19% - with Fiorina in third at 8%, Bush at 7%, and Ted Cruz, Rubio and Bobby Jindal tied at 6%. A month ago, Trump's lead over Carson in Iowa was seven points in the same poll, 29% to 22%. Hillary leads in Iowa, while Sanders is ahead in New Hampshire Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls show that Hillary Clinton maintains her lead in Iowa, and Bernie Sanders is still ahead in New Hampshire. In Iowa, Clinton gets support from 47% of Iowa caucus-goers, while Sanders gets 36% and Martin O'Malley gets 4%. That's essentially unchanged from a month ago, when the poll showed Clinton ahead of Sanders by an identical 11 points, 48% to 37%. But Clinton's lead shrinks to five points when Vice President Joe Biden is added to the field -- Clinton at 33%, Sanders at 28% and Biden at 22%. And in New Hampshire, Sanders leads Clinton by nine points, 48% to 39%. That's essentially unchanged from a month ago, when Sanders was ahead 49% to 38%. Yet once again, Clinton loses ground when Biden is added to the contest -- Sanders sits at 42%, Clinton at 28% and Biden at 18%. In addition, the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls find that Sanders outperforms Hillary in hypothetical general-election matchups in these two battleground states. What Clinton told Savannah Guthrie So with Clinton trailing Sanders in New Hampshire, she sat down in the Granite State this morning for an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie -- and answered questions from town hall participants as part of “Today’s” Pancakes & Politics event. Asked by Guthrie about her poll standing in New Hampshire, Clinton answered, “I’ve got work to do in New Hampshire. I’m excited to be leading everywhere else… Bernie is a neighbor here; he represents Vermont.” Asked about her “SNL” appearance and why she often doesn’t come across as trustworthy and personable, Clinton replied that’s “not the nicest question” a politician wants to hear, because she believes she has a long record working for Americans. But she did admit that she’s a bit more reserved than some other politicians out there. And when Guthrie asked Clinton about her email controversy and if she’d be howling at Republicans for setting up their own private server, she fired back with this response: She never would have used a tragedy like the death of four Americans to make political hay. This is precisely why Kevin McCarthy’s comments from last week -- in which the likely next speaker of the House admitted that the Benghazi committee has set up to hurt Clinton’s poll standing -- were such a big deal. By the way, here’s our live blog of Hillary’s town hall event by NBC’s Carrie Dann. Hillary unveils gun-control proposals Also in New Hampshire today, Clinton is unveiling “a sweeping gun control proposal Monday that would include closing the ‘gun show loophole’ and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers, NBC’s Monica Alba reports. “Under the plan, which comes in the wake of a mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left 10 people dead last week, Clinton would tighten rules governing gun show and Internet sales using executive action ‘if Congress will not act,’ aides said. That includes the so-called gun show loophole, under which private gun sellers aren't required to perform background checks of buyers. She would also push to repeal a law backed by the National Rifle Association that prevents crime victims from suing gun manufacturers. And her proposal would revoke the licenses of ‘bad actor’ dealers who knowingly supply guns to straw purchasers and traffickers.” WaPo: Fiorina didn’t immediately pay staffers/consultants from her failed 2010 Senate run Turning to the rest of the 2016 field, don’t miss this tough Washington Post piece on Carly Fiorina: She didn’t pay some of her staffers from her failed 2010 Senate campaign. “Famed California pollster Joe Shumate was found dead in his home one month before Election Day 2010, surrounded by sheets of polling data he labored over for the flailing Senate bid of Carly Fiorina. Upon his death, Fiorina praised Shumate as ‘the heart and soul’ of her team. She issued a news release praising him as a person who believed in ‘investing in those he worked with’ and offering her ‘sincerest condolences’ to his widow. But records show there was something that Fiorina did not offer his widow: Shumate’s last paycheck, for at least $30,000. It was one of more than 30 invoices, totaling about $500,000, that the multimil­lionaire didn’t settle — even as Fiorina reimbursed herself nearly $1.3 million she lent the campaign. She finally cleared most of the balance in January, a few months before announcing her run for president.” The inevitable Bush vs. Rubio fight is here Don’t miss this piece by MSNBC’s Benjy Sarlin on the inevitable Bush vs. Rubio fight that has finally arrived. “Rubio, who has steadily improved in the polls since the last debate, is looking more and more like a threat to win the nomination as Bush’s campaign fails to reach escape velocity. Recognizing the danger, Bush has started to raise pointed questions about his old friend’s qualifications, portraying him as a promising protégé who needs more time in the minor leagues. Their jostling will likely determine who carries the establishment banner against Trump and outsiders like Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Ted Cruz.” TPP agreement is reached -- and it has big 2016 consequences Finally, here’s a significant development that will have 2016 consequences, per the Washington Post: “The United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations reached agreement Monday on the largest free-trade accord in a generation, an ambitious effort led by the Obama administration to knit together economies across a vast region. The deal capped more than five years of arduous negotiations on a project central to President Obama’s economic agenda and potentially hand him a legacy-defining victory late in his presidency.” The Washington Post adds that congressional ratification of the TPP trade accord will take place early next year -- just as the early presidential nominating contests begin.

A 5-month-old girl was shot to death while riding in a car with her mother in Cleveland. A man killed his wife and a good Samaritan then turned his gun on himself in north Florida. A security guard was allegedly killed by a co-worker in Atlanta. Teen-aged brothers were gunned down in broad daylight near a busy intersection in Fresno, California. A suspect in a Georgia shooting killed himself after a three-county car chase. The list of the Oct. 1 dead goes on and on: murders, suicides, workplace violence, domestic violence, street shootings, and drive-by gunfire. And there is nothing statistically unusual about it. RELATED: Gun control advocates: Don’t say nothing’s changed The most recent data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2013 an average of 92 people died in the United States each day of firearm-related injuries. Homicides accounted for about a third, and suicides most of the rest. More than twice as many are shot but survive. ""This is happening every single day in forgotten neighborhoods around the country,"" President Barack Obama said at a White House press conference Friday. The previous evening, reeling from news of a gunman's killing of nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Obama said the nation had become ""numb"" to gun violence. NBC News tracked down cases of two-dozen people who died from gun-related injuries on Thursday, the same day as the rampage in Oregon. Their stories portray a tragic, but perhaps typical, day in America. The victims included 5-month-old Aavielle Wakefield, who was riding in a car with her mother on Cleveland's east side Thursday night when a bullet, believed to have been shot from a nearby apartment building tore into her chest. She was the third fatal drive-by shooting of a child in the city in the past month, and her death nearly brought Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams to tears. ""We will stay on this as long as it takes,"" he said. ""We want bodies in jail tonight for this crime."" RELATED: The statistics surrounding gun violence in the US Williams said there were no leads yet in the investigation, in which prosecutors announced a $25,000 reward for information that leads to the killer's conviction. That same night, in Inglis, Florida, Walter Tyson, 57, allegedly opened fire on the lawn of a home, hitting his wife's boyfriend, Otis Ray Bean, police said. Bean survived. A good Samaritan, 68-year-old Walter Scott Terhune, tried to intervene, and Tyson shot him to death before entering the house and killing his wife, Patricia Tyson. Then the gunman shot himself. Much earlier, during the early morning shift at the Peachtree Tower apartments in the upscale Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, security guard Emmanuel Nwankwo, 23, was shot to death in the lobby. A fellow guard, 26-year-old Dexter Harper, was charged in the 5 a.m. killing. Later that morning, in Forsyth, Georgia, police found a man bleeding from several gunshot wounds. They chased the alleged shooter, Milton Terry Bowden, through three counties before forcing his car off the road. Officers then heard a single gunshot; Bowden had committed suicide. Around that time in Fresno, California, a shootout erupted in a busy intersection. Police arrived and found brothers Willie Ford, 19, and Denzel Ford, 18, dying from gunshot wounds. The motive, police said, was a falling out between the brothers and the 19-year-old gunman, who was arrested in a nearby apartment. That's just a small cross-section of Thursday's destruction, which also included young men shot dead on streets in Miami, St. Louis and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; a Pittsburgh kidnapping suspect who turned his gun on himself as police closed in on him; a bar fight in Toledo, Ohio; a murder-suicide in Cincinnati; and a suicide at an upstate New York gun range. On Friday, Williams, whose detectives are searching for whoever killed Aavielle Wakefield, urged the people of Cleveland to go beyond anti-violence marches and step forward to help find her killer, and those responsible for two recent drive-bys that claimed children. ""It's hard to stomach that,"" Williams said of the deaths. ""Because it's not for any reason that we can come up with.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/carson-media-blitz-surges-interest-and-controversy," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Dr. Ben Carson did more than a dozen interviews across major television networks, radio, and print outlets this week, opening himself up for the kind of non-stop media scrutiny the Republican presidential candidate has shied away from during much of his campaign for president, while stirring up to the very kind of controversy – and Hitler references – that characterized his rise to political prominence two years ago. The full-court press is ostensibly part of a book tour for his detailed campaign platform published on Tuesday, titled “A More Perfect Union: What We The People Can Do To Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.” It comes at a time when the presidential contender is polling in second, bested only by Donald Trump, the candidate who has dominated the media cycle for months by appearing on national television almost every day all summer. Carson’s biggest recent headline-maker was his argument that gun control enabled the slaughter of six million Jews in the Holocaust. RELATED: Ben Carson should probably stop talking about Hitler “The likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,” Carson told Wolf Blitzer on CNN on Thursday; he doubled down on the idea on MSNBC on Friday. The Anti-Defamation League swatted the idea down: “[G]un control did not cause the Holocaust; Nazism and anti-Semitism did.” While his campaign has thus-far focused largely on social media outreach and dogged early-state campaigning and advertising, this kind of media exposure, inflammatory remarks, and polarizing historical references is exactly what brought Carson a conservative following in the first place. When Carson’s argued that, for instance, Obamacare was the worst thing since slavery, or that America under the Obama administration's leadership bears similarities to Nazi Germany, it helped turn him into a conservative darling. Carson’s far-right stance on gun control was front page news the week. On Tuesday, he said he’d be more comfortable if kindergarten teachers were trained and armed in the classroom; on Wednesday, he said he’d have fought off the gunmen in a mass shooting situation like the one at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, which left 10 dead and another nine injured. He stuck these statements on Thursday, saying he hoped people remembered his encouragement to fight in future mass shootings. Some of his interviews were perplexing: at one point, he told reporters he’d actually been held at gunpoint but that he ""redirected"" the gunman; when reporters pointed to his interviews a day prior saying he’d fight off gunmen, he said it was different because his own brush with death was a hold-up. Still other statements Carson gave were just plain muddled, like when he appeared to mix up the debt ceiling and budgetary spending during his interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday. “I’m not going sign anything that in any way increases our obligations,” he said when asked how he’d handle the financial showdown Congress is heading into this fall. In recent years, Republicans have used the threat of a government default to try to force big budget cuts, a tactic Carson appeared to endorse. But he also suggested that if he were president, he would have prevented a debt ceiling fight entirely. “If I was president, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” he said. “I would have – long before we got to this stage – been looking at that and looking at other things because we always end up in the same situation. Your back’s against the wall, you got to do it right now or we’re going to die, you know – you know, it’s the same crap every year. Why do we keep doing it?” But interest in Carson (and his polling) seems to keep skyrocketing as he gains more exposure –  and as he continues to speak out boldly. According to Google Trends, interest in Carson spiked during both presidential debates and the last time he gave a slew of interviews, including one in which he said he wouldn’t support a Muslim president in late September. And over the last week as the candidate has upped his media presence even more (including an appearance on Charlie Rose's talk show Saturday and an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" coming this Sunday), searches for him have also increased. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oregon-shooter-plans-4chan_us_560da551e4b0768127016099?utm_hp_ref=4chan,"Reporter, HuffPost A comment on the web bulletin board 4chan eerily warned of a school shooting in the Northwest on Wednesday, prompting speculation that the gunman responsible for Thursday's mass shooting  at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College may have indicated he was planning the deadly attack the day before. “Some of you guys are alright,” an anonymous commenter wrote on 4chan’s /r9k/ board at around 5 p.m. EDT. “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. Happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning. So long space robots.” Many 4chan users replied to the original poster -- known as “OP” in 4chan lingo -- with encouragement. “DO IT,” an anonymous commenter replied. Another commenter gave detailed advice: “I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire.” The “OP” responded with gratitude and announced that he would be live-messaging his actions again on Thursday morning. “Thanks fam,” he offered. In response to the detailed instructions, he said, “Thanks. Keep me in your prayers.” It is not clear how seriously to take any of these comments. The threads, some excerpted below, contain explicit, often confrontational, language. 4chan users are known to joke about violence and other dark topics. They often pride themselves on being social misfits who can vent their frustration on the online platform. But the coincidental timing and specific nature of the message make it, as well as the comment thread, worth sharing. 4chan removed the comment thread from its site. 4chan’s rules forbid discussions or images that violate U.S. law. The site’s content moderators can remove posts or block users that they believe have violated the rules, but 4chan also regularly “prunes” old threads from the site. 4chan’s press office did not immediately respond to a request to confirm that it had removed the thread for violating the message board’s rules. There is no evidence of the new comment thread the user promised to post on Thursday morning. Authorities also appear to be unconvinced that the messages portended the attack. Law enforcement sources say they are skeptical that postings on 4chan regarding a shooting are connected to what happened today in Oregon. It is nearly impossible to confirm the identity of a 4chan user, since they have anonymity by default. They can choose a username if they want, but it is typically not a real name. In addition, only the site administrators know the user’s IP address. And even then, a skilled computer user could use a fake IP address. But it would not be unheard of for law enforcement to use 4chan content to identify or prosecute a murderer. Oregon police arrested David Kalac for murdering his girlfriend in November 2014, after Kalac posted photos of her on 4chan and implied that he would soon be shot and killed by police. Twitter users drew attention to the thread on Thursday as possible evidence of a warning from the shooter. Looks like the Oregon college shooter warned of his attack on 4chan's /r9k/ board the day before

 https://t.co/twnJ0DJV6s pic.twitter.com/eVCmqDjcfZ The news media soon followed up on the leads, asking notoriously insular and acerbic 4chan users for help identifying the murderer -- but they were, predictably, having none of it. 4chan users seemed to make the connection between the comment thread, however, continuing to respond to the original comment on an archived version of the thread on Thursday. They expressed surprise that the foretold attack had occurred. And their comments, whether sincere or intended as jokes, were mostly positive. “GOOD SHOW OP / MAY YOU RIP IN PEACE,” one anonymous commenter wrote. “THIS IS DAY A HISTORY REEEE,” a user named MC RIDE said.

When they had weapons, Jews could symbolically resist, as they did in the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and elsewhere, but they could not stop the Nazi genocide machine. In short, gun control did not cause the Holocaust; Nazism and anti-Semitism did."" Carson has come under fire repeatedly for his remarks on gun control this week. On Tuesday, he argued that he'd feel more comfortable if kindergarten teachers were armed and that victims should fight gunmen in mass shooting situations. “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson said in an interview on Fox News. ""I would say, hey guys, everybody attack him – he may shoot me but he can’t get us all.” RELATED: How Ben Carson reacted when held at gunpoint Carson's argument that the Holocaust was helped by gun control is laid out in a new book written by the candidate, released Tuesday. “Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance,"" Carson writes in “A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties."" Carson, who has risen to second in national polls of likely GOP voters, has also faced criticism for his views on the debt ceiling. In an interview with Marketplace earlier this week, the retired doctor seemed to confuse hiking the ceiling with the budget. Pressed by reporters on whether he would allow the government to default on its financial obligations, he pivoted back to saying that the United States must stop creating new debt in the first place. Speaking with Mitchell on Friday, Carson again focused entirely on spending when asked about the debt limit. ""I'm not going sign anything that in any way increases our obligations,"" he said when asked how he'd handle the debt ceiling showdown Congress is heading into this fall. In recent years, Republicans have used the threat of a government default to try to force big budget cuts, a tactic Carson appeared to endorse. But he also suggested that if he were president, he would have prevented a debt ceiling showdown entirely. “If I was president, we wouldn’t be in this situation,"" he said. ""I would have – long before we got to this stage – been looking at that and looking at other things because we always end up in the same situation. Your back's against the wall, you got to do it right now or we’re going to die, you know – you know, it’s the same crap every year. Why do we keep doing it?"" RELATED: Carson's 'learning curve' problem returns Carson is dominating the crowded Republican field, trailing only Donald Trump in national polls as the two campaign on bringing massive change to Washington. Both have made big promises about what they could do as leaders but struggle particularly on how they would make the numbers add up. Trump has promised a balanced budget, but his tax plan is estimated to add $12 trillion to the deficit and in the Marketplace interview, Carson was vague on how exactly he'd make the massive budget cuts he has promised. Asked whether he would run on the same ticket as Trump, either as vice-president or president, Carson said he couldn't answer yet, adding that he would consider ""compatibility issues"" and ""would consider everybody."" © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-unveil-plan-major-new-gun-restrictions," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton is set to unveil a sweeping gun control proposal Monday that would include closing the ""gun show loophole"" and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers. Under the plan, which comes in the wake of a mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left 10 people dead last week, Clinton would tighten rules governing gun show and Internet sales using executive action ""if Congress will not act,"" aides said. That includes the so-called gun show loophole, under which private gun sellers aren't required to perform background checks of buyers. RELATED: Nancy Pelosi calls for special House committee on gun violence She would also push to repeal a law backed by the National Rifle Association that prevents crime victims from suing gun manufacturers. And her proposal would revoke the licenses of ""bad actor"" dealers who knowingly supply guns to straw purchasers and traffickers. Clinton is expected to roll out her new plan Monday, starting with a town hall and interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie on TODAY in Hollis, New Hampshire. ""It's just heartbreaking, it is sickening to me to see another massacre.""' Clinton made an impassioned appeal for action Friday at Broward College in Davie, Florida, to counter the influence of the powerful NRA. ""What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?"" Clinton asked, vowing to ""fight for new, effective gun control measures"" as president. ""It's just heartbreaking, it is sickening to me to see another massacre. People should not have to be afraid to go to a college like this one or go to the movie theater or go to Bible study,"" she said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — who is leading Clinton in New Hampshire,according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll — has yet to roll out a gun control plan. After the Charleston, South Carolina, church shootings in June, Sanders issued a statement saying the ""killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation."" The statement notably did not mention guns. RELATED: GOP candidates' positions on guns unchanged after Oregon shooting After last week's shootings at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, however, Sanders released another statement pushing for ""sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them."" Sanders has a mixed voting record on gun legislation. He has voted to allow guns on Amtrak trains, but he also supported universal background checks after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Another Democratic presidential candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, called on Clinton and Sanders on Sunday night to back gun control provisions, including a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons. Clinton has repeatedly called out Republicans on gun control, saying their responses to mass shootings are ""infuriating."" ""Every time there's another massacre, Republicans and the NRA say 'now is not the time to talk about guns.' Yes, it is. But more than talk, it is time to act. But Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families,"" Clinton said. Clinton spoke similarly on gun control after two journalists were shot dead on live television in Virginia last month and often talks about the need for stricter gun laws on the campaign trail. On Friday, she urged: ""We don't just need to pray for people. We need to act. We need to build a movement."" This article first appeared at NBCNews.com © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Two days after drawing fire for suggesting victims of the Oregon community college shooting could have done more to fight back, Dr. Ben Carson recounted how when he was once held at gunpoint, he pointed the gunman in the direction of another target. “I have had a gun held on me, when I was at a Popeye’s organization,” Carson told Karen Hunter on Sirius XM Radio on Wednesday, describing a hold-up incident in Baltimore, where Carson worked for years as a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University. ""Guy comes in and puts the gun in my ribs and I just said, 'I believe you want the guy behind the counter.'"" RELATED: Ben Carson again directs victims to fight gunmen ""He said, 'oh, OK,' and went over there. I redirected him,"" Carson added. On Thursday, Carson went back on Sirius XM Radio and spoke again about the incident, saying that the hold-up wasn't the same as a mass shooting. “They’re very two — very different situations,” he said. “You’ve got a crazy person who is shooting people and is clearly going to continue to do that, versus somebody who is coming in to try to get a little bit of cash. Now, I’m not justifying the fact that he’s coming in to rob the place, but you’ve got to be able to distinguish between somebody who’s trying to rob a joint and somebody who’s trying to kill you.” The Republican presidential candidate's story comes amid backlash over comments he made Tuesday, when he told ""Fox and Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade that he would have attacked the gunman if confronted with a scenario similar to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College last week, which left 10 dead and nine injured. ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson said. ""I would say 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me but he can't get us all.'"" RELATED: Ben Carson advocates arming kindergarten teachers On Wednesday, he again reiterated the idea, saying he hoped people would take his suggestion to heart in future shootings. “I want to plant in people’s minds what to do in a situation like this because unfortunately this is probably not going to be the last time this happens,” Carson said of his controversial remarks.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-pressures-paul-ryan," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Pressure’s on Paul Ryan … If not him, they who? ... How many more chopped-off heads can there be in this congressional “Game of Thrones”? ... There’s just one “Young Gun” left -- Ryan … On Hillary, TPP, and the trust deficit… Another decision weekend for Biden … Update on the 3rd quarter money race … The dark-money 501c4 helping Marco Rubio … Carson defends Rupert Murdoch: “He’s not a racist” … Bloomberg doesn't 100% rule out a presidential bid … U.S. to scale back in Syria? ... And Bernie Sanders on “Meet” this weekend.” FIRST THOUGHTS. *** Pressure’s on Paul Ryan: As of this writing, there’s a very good chance we’ll see Rep. Paul Ryan, chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, relent and take the speaker’s job -- even if temporarily -- even though he and his office have tried to shut the door at every opportunity. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” this morning, Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) said he was fairly confident that Ryan would take the job. So why would Ryan take it, despite all of his earlier statements? It might come down to this: If not him, then who? But the window to pressure Ryan might be short -- if House Republicans don’t get him to acquiesce today, then there is the possibility he’s able to close the door once and for all. But as Ned Stark learned in “Game of Thrones,” sometimes your first instinct is the right one. As one Democratic aide told the New Republic’s Suzy Khimm, “The only good option [for Republicans] is Ryan and he is too smart to take the job,” likening the speakership to the king’s “hand” in “Game of Thrones.” The aide continued that Ned Stark didn’t want the job at first “because that guy always gets his head chopped off. They persuade him to take the job, and guess what? He gets his head chopped off.” *** But how many more chopped-off heads can there be? It’s worth pointing out: House Republican rebels and the House Freedom Caucus have now gotten three political scalps over the past year -- Eric Cantor (who lost his primary in 2014), John Boehner (who announced he’s stepping down two weeks ago), and Kevin McCarthy (who yesterday abandoned his bid to run for speaker). The House GOP’s original 1-2-3 are essentially gone. And this COULD be a blessing for Ryan (or whomever the next speaker is), because House rebels might simply get tired of collecting political scalps. Or do they? A final point here: Cantor, McCarthy, and Ryan were dubbed the “Young Guns” and even wrote a book together entitled: “Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders.” But there’s essentially only one “Young Gun” now left -- Paul Ryan. By the way, you may be asking why we keep writing about McCarthy in the past tense; after all, he said he plans to stay on as majority leader. It’s possible McCarthy can stay on as the No. 2, but many veterans in the House can’t figure out how McCarthy can still be effective in his job given all that has happened. Bottom line: Don’t assume McCarthy is out of the woods yet. *** On Hillary, TPP, and the trust deficit: For the second time in two weeks, Kevin McCarthy has bailed out Hillary Clinton -- first with his Benghazi committee comments, and second with his big news from yesterday, which stopped (temporarily) the focus on Hillary’s TPP flip-flop. But we want to make another point on that flip-flop: It’s a vulnerable time for Clinton to be adding to her trust deficit, especially with Tuesday’s debate coming up. The good news for Clinton: The email story has (mostly) been out of the news for her over the past couple of weeks. The bad news: This TPP flip-flop will be fodder at the upcoming debate. The New York Times’ David Brooks unloads on her. “This was not only a substantive flip-flop. It was so naked it amounted to a bold and clarion statement of faith on behalf of flip-flopping itself. It suggested a whole style of campaigning and method of governing based on the principle of unprincipledness.” Could this short-term gain with labor create long term pain for the general? *** Another decision weekend for Biden: As for Vice President Joe Biden, we keep running in the same place: Will he run or won’t he? The latest speculation comes from the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza, who reports that Biden associates met with the Democratic National Committee to go over delegate and calendar rules. (A DNC spokesperson would not confirm the news to NBC News.) But let’s cut to the chase: If a decision doesn’t come this weekend, it’s probably never going to come -- or if it does, Biden will be starting SO FAR behind, it might be impossible to catch up to Hillary Clinton or even Bernie Sanders. And progressives are beginning to grow tired of the Hamlet on the Potomac act. “[T]he game Joe Biden is playing now, in holding back on making his decision and telling us what he plans to do, just has to end, and fast. At best it’s becoming a farcical distraction that is beneath him. At worst it’s becoming a serious waste of our time,” writes the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent. Ouch. *** Update on the 3rd quarter money race: Turning to the 3rd quarter money race, we got new numbers yesterday -- $6 million raised for Marco Rubio and $12.2 million for Ted Cruz. Here’s where the 3rd quarter race stands for now: Here’s the question we have: Is Ted Cruz going to be second in the GOP field, outraising Jeb Bush? (We still don’t have Jeb’s actual 3rd quarter number). And here’s the follow-up question: Is Cruz maybe the most underrated candidate in the GOP field so far? *** The dark-money 501c4 helping Marco Rubio: As for Rubio’s money, don’t miss this piece by the AP: “The Florida senator is benefiting in unprecedented ways from a nonprofit group funded by anonymous donors. While other presidential candidates also have ties to secret-money groups, the Rubio arrangement is the boldest. Every pro-Rubio television commercial so far in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina has been paid for not by his campaign or even by a super PAC that identifies its donors, but instead by a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project. It's also sending Rubio-boosting mail to voters in those same states.” Per our ad-spending tracking, Conservative Solutions Project has spent nearly $5 million in the 2016 race. *** Carson defends Rupert Murdoch: “He’s not a racist”: In an interview with NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, Ben Carson responded to the tweet that media mogul Rupert Murdoch fired off on Wednesday, suggesting that President Obama is not a “real black” president, while Carson might be one. “Well, I know Rupert Murdoch. I can tell you he’s not a racist. You know, I don’t think he had any implications in a racist direction, and I think he’s simply saying that this president, who was the pride and joy of black Americans, has really not done a whole lot for black Americans. It probably could have been expressed in a different way.” *** Bloomberg doesn't 100% rule out a presidential bid: In an interview on MTP Daily, Chuck Todd asked former NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg if he would 100% rule out a presidential bid in 2016. He wouldn't. Bloomberg: ""I'm very flattered that people would ask, you would ask.  But the truth of the matter is, I'm very happy doing two things:  running my company and working with the United Nations and with the U.S. government on climate change.  And that's what we're here to talk about. Todd: Shermanesque? Bloomberg: Say again? Todd: Are you going to be Shermanesque about this? Bloomberg: Sherman? He was a general back in the Civil War, don't you remember that-- Todd: Look at you without the Shermanesque, though no Shermanesque? Bloomberg: You know, we've got to focus on climate change. Look, we don’t think Bloomberg will run. He’s a man without a party. But you can also tell he MIGHT still want to be part of the national debate. *** U.S. to scale back in Syria? That's what Bloomberg View's Josh Rogin and Eli Lake are reporting. “A week into Russia's military intervention in Syria, some top White House advisers and National Security Council staffers are trying to persuade President Barack Obama to scale back U.S. engagement there, to focus on lessening the violence and, for now, to give up on toppling the Syrian regime. In addition, administration officials and Middle East experts on both sides of the debate tell us, Obama's foreign-policy team no longer doubts that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to prop up President Bashar al-Assad and primarily target opposition groups other than the Islamic State, including those trained by the Central Intelligence Agency.” *** Bernie on “Meet” this weekend: Finally, on “Meet the Press” this weekend, NBC’s Chuck Todd will interview Bernie Sander.

Leigh Ann Caldwell takes a look at who might be next for the House Speaker slot after Thursday's chaotic withdrawal by Kevin McCarthy. National Review nicely sums up the Draft Paul Ryan movement. House Republicans will meet this morning to discuss the way forward. Here's what the stakes are, per the New York Times. More from POLITICO: ""As the full-court press for Ryan plays out, several other members also are considering bids for the top job. Georgia Republican Lynn Westmoreland and Texas Reps. Mike Conaway and Bill Flores are among the names that have been floated. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) also are continuing their bids for the speakership. Some lawmakers have called for a “caretaker” speaker to wield the gavel until after the 2016 election. Retiring Reps. John Kline of Minnesota and Candice Miller of Michigan were among the other lawmakers mentioned as possible interims for the assignment. But momentum for the “caretaker” idea had already begun to lose steam by late Thursday. Miller, for instance, said she wasn't interested in being interim speaker, and was against having a ""caretaker"" in the post, anyway."" The House Freedom Caucus has laid out its asks in exchange for support for a Speaker. The big picture, from Karen Tumulty in the Washington Post: ""Battalions of conservative ground troops have come to Capitol Hill in the past five years with expectations that were not in line with what could actually be achieved while there is still a Democrat in the White House. Disappointed in their ability to follow through on their campaign promises to turn back President Obama’s policies, they trained their fire on their own commanders."" OBAMA AGENDA: Heading to Oregon He's going to Oregon to visit victims of last week's community college shooting, but he'll encounter some anger and resistance there, writes the AP. ""In response to the latest mass shooting during his presidency, President Obama is seriously considering circumventing Congress with his executive authority and imposing new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers,"" writes the Washington Post. OFF TO THE RACES: Double-dipping between Hillary and Biden BIDEN: Some LGBT activists and big donors who were previously in Clinton's camp are gearing up to help Joe Biden. After the LA Times reported his unhappiness with the effort, the Draft Biden movement won't air its emotional ad about Joe Biden's personal loss. CARSON: He said that he has in fact had a gun pulled on him and that he ""redirected"" the assailant. Alex Jaffe reports on his efforts to clarify his confusing comments about the debt ceiling. CLINTON: The New York Times looks at her debate skills over the years. CRUZ: NBC's Hallie Jackson reports that Ted Cruz raised $12.2 million in 3Q. O'MALLEY: He's out with his vision for trade policy, with some slams at Hillary Clinton for her reversal on TPP. In the Cedar Rapids Gazette, he writes: ""The TPP is not, as some have called it, a “gold standard” deal. Instead, it is a story of winners and losers. Companies that support millions of American families, like those in the manufacturing industry — where good-paying jobs are disappearing at a faster rate than during the Great Depression — will see accelerating job losses and outsourcing.""

Hanlin clarified Friday that nine people were injured in the shooting spree. Officials said earlier that seven people were injured. Two of the victims were related to Douglas County EMS and fire personnel.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/assault-weapons-ban-us-supreme-court," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows The U.S. Supreme Court could announce as early as Tuesday whether it will hear a challenge to a suburban Chicago law banning firearms commonly known as assault weapons. If the court agrees to hear the case, it would cast a shadow over similar bans in seven states. But declining to take it up would boost efforts to impose such bans elsewhere, at a time of renewed interest in gun regulation after recent mass shootings. Gun rights advocates are challenging a 2013 law passed in Highland Park, Illinois, that bans the sale, purchase, or possession of semi-automatic weapons that can hold more than 10 rounds in a single ammunition clip or magazine. In passing the law, city officials cited the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The ban also lists certain specific rifles, including those resembling the AR-15 and AK-47 assault-style firearms. Semi-automatic weapons are capable of shooting a single round with each pull of the trigger and, consequently, can fire rapidly. Large capacity magazines reduce the need to reload as often. A federal district judge upheld the law, and so did a federal appeals court panel by a 2-1 vote. Central to the dispute is the Supreme Court's 2008 ruling that, for the first time, said the Constitution's Second Amendment provides an individual right to own a handgun for self-defense. While it was a watershed ruling for gun rights, it also said ""dangerous and unusual weapons"" can be restricted. The firearms banned by the Highland Park ordinance may be common, the appeals court said. But it added that ""assault weapons with large-capacity magazines can fire more shots, faster, and thus can be more dangerous in the aggregate. Why else are they the weapons of choice in mass shootings?"" The opinion, written by Judge Frank Easterbrook, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said that ""a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines might not prevent shootings in Highland Park (where they are already rare), but it may reduce the carnage if a mass shooting occurs."" The Illinois State Rifle Association, which is challenging the law's constitutionality, says the weapons are in no way unusual. The AR-15, the group says, is the best-selling rifle type in the nation. Between 1990 and 2012, the group says, more than 5 million AR-type rifles were manufactured for sale in the U.S., and 3.4 million more were imported. As for the magazines, the gun rights group says they are ""ubiquitous,"" with nearly 75 million of them in possession of gun owners. In a friend of court brief urging the Supreme Court to take the case, lawyers for 24 states say the weapons banned by the Highland Park ordinance are not only commonly used, but are also protected by state laws that forbid local communities to restrict them. A ruling striking down the city ordinance would undercut similar bans in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, and in Chicago and surrounding cities.

And their positions are not much different than after previous mass shootings. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who once received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association for supporting the 1994 assault weapons ban, told NBC News that ""stripping law abiding people of their guns … I don't believe will get the job done."" Dr. Ben Carson said Friday in Iowa said early warning systems that identify a possible culprit need to be put in place. ""You're not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal law abiding citizens. It doesn't work for crazies,"" Carson said. RELATED: Kasich: ‘Stripping’ people of their guns won’t help On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Donald Trump called the situation ""horrible"" and noted that school shootings are ""sort of unique to this country"" but said inferred that there's not much that can be done. ""So it's a terrible situation, it's a huge mental illness. You're going to have these things happen and it's a horrible thing to behold,"" Trump said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in Iowa that ""there's really no evidence that these gun laws would prevent these shootings."" While campaigning in South Carolina, which witnessed the Charleston mass shooting, Carly Fiorina said that ""before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have."" She points to the fact that the college was a gun free zone and the individual who committed the crime didn't abide. Fiorina also called President Barack Obama's remarks after the shooting ""premature at best and at worst a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy."" President Obama gave an impassioned news conference Thursday where he said, ""I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue - fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?"" ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama added. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton told Boston NBC affiliate WHDH that the shooting ""raises the urgency of the issue of gun control for me."" Enough is enough and the vast majority of Americans and even the majority of gun owners believe we should have universal background checks.""

Google Trends data showed on Monday that despite a sharp spike in searches for ""gun control"" following the mass shooting, interest has essentially petered out. Queries for ""gun control"" on Google, the world's most popular search engine, soared on Oct. 2, one day after the Oregon shooting. Google gives a relative estimate about search popularity on a scale of 0-100. According to data for the month of October, searches for ""gun control"" reached their peak of 100 on Oct. 2. Then, the trend started to fade. There was a slight uptick to 52 this past Friday, when there were two more shootings on college campuses, but interest has fallen. Put a different way, there was about half as much interest in ""gun control"" when the second and third school shootings of the month happened, compared to that first massacre. It's a predictable pattern at this point. Last year, a shooter went on a murdering spree in California on May 23. Search interest in ""gun control"" peaked, and then it fell. On Jan. 10, 2013, a student opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun in a high school science classroom. Interest in ""gun control"" soared on Google. Then it dissipated. As for the prevailing American attitude on guns this year overall: Searches for ""gun shop"" have been far more popular than searches for ""gun control."" The usual caveats apply here: We can't really draw conclusions about overall public attitudes based on Google searches. But we can understand what people are looking for more information on -- and we can see when people begin to lose interest. It's possible that all of the outrage over gun violence this month translated into a surge of Google searches for ""gun control"" that immediately resulted in direct advocacy of and donations to anti-gun groups. Or that the search term became less popular because people simply didn't need the information anymore. More likely, ""gun control"" is just the flavor of the week, as we've seen so many times before.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-jeb-bush-was-talking-about-when-he-said-stuff-happens," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows GREENVILLE, South Carolina—Jeb Bush said calls for sweeping government rules and regulation often follow tragedies like the mass shooting this week in Oregon, but that such responses aren't always focused on the correct challenge. ""It's just heartbreaking to see these things,"" referring to Thursday's mass shooting, ""but this is -- this is the broader question of rule-making."" ""What we end up doing lots of times is we create rules on the 99.999% of human activity that had nothing to do with the tragedy that had forced the conversation about doing something,"" Bush said. ""Stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do,"" he added. RELATED: Obama: Inaction on gun violence is a political decision Bush made the comments during a broad conversation about the Constitution at an event in South Carolina where he emphasized the importance of protecting personal liberty, even after tragedy. He later clarified that his comments on limiting liberty were not directly related to the events in Oregon but a more general commentary on public tendency. ""Yeah, not related to Oregon,"" he said, adding, ""Just clarity here. Let’s make sure we don’t allow this to get out of control. There are all sorts of things that happen in life. Tragedies unfold. Look, just read the papers, and you see a child dies in a poll, is drowned, and parents want to pass a law to do something. And you got to be careful that you want to solve the problem. If there is a problem, a defect in the law, fine, then we did that all the time. But sometime you’re imposing solutions to problems that doesn’t fix the problem and takes away people’s liberty and rights and that’s the point I was trying to make."" As he has done after past shootings, Bush focused the cause more on mental health problems of a few rather than gun control for the many. ""No gun law necessarily is going to be able to deal with that, that is a sick person where there was no intervention in their lives to get them on the right course."" The Republican candidate said his philosophy on this issue is similar to his entire constitutional view which he said focuses on ""the bottom up"" with deference to states over the federal government. ""Maybe we ought to be more connected in our communities, maybe we ought to have a greater awareness of the mental health challenges that exist all across this country,"" he said. ""Maybe there's a better way to deal with this."" Asked about Bush's comments at a news conference Friday afternoon, President Barack Obama said, ""I don't even think I have to react to that one, I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting ... and they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening.'"" Responding to criticism, Bush's campaign issued the following statement late Friday: “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions.” This article first appeared at NBCNews.com © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gavin-newsom-california-gun-safety-ballot-initiative," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows In an effort to circumvent the national gun lobby’s reach and “go directly to the public,” California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom -- who is running for governor of the Golden State -- on Thursday announced a sweeping proposal for next year’s ballot that could potentially set a gold standard for enacting gun control. “If we continue to fight the National Rifle Association on their home court, which is the legislative front, I think we’ll continue to be frustrated,” the rising Democratic star said in a phone interview with MSNBC Thursday. “But when you have an ability to go directly to the public, that’s a completely different field of engagement, and I think the NRA is not adept at that kind of engagement. They are significantly hindered because public opinion is not with them.” “If we continue to fight the National Rifle Association on their home court, which is the legislative front, I think we’ll continue to be frustrated.""' The ballot initiative, if adopted, would make California the first state in the nation to implement background checks for ammunition sales, requiring someone buying bullets to undergo the same level of scrutiny as someone buying a gun. It would also require gun owners to get rid of their large-capacity magazines -- the manufacture and sale (but not the possession) of which are already prohibited under California law -- as well as report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement. Many of the initiative’s provisions were recently proposed by California lawmakers, but either failed to pass the Democratic-controlled legislature, or were vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. “A mistake that a lot of us have made, related to those who advocate for gun safety legislation, is that we try to process it through our legislative bodies, and that’s where the NRA’s strength lies,” Newsom said. “There’s been a gap between perception and reality, the perception being that California is on the cutting edge of gun safety legislation when, in fact, there are a number of areas where we have fallen behind.” RELATED: Clinton, Sanders spar over guns Newsom’s proposal, which he formally unveiled Thursday at the site of a 1993 mass shooting in San Francisco, comes in the wake of several high-profile killings by gunfire, two of which took place in the Golden State. In 2014, a 22-year-old gunman went on a shooting rampage in Isla Vista, California, killing six people before taking his own life. And over the summer, a San Francisco woman named Kathryn Steinle was shot and killed with a gun that was found to have been stolen from a federal agent. Police have charged an undocumented immigrant with Steinle’s murder, prompting GOP lawmakers to seize on the case as evidence of the need for tougher immigration laws. Next week, the Senate is scheduled to vote on “Kate’s Law,” a measure named after Steinle that would impose a mandatory-minimum five-year prison sentence for any undocumented immigrant who reenters the U.S. after being deported. But while Newsom believes Steinle’s death illustrates the need for comprehensive immigration reform, he also feels the conversation needs to be about guns. “At the end of the day, there’s not a day that goes by without a mass shooting,” Newsom said, referring to data compiled by the Mass Shooting Tracker. “I’m a parent. The embers of this whole effort come from my own frustration and, frankly, my own accountability.” Newsom’s proposal also comes at a time that many gun control advocates believe to be a tipping point for nationwide reform. The issue featured prominently in this week’s Democratic presidential debate, with front-runner Hillary Clinton going after her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, for not being tough enough on guns. Additionally, in the past two years, six states have closed loopholes that allowed for gun purchases without background checks — bringing to 18 the total number of states that now require background checks for some or all private firearm sales. Two more states, Nevada and Maine, look poised to follow. “I would like to believe that we’re getting closer to that tipping point,” Newsom said. “I’m more optimistic now because it’s a bottom-up approach. These reforms are not going to emanate out of a Congress that is made up of intimidated politicians. But it’s much harder to intimidate the public than it is to intimidate a politician.” RELATED: Donald Trump: 'I feel much better being armed' California already has some of the nation’s toughest gun restrictions, including a 1999 ban on assault weapons, like the AK-47. The same law also bans the importation, manufacture and sale of ammunition magazines with 11 rounds or more. But the ballot initiative goes considerably further, requiring owners of large-capacity magazines to sell them to a licensed firearms dealer, take them out of state, or turn them over to law enforcement for destruction. It would also set up a process for felons to relinquish their weapons, and require the California Department of Justice to report to the federal instant criminal background check According to a poll conducted last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, 65% of adults said that laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter. “I’m a parent. The embers of this whole effort come from my own frustration and, frankly, my own accountability.”' The measure needs 365,000 signatures to qualify for next year’s ballot -- the means by which many of California’s most impactful proposals are adopted. High-profile ballot initiatives also play an important role in the state’s elections, with candidates’ seeking to capitalize on the visibility their measures often bring. Newsom, who could also be heavily involved in the initiative to legalize marijuana, launched a fundraising committee earlier this year to run for governor in 2018. Whatever the political motivations behind Newsom’s gun safety proposal, however, they appear to be secondary to his moral ones. Throughout the interview, he repeatedly referred to emotional remarks that President Obama delivered two weeks ago, after a lone gunman shot and killed nine people at a community college in Oregon. “We collectively are answerable to those families,” Obama told a roomful of reporters in the White House briefing room. Echoing that sentiment, Newsom said: “I can’t be part of the problem anymore.” © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Medicaid expansion was always the public health cornerstone of ACA. It remains the single most important measure to expand access to mental health and addiction treatment, serving severely vulnerable populations such as the homeless, addressing the complicated medical and psychiatric difficulties of many young men cycling through our jails and prisons. In 2013, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) released a report endorsing Medicaid expansion. The report argued that ""States that decline to expand Medicaid will miss as good an opportunity as they may ever have to address this shameful void in access to mental health treatment."" Addressing the connection between mental illness and violence, NAMI concluded: ""In the aftermath of Newtown, many politicians and policy makers have promised to take steps to fix America's broken mental health system. Expanding Medicaid in all states would represent a significant step towards keeping those promises."" © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/117634291/0/alternet_all~Times-the-Onion-Brilliantly-Skewered-Our-Insane-Politics,"So much of our dumb cultural, political and social lives are just begging to be satirized. So in 1988, that’s exactly what the Onion started doing, launching a small weekly newspaper out of Madison, Wisconsin. From its humble beginnings, the satirical news site has grown into a media titan in its own right and serves as the direct antecedent of programs like the ""Daily Show"" and countless imitators such as the Daily Currant. The print edition is no more, but its multiple websites – including the “news” pages, video channels (including TED spoof “Onion Talks""), the A.V. Club, and ClickHole (aka the Onion does Buzzfeed) – attract 30 million unique visitors each month. Somehow, it’s not only kept its wits intact through all that growth, but its keen satirical eye has only grown sharper. Wrangling the best political pieces from the Onion is pretty much an impossible task – there’s just too much good there to reduce it to a reasonably sized list. But we do have some favorites, nonetheless. Out of an almost limitless supply, here are just 16 of the Onion’s best political pieces. 1. ‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens After the mass shooting in Oregon earlier this month, the Onion quietly reposted this article. It had run twice before: once after the racially motivated shooting in Charleston that left nine dead and, before that, after a mass shooting at the University of California in which seven were killed. On its own, it’s a fairly sublime bit of satire. But by posting the story repeatedly – to show how the details change with each tragic mass shooting, yet the circumstances remain the same – it’s an even more powerful indictment of our culture of gun violence and our country's refusal to do anything about it. 2. NRA Calls For Teachers To Keep Loaded Gun Pointed At Class For Entire School Day (Oct. 24, 2013) After the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012, National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre blamed the shooting on video games, music videos and “[p]eople...driven by demons” – but not, curiously, guns. In fact, LaPierre suggested what we need is more of those, and called on Congress to “put armed police officers in every single school in this nation.” This Onion article ran nearly a year later, after a 2013 Nevada school shooting – the 15th that year – left two injured and two dead. It effectively encapsulates the ridiculousness of the NRA position, and imagines La Pierre saying things you probably shouldn’t put past him in real life. (“The only way to ensure safety in our schools is to make sure teachers hold fully loaded firearms at students from the moment they walk into the classroom until the moment they leave.”) 3. New 'Anti-Abortion Pill' Kills Mother, Leaves Fetus Alive (May 10, 2006) Finally, a pill that anti-reproductive justice activists will love. The Onion skewers not only the palpable misogyny of so much anti-abortion legislation, but also mocks the men who have so much to say about women having a say in what happens with their own bodies. ""This is a step forward for equality,"" a men's rights activist says. ""For too long, women have had an unfair advantage in the outcome of a pregnancy. UR-86 levels the playing field for husbands and boyfriends across America."" 4. New Law Requires Welfare Recipients To Submit Sweat To Prove How Hard They’re Looking For Job (Aug. 6, 2014) Despite all the evidence showing most welfare recipients are working poor, conservatives continue to push the idea that federal aid flows to the lazy and entitled. That way, instead of addressing issues of real consequence, conservatives can waste time and money on bills that serve no purpose other than making it even harder to be poor in this country. In an era in which more and more states are passing laws forcing welfare recipients to be drug-tested (and Kansas has even prohibited welfare recipients from using funds to “visit swimming pools [or] see movies”), reality is only slightly less ridiculous than satire. 5. Judge Rules White Girl Will Be Tried As Black Adult (Jan. 22, 2011) A pretty brilliant satirical take on a devastating truth. In this Onion News Network clip, a blonde teenager collapses into tears when a judge hands down the “harshest possible sentencing from the judge”: being tried as a black adult. “We’re going to do our best to make sure that Hannah is treated with the sympathy and sensitivity that she as a photogenic white girl deserves,” the teen’s mother tells the press after they exit the court. “This is America,” her father adds. “Nobody deserves to be treated as a black man.”  6. Drugs Win Drug War (Jan. 10, 1998) Before America conceded that the war on drugs has been a colossal failure, the Onion was already declaring the U.S. had long lost the battle. Bonus points to this vintage article for its photo, which features then-Clinton drug czar Barry McCaffrey holding a press conference with two of “the nation’s stoners” – one lighting a bong and both wearing tie dye – who will be assuming power. 7. Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job (Nov. 4, 2008) Immediately after Barack Obama’s election, the Onion posted this article that played with the topic of race and foresaw the issues awaiting America’s first black president. “In his new high-stress, low-reward position, Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation's broken-down economy, repairing the crumbling infrastructure, and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis.” 8. ‘98 Homosexual-Recruitment Drive Nearing Goal (July 29, 1998) Way back in the late 1990s, the Onion was making fun of the conservative belief that most gays have dedicated their lives to spreading “the homosexual lifestyle.” Straight out of some paranoid homophobic nightmare, the Onion reports that the National Gay & Lesbian Recruitment Task Force is having unprecedented success with it's topsy-turvy conversion therapy. Fred Phelps, the late head of the Westboro Baptist Church, actually mistook this article for a real news item and posted it on his website to warn followers about the out-of-control gay menace. 9. Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over’ (Jan. 17, 2001) Within a few years of Bush’s election, this Onion article would seem almost eerily prescient, so accurately did it nail how 43’s term in office would look. ""You better believe we're going to mix it up with somebody at some point during my administration,"" a newly elected Bush says. ""Unlike my predecessor, I am fully committed to putting soldiers in battle situations...We must squander our nation's hard-won budget surplus on tax breaks for the wealthiest 15 percent. And, on the foreign front, we must find an enemy and defeat it."" 10. Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex (May 18, 2011) The Onion turns the conservative fever dream of Planned Parenthood as an abortion wonderland into a reality. Despite totally unbelievable details like the organization changing its slogan to “No Life Is Sacred” and a description of the Abortionplex as a “state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility” housing 2,000 rooms where abortions are performed, Republican Congressman John Fleming bought the story hook, line and sinker. Fleming posted it to his Facebook wall, where several people pointed out that the Onion is a satirical site. Elsewhere on the Internet, hundreds of users who got the joke have posted (mostly glowing) reviews of the Abortionplex on a Yelp page dedicated to the fictitious site. 11. Ho, Ho, Ho! 9/11 Was An Inside Job! (Dec. 12, 2012) Rounds up every 9/11 conspiracy theory bit of “evidence” into an article from Santa Claus, who insists on making sure all of America’s little boys and girls know they’ve been duped. “The type of steel they used melts at a temperature of about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, and as I'm sure all you smart little boys and girls know, jet fuel burns at 1,500 degrees, tops,” Santa explains. Sits somewhere between embracing the paranoia and foreshadowing all those 9/11 truther memes. 12. U.S. Flag Recalled After Causing 143 Million Deaths (April 13, 2010) Ronald Burman, the Onion’s fictional president of the flag manufacturer that issued the recall, sums up the problem with America’s flag. ""Unfortunately, the practical applications of this product are far outnumbered by the risks it presents. Millions have died needlessly, and when you ask people why, they point to the flag...When combined with alcohol, excessive patriotism, grief, or well-intentioned but ultimately misguided ideals, U.S. flags transform into ticking time bombs, just waiting to go off.” 13. Marauding Gay Hordes Drag Thousands Of Helpless Citizens From Marriages After Obama Drops Defense Of Marriage Act (Feb. 25, 2011) What better way to point out the absurdity of the idea that marriage equality is a threat to “traditional marriage” than to imagine gays on a rampage after DOMA’s repeal. The headline says it all, but the piece goes on to paint a scene in which “roving bands of homosexuals” terrorize straights, dragging “helpless Americans...from their marital unions.” Somewhere, someone’s great aunt is pasting this article into a group email as we speak. 14. Income Inequality Emerges As Key Topic To Avoid In 2014 Elections (May 5, 2014) As the New Yorker notes, “[i]ncome inequality is greater in the United States than in any other democracy in the developed world.” The disparity between those with the most and pretty much everyone else has been steadily widening over the last few decades, with no sign of change in the foreseeable future. It’s a highly relevant topic and, as the Onion points out, one most politicians will do their absolute best to avoid. “The well-documented and steadily increasing gap between the rich and poor has come to the fore as the hot-button issue that all congressional candidates will be dodging at town halls, in televised debates, and at voter meet-and-greets in 2014,” the publication has one political analyst state. 15. Candidate Turns To Focus Group For Position On Rape (Aug. 15, 2011) Cowardly politicians are always a worthy target, and the Onion puts them in its satirical crosshairs with regularity. But what’s also notable about this particular piece is that it ran almost exactly a year before Republicans really started turning up the crazy in discussions about rape, a stretch that kicked off in 2012 with Todd Aiken’s “legitimate rape” comments. In any case, like so many Onion articles, it’s even more relevant today. 16. Experts Point To Long, Glorious History Of Successful U.S. Bombing Campaigns (Aug. 27, 2013) Another story where the headline really says it all, but the article deserves a read, too. Mostly for gems like this: “The record clearly shows that, in every instance since the Second World War in which the U.S. government has launched strategic missile attacks on foreign soil, our military forces easily targeted enemy assailants with total precision, leaving no civilian casualties, collateral damage, or any long-term negative consequences for the affected country or region, American foreign policy, or international relations as a whole.”   So do we.

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bush-struggles-carson-and-trump-jostle-conservative-dominance," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows With the October 28 Republican debate right around the corner, the GOP field looks much like it did heading into the last debate six weeks ago. Donald Trump is in front, Ben Carson looks like a force as well, and Jeb Bush is still stuck in the middle of the pack fending off threats on all sides. Six weeks closer to the primaries, however, these trends all have taken on greater urgency. Establishment Republicans are no longer so sure Trump is a passing fad. Carson has survived – and even thrived – after a flood of scrutiny over remarks questioning Muslim citizens’ loyalty and claiming armed Jews could have potentially stopped the Holocaust. Now Bush’s lag in the polls is threatening to become a full-blown crisis that could topple his campaign before it ever gets off the ground. On Friday, Bush’s campaign announced it would be making dramatic cuts to spending and payroll after a disappointing fundraising quarter that saw its $13.4 million haul outpaced by Carson’s $20 million. Candidates like Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz accrued similar cash reserves and are looking more and more like potential nominees.  Bush is in single digits in national polls of Republican voters and looks just as weak in New Hampshire, where the campaign desperately needs a strong performance. Related: Donald Trump won't apologize to Ben Carson for religion comment Bush dismissed speculation his campaign was in danger of collapse with a “blah blah blah” at a South Carolina event on Saturday. But he acknowledged that the campaign made adjustments in part due to Trump’s staying power, which has caught many Republican strategists by surprise. Bush, who pledged before he ran to carry out a “joyful” campaign, warned voters on Saturday that Trump’s combative approach would guarantee further gridlock and division. ""I've got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them,"" Bush said. ""That's a joke. Elect Trump if you want that."" After a brief dip following last month’s debate, Trump’s lead in national polls has rebounded and many Republican voters now say he’s the most electable candidate. Some strategists are warning that Republican donors may have to target Trump with outside attack ads or risk handing him the nomination given the ineffectiveness of other candidates’ efforts so far. “Trump has yet to be tested by a barrage of attacks to his lack of record and flip flops,” Republican strategist Brad Blakeman told MSNBC. “I suspect he will behave badly when attacked. “ So far Trump has proven immune to the kinds of gaffes and inconsistencies that have single-handedly wrecked campaigns in the past. In a town hall with NBC's ""TODAY"" on Monday, he recounted his wealthy background in terms that would have caused the similarly privileged Mitt Romney an endless headaches in 2012 had he said the same. “It has not been easy for me,"" Trump said. ""I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars."" Trump seems far less concerned about Bush right now than Carson, who two respected pollsters showed moving into a lead in Iowa last week. Trump is still ahead in national polls and recent surveys of other early primary states, but being behind anywhere is a new phenomenon for the candidate and his campaign has not taken to it well so far. The billionaire’s Twitter account retweeted a supporter who mocked Iowans as brain-damaged corn eaters. The campaign deleted it shortly afterwards and Trump said a “young intern” was responsible for the mistake. As outsider candidates frequently accused of flouting political decorum, Carson and Trump have much in common and have mostly (but not always) avoided attacking each other. That’s changing fast now as Trump grapples with Carson’s momentum. Over the last few days, Trump has mocked the soft-spoken Carson as “super low” on energy, reviving an attack he used to great effect against Bush. Carson’s camp responded that they’d like to see Trump perform an 18-hour brain operation, as the neurosurgeon Carson has. Treading into more sensitive territory, Trump also appeared to raise doubts about Carson’s religion this week. After previously suggesting Carson’s faith was for show, Trump pivoted to instead implying Carson’s Seventh-day Adventist church was extreme. “I'm Presbyterian,” Trump said in Florida on Saturday. “Boy, that's down the middle of the road folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about.” In a phone interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” the next day, Trump denied there was anything sinister in the remark – he merely was “not that familiar” with Carson’s religion. Carson has risen in the polls recently despite – or arguably because of – a series of incendiary culture war fights reminiscent of Trump’s early days. Over the last month, Carson argued that victims of a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon should have more aggressively confronted the killer and that Jews might have prevented the Holocaust if Germany had looser gun control laws, a claim wildly at odds with mainstream historians that drew condemnations from Jewish groups. This week, he likened women who sought abortions to slave owners in their disregard for life. After decrying criticism of his views as “political correctness,” Carson spent Sunday defending a plan to police speech in academia by cutting off federal funding to institutions where professors showed “extreme political bias.” “The way that works is you invite students at the universities to send in their complaints, and then you investigate,” Carson told “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd. Carson’s rhetoric plays well in Iowa, where Republicans have tended to support socially conservative candidates willing to inflame liberal critics. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who won in 2008, both fit the bill although neither went on to win the nomination nor have they gained much traction in the current runs. “I think Carson and Trump are going to be a factor until the end for two entirely different reasons: Trump by the sheer power of his personality and his ability to gain earned media and Carson because of the strength of his ground game,” Chuck Muth, a Republican consultant who has worked with a pro-Carson super PAC, told MSNBC. The big question is whether Carson or Trump or another insurgent like Cruz becomes the latest populist insurgents to see their campaign quashed by more mainstream candidates in the later states or whether the party’s changed sufficiently to give them a serious shot at the nomination. For now, more establishment Republicans can take solace in that history, but every day their confidence seems to erode that much more. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

On Monday, he wrote on Facebook, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday, he appeared on Fox & Friends, where he seemed to suggest that the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting should have responded differently to the heavily armed gunman. “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,” Carson said. “I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'” (Carson was apparently unaware of the story of Chris Mintz, an army veteran who did block the door between the shooter and a classroom full of people, suffering several gunshot wounds and two broken legs in the process.) On Wednesday, Carson doubled down on these controversial comments in an interview with CBS This Morning. “I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time,” he said. “That way, we don’t all wind up dead.” That brings us to Wednesday evening, when Carson appeared on a radio show and described an actual episode in which he was faced with a gunman. In Carson’s telling, he responded quite differently in this real-life scenario than he said he would have reacted if faced with a possible shooter. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye’s in Baltimore,” Carson told Sirius XM’s Karen Hunter. “[A] guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, ‘I believe you want the guy behind the counter.'” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Twittersphere pounced: @drewmagary Ben Carson at Ford’s Theater: “HE’S the President Mr. Booth” — Steak Knives (@Josh1938) October 8, 2015  It makes you wonder what Carson really would have done had he been in that classroom, staring down the barrel of a gun. Clearly, he would definitely not “just stand there.”  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/425329/ben-carson-half-right-about-guns-and-holocaust-charles-c-w-cooke,"Follow Us National Review A Telling Anecdote from Clarence Thomas 30 Years of Justice Clarence Thomas BREAKING: Supreme Court Sets November 1 Oral Argument on Texas Abortion Case Americans Should Be More Upset about Infrastructure Inefficiency What You Missed Last Night Ben Carson has upset everyone again: Ben Carson said Thursday that Adolf Hitler’s mass murder of Jews “would have been greatly diminished” if German citizens had not been disarmed by the Nazi regime. The comment, which came during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, was similar to arguments Carson made following last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in which he defended the Second Amendment and suggested that the victims should have fought the gunman. . . . “I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,” Carson said. Blitzer pushed a bit more: “Because they had a powerful military machine, as you know, the Nazis.” “I understand that,” Carson said. “I’m telling you that there is a reason that these dictatorial people take the guns first.” Before getting into the details of this claim, I must confess to being unsure as to why the mere mention of this era offends people as keenly as it does. In his comments, Carson was presenting a counterfactual hypothesis. Maybe it’s a bad one and he’s wrong. Maybe it’s a good one and he’s right. But why the anger? If you don’t like his case — or you think it’s stupid — then explain why he’s incorrect. Don’t freak out just because he said the word “Nazi.” Godwin’s law exists to mock those who refer to the Third Reich when it doesn’t apply. It’s not a general prohibition on the discussion of Nazism. Now, is Carson incorrect? Possibly, yes. It is true that the Nazi regime disarmed the Jews — and to the extent that it prohibited them from owning even knives. That fact, though, does not in and of itself mean that the Holocaust could have been prevented. Given what I know about the sentiments held by the population at large and about the remarkable efficiency of both the military and the police, it seems unlikely to me that any organized resistance could have prevailed — at least not to the extent that it could have overthrown the German state or facilitated the escape of millions of people. Unlike during the American revolution, there was no strong undercurrent of liberalism that undercut the efforts of the authorities, and, besides, many of those who were exterminated didn’t know what was happening to them until it was too late. In pockets there might have been stories of heroism and uprising, sure. In fact, there were. But Carson’s claim was “greatly diminished,” not just “diminished,” and it can therefore be judged on those grounds. But here’s the thing: Whether Carson is right or wrong in his central claim is entirely irrelevant to the more important question here, which is not “can armed people always overthrow a tyrannical government” but “does the government get to deny them the chance to try?” The right to keep and bear arms is an individual right, not a collective privilege, and individual rights do not need to be justified on practical grounds. Just as we would not deny free speech to a man simply because he seemed unlikely to win a given argument, we must not abandon our auxiliary self-defense rights on the basis that the odds might be stacked against the little guy. I’m a staunch defender of the right to keep and bear arms because I have an untouchable Lockean right to protect myself, not because I can prove definitively that I will never be outgunned. Would I necessarily win in a fight against a home intruder? No, I would not. Would I necessarily survive if the government or the police wanted me dead? No, I would not. But I will assert my unalienable right to try against any man at any time in any place, and those who hope to strip me of that chance can man up, head to my front door, and come and damn well take it.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/05/hillary-clinton-unveils-plan-for-tougher-checks-in-bid-to-reduce-gun-violence,"The Democratic presidential candidate says she would also roll back legal immunity for the gun industry as she attempts to seize the policy initiative First published on Mon 5 Oct 2015 05.00 BST Hillary Clinton has unveiled a series of proposals aimed at reducing US gun violence, including universal background checks, rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry, and legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. Clinton’s announcement follows yet another deadly mass shooting – the 44th this year at a school – at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Thursday.  The Democratic presidential candidate vowed to take on the National Rifle Association and gun lobby in the wake of the massacre, in which a gunman killed nine people and then himself. At a town hall in New Hampshire on Monday morning, Clinton said that she would work with Congress but she would also “look for ways as president to tighten some of these checks, particularly to get more of the background checks get done at gun shows and online than we currently have”. Clinton’s firearm proposals arrived as gun control moved to the forefront of the conversation in the Democratic race for the White House. Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley issued his own broad platform for reform on Sunday, while Vermont senator Bernie Sanders sought to position himself as a consistent supporter of gun safety measures despite having a mixed record on the issue. Under Clinton’s plan, background checks would be expanded to close loopholes for private sales at gun shows and online. Congress failed to act on legislation with similar aims after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Clinton, if elected president, would use executive action to deem any individual selling a significant number of firearms “in the business”, in order to hold private sellers to the same rules as gun retailers. She also proposed closing a so-called “Charleston loophole” – a reference to the shooting in June at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which the gunman was able to purchase a gun despite having a criminal record because if a background check takes longer than 72 hours a gun dealer can sell the weapon without the completed check. Clinton’s campaign said she would push to ensure that a gun sale does not go forward if a background check is not complete within three days. “Hillary Clinton lived in Arkansas and represented upstate New York – she knows that gun ownership is part of the fabric of many law-abiding communities,” her campaign said in a release. “But as a nation we can no longer allow guns to fall into the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the seriously mentally ill. It is a rebuke to the families that have lost loved ones, to the communities that are plagued by gun violence, and to this nation that we love.” According to a campaign fact sheet, Clinton would also call on Congress to repeal a federal statute signed by former president George W Bush that granted broad legal protections to gun manufacturers and dealers in both state and federal court. Citing the disproportionate number of deaths among young black males, Clinton’s campaign said she would also crack down on dealers who knowingly supply so-called straw purchasers – illegal sales in which someone buys a gun to deliver it to a third party – and traffickers with illegal weapons. Clinton, a longtime and staunch advocate for stricter gun laws, also embraced proposals to prevent domestic abusers and the mentally ill from acquiring firearms and backed classifying straw purchasing as a federal crime. The former secretary of state has repeatedly called for action against gun violence while campaigning across early voting states amid a series of high-profile shootings over the summer. Whether referring to the Emanuel AME Church massacre in June, the movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana in July, or the gunning down of two reporters during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Virginia last month, Clinton has refused to shy away from calling for gun safety measures and has condemned the influential gun lobby. Her rhetoric has grown sharper each time, and her frustration increasingly more visible. A day after the Oregon shooting last week, Clinton urged the American public to form a “national movement” against the NRA and similar gun rights activists. “What is wrong with us, that we cannot stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby, and the gun manufacturers they represent?” Clinton said while campaigning in Davie, Florida. “This is not just tragic. We don’t just need to pray for people. We need to act and we need to build a movement. It’s infuriating.” She added: “Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families.” Clinton’s proposals would face steep opposition from Republicans in Congress and would ostensibly require Democrats to regain control of both chambers. Republicans on Capitol Hill have insisted gun violence is a mental health issue and they led a filibuster in the Senate against the universal background checks bill in 2013. “We need universal background checks,” Clinton said at the New Hampshire town hall. “We know that they will work.” Republican presidential candidates are uniformly against any new restrictions on guns. Former governor Jeb Bush and senator Marco Rubio, both of Florida, told reporters at separate campaign events on Friday that new laws were not the answer. Real estate mogul and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump blamed the issue on mental illness, while referring to mass shooters in a Sunday interview as “geniuses in a certain way”. Clinton has chosen a bolder way forward on gun control, a hot-button issue that is rarely made a theme by presidential campaigns – apart from by Republican candidates on the other side of the argument touting their second amendment bona fides. O’Malley, who as Maryland governor signed into law one of the most comprehensive gun safety packages in the country, on Sunday called on both Clinton and Sanders to back provisions he had laid out. These included a requirement that every person who purchases a firearm obtain a license and is fingerprinted, making gun trafficking a federal crime, and a ban on assault weapons. Clinton has long supported an assault weapons ban, something signed into law by her husband Bill Clinton in 1994 but not reauthorized by Congress upon its expiration in 2004. While running for president in 2008, the former first lady said during a primary debate that she would seek to reinstate the ban if elected to the White House. Clinton also stood by her support of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines last summer while promoting her book Hard Choices. “We cannot let a minority of people, and that’s what it is, it is a minority of people, hold a viewpoint that terrorises the majority of people,” Clinton said at the time during a CNN town hall. Clinton’s press secretary, in a Twitter response to a Guardian reporter after this article was published, said her new plan included support for an assault weapons ban. Sanders has a more complex record on anti-gun violence measures. Although he voted to expand background checks after the Newtown shooting, the independent senator – who is running in the Democratic primary – voted against legislation establishing mandatory background checks known as the Brady Bill signed by Bill Clinton in 1993. Sanders also supported the law granting legal immunity to gun manufacturers. Reacting to the Oregon shooting in a Friday interview on MSNBC, the senator said he would support a ban on assault weapons and closing loopholes in the background checks system. Gun rights groups have already begun to sound alarms over a Hillary Clinton presidency and its implications for access to firearms. But the Democratic frontrunner reminded voters on Friday that she had been here before, referring to the former Clinton White House. “We took them on in the ’90s. We’re gonna take them on again,” she said. In a statement, Dan Gross, the President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a leading pro-gun control group, praised Clinton’s plan. “This is the type of bold leadership that we have been missing in Washington,” said Gross. “Just four years ago it seemed unthinkable that a major presidential candidate would make gun violence prevention a cornerstone of his or her platform. We applaud Hillary Clinton for standing up to the gun lobby and for her vision to protect the people and nation she hopes to represent as president.” Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Washington"
http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/01/oregon-shootings-updates-i-will-not-give-him-credit-sheriff-says/,"This article is more than 1 year old Updated at 2:23 a.m. EDT There are more reports, albeit second hand, indicating that the shooter at Umpqua Community College asked students about their religion before opening fire. According to the Los Angeles Times, Ana Boylan, a student who was shot in the back, told her grandmother from her hospital bed that as she lay wounded, the gunman asked people to rise and state their religion. “If they said they were Christians, they were shot again,” the grandmother, Janet Willis, told the Times. “And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,'” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account. “And then he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line doing this.” Kortney Moore, 18, a student in the writing class where the shootings occurred, told the News-Review Today in Roseburg, Ore., that the shooter told people to get on the ground, and then asked people to stand up and state their religion and then began firing. David Jaques, publisher of the Roseburg Beacon News, told Fox News “We have a text from allegedly one of the students who was in the room at the time. And it reads as follows: ‘The shooter was lining people up and asking if they were Christian. If they said yes, then they were shot in the head. If they said no or didn’t answer, they were shot in the legs.'” Another account came from Autumn Vican, who described to NBC News what her brother J.J. witnessed in the room where the shootings occurred. According to NBC: “Vicari said at one point the shooter told people to stand up before asking whether they were Christian or not. Vicari’s brother told her that anyone who responded ‘yes’ was shot in the head. If they said ‘other’ or didn’t answer, they were shot elsewhere in the body, usually the leg.” [Nine victims and gunman dead in mass shooting at Ore. community college]  Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said at a news conference Thursday night that he would not personally utter the name of the shooter and urged the media to follow his example. “I will not name the shooter,” he said. “I will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice. Media will get the name confirmed in time … but you will never hear us use it.” “We would encourage the media and community to avoid using it,” he added, “repeating it, or engaging in any glorification and sensationationization of him. He in no way deserves it. Focus your attention on the victims and their familes and helping them to recover.” A U.S. law enforcement official identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer of Winchester, Ore.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/09/oregon-college-shooting-barack-obama-visit,"First published on Fri 9 Oct 2015 22.18 BST Over the protests of local residents asking him to “leave us in peace”, President Obama flew to Oregon to meet families of the victims of the mass shooting at Umpqua community college one week ago.  As the president carried out his visit, news emerged of two additional campus shootings on Friday, in Arizona and Texas. In brief public remarks following an hour-long meeting with the families at Roseburg high school, Obama said the US had to figure out a way to stop mass shootings from happening. “I’ve obviously got very strong feelings about this,” Obama said. “We’re going to have to come together as a country, but today is about the families.” The president was greeted upon his arrival in Roseburg by protesters holding signs reading “gun free zones = kill zones”, “Obama is wrong” and “Please leave us in peace”. Others held signs welcoming the president. The protesters said they opposed the timing of the president’s visit amid reports that he would seek to impose new – if limited – restrictions on gun sales in the wake of the Oregon shooting. The White House signaled on Thursday that Obama may take executive action to require private dealers who sell a significant number of firearms to conduct background checks on buyers. Currently only dealers officially certified as “engaged in business” of firearms sales need conduct such checks. No such measure would have provided a safeguard in the Oregon shooting, in which a gunman killed nine people on campus on 1 October and injured nine others before taking his own life. The gunman, Chris Harper Mercer, had no criminal record and had passed background checks to amass an arsenal of 13 weapons. After meeting with families in Roseburg, Obama was scheduled to fly to Seattle for a fundraiser. Hunting is popular in Oregon, a state with relatively liberal gun laws. Permits are required to carry a handgun (but not rifles or shotguns), and firearms may be carried in restaurants, according to the National Rifle Association. On Friday one protester, Jason Harju, bristled when speaking of the press conference Obama held shortly after the Umpqua community college shootings. The community had been reeling in shock, he said. The bodies had not been buried. But the president was already pushing his agenda. Obama did not speak address the protesters in Roseburg, but Harju took the day off from work, strapped his .40-caliber pistol to his belt buckle, hopped in a rig with the sticker “Oregunian” on the back window and joined hundreds of other protesters. “He’s not welcome to politicize our tragedy for his agenda,” Harju said. “We all know what that agenda is: gun control.” Like many of those who peacefully protested outside the tiny airport where the president’s helicopter touched down, Harju said stricter gun control laws would only hurt law-abiding citizens. “Spend more money on mental health,” Harju said. “That guy [the gunman] was obviously a nutcase.” Jan Cuddy, whose three daughters graduated from the community college, said she would like to believe Obama visited Roseburg because he was compassionate. “But I’m not sure if that’s the case,” said the 64-year-old. “The minute it happened, he was on the news, he made it political. The families don’t need it.” Cuddy held a sign that said: “I”m a Christian. Why didn’t God stop the shooting? How could he? He is not allowed in school anymore.” Heather Sherman, who overheard Cuddy, quietly disagreed. The 34-year-old said the shooting in her hometown prompted her to apply for a concealed weapons permit. “The president is here for the families,” she said. “I may not agree, about gun control, but he’s here to support Roseburg.” Counter-protesters, meanwhile, argued that the town should welcome the president, whatever the politics of his message. Last week I was proud of my community, now I'm incredibly embarrassed. Pure ignorance As the president was flying to Oregon, news broke of a shooting at Texas Southern University in Houston, with one dead. It appeared to be the third shooting – and first fatal shooting – on that campus since 27 August. Earlier on Friday, an 18-year-old student killed one person and wounded three others when he opened fire during a confrontation on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff."
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114854687/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Oregon-shooting-I-dont-even-want-to-know-the-names-yet-Im-not-ready/,"ROSEBURG, Ore. — The 26-year-old gunman in the deadly shooting spree in southern Oregon is believed to have left behind a document that glorified mass killings and bitterly referred to his lonely existence with few human contacts outside the Internet, a law enforcement official said Friday. The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, also said one of the four weapons used by the gunman in the Umpqua Community College shootings to kill nine people was registered to someone else. Federal law enforcement sources have identified the killer as Chris Mercer, who lived in the area. Local authorities say the male gunman — who they have refused to name publicly to avoid giving him further notoriety — was killed in a shootout with police shortly around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday. As details came to light, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin named the victims who died: Lucero Alcaraz, 19, of Roseburg, whose sister posted on Facebook that she won scholarships to cover her college costs;Quinn Glen Cooper, 18, of Roseburg, whose family said he loved dancing and voice acting;Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59, an outdoors lover who was taking classes at the same time as her daughter;Lucas Eibel, 18, of Roseburg, who was studying chemistry and loved volunteering with animals;Jason Johnson, 33, whose mother told NBC News that he successfully battled drug abuse and was in his first week of college;Lawrence Levine, 67, of Glide, an assistant professor of English at the college;Sarena Dawn Moore, 44, of Myrtle Creek;Treven Taylor Anspach, 20, of Sutherlin; andRebecka Ann Carnes, 18, of Myrtle Creek. USA TODAY James Alan Fox: Umpqua shooting - a tragedy, not a trend Authorities confiscated 13 weapons associated with the shooter, six at the site of the killings and seven at his apartment, Celinez Nunez, assistant agent in charge at Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told reporters Friday. Nunez said all the weapons had been purchased legally by the shooter or members of is family. The ATF agent also said a flak jacket outfitted with a steel plate and containing 5 magazines of ammunition was found next to a rifle belonging to the gunman at the scene of the shootings. The rambling document left behind, and believed to be written by the gunman, lamented an isolated life with little promise, the official said. USA TODAY In Roseburg, God will remain when the news crews bail: John S. Dickerson The contents and tone of the document, the official said, tracked the often desperate and depressed writings from members of a loosely affiliated group known as the ""beta boys."" The official said members associated with the group share profound disappointment with their lots in life and the lack of meaningful relationships. Nine others were killed in the shooting spree that has rocked this rural community. It was the fourth shooting involving students on a U.S. college campus since August. Those who knew the shooter described a deeply troubled loner. At an apartment complex where Harper-Mercer and his mother lived in Southern California, neighbors remembered a quiet and odd young man who rode a red bike everywhere. Reina Webb, 19, said the man's mother was friendly and often chatted with neighbors, but Harper-Mercer kept to himself. She said she occasionally heard him having temper tantrums in his apartment. ""He was kind of like a child so that's why his tantrums would be like kind of weird. He's a grown man. He shouldn't be having a tantrum like a kid. That's why I thought there was something — something was up,"" she said. Bronte Harte, another neighbor, described Harper-Mercer as ""really unfriendly"" and said he would ""sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" A woman believed to be Harper-Mercer's mother lived upstairs and was ""crying her eyes out"" on Thursday, Harte said. Residents in this rural community had braced Friday for the release of the names of the dead. In addition to those killed, nine people were injured during the ordeal in a college classroom. After the shooting Thursday, students were evacuated on school buses to the Douglas County fairgrounds, where some spoke with police, visited with grief counselors and ministers and then reunited with family. The UCC campus was closed on Friday, but authorities allowed students and staff to meet at the fairgrounds to be driven back on campus on school buses to retrieve their belongings and cars. Many who were there expressed horror and shock over the tragedy. Shelby Rokus, 18, struggled to comprehend the bullets that pierced through one of the victims that she says she has known since childhood. The female victim is being treated at an area hospital. Rokus found out about her friend's injuries while she was at a vigil on Thursday night. ""That was really hard to hear,"" she said. Rokus is a student at UCC, but she wasn't on campus Thursday, she said. She added she felt bad thinking of her friend in the intensive care unit by herself. She said she hoped to visit her and bring her flowers soon. ""It's really heart-aching to know that a lot of innocent people had to die,"" Rokus said. ""No one deserved that."" Derek Sjogren, 18, said Friday at the fairgrounds he was at the pool at the physical education center of the UCC campus when he learned about the shooting unfolding at Snyder Hall. He said he heard a lot of people yelling, then shooting, and his class went into lockdown. Kallista Fletcher, 21, said she didn't know Rebecka Ann Carnes very well. But she knows she was a kind woman who loved God, she said Friday at the fairgrounds. Fletcher said she found out about Carnes' death through Facebook on Thursday night. ""It's hard to lose someone who can make an impact on someone with just a smile,"" she said. Fletcher, a sophomore at UCC, was at the fitness center when news of the shooting spread across the campus. On her fluorescent pink shirt were hastily drawn hearts and the writing ""#pray4UCC""in black ink. Although she was attempting to live out her routine Friday, she said, ""my life is not normal right now."" On Thursday, the shooting prompted a visibly frustrated President Obama to renew his calls for more gun regulation. Two of the 10 people initially admitted to Mercy Medical Center after the shooting will remain, one in critical condition and one in stable condition, Jason Gray, chief medical officer, told reporters Friday. They were among four who underwent operations from gunshot wounds. One of the four has been released and another was expected to leave the hospital Friday. Gray also said that two of the original 10 were treated and released and one person died in the hospital. The remaining three were transferred to another PeaceHealth Sacred Heart medical Center in Springfield. Officials said Friday that its three patients were stable, although two remained in the intensive care unit. One of the victims had suffered a head injury and one with a gunshot wound to the spine. Responding to a report that the suspect asked the religion of a victim, Hanlin said he had also heard the claim, but it was ""way too early to determine"" whether the shooting was a hate crime. Dustin Cosby, an associate professor at Umpqua Community College, said that with such a small town, ""everyone's connected."" CONTRIBUTING: Saerom Yoo, (Salem, Ore.)

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-wish-i-didnt-recognize-_b_8289952.html,"Writer/Professor, Husband, Dog-Lover, Dodger Fan In 2013, Santa Monica College, where I teach, was the site of a mass shooting that left three members of our college community dead. The shooter, who was also killed, left behind a duffel bag full of ammunition and a handgun aside from the AR-15 rifle used to carry out the attack. Memorials on campus have become an everyday piece of the campus landscape since. On Thursday, October 1st, a self-identified ""spiritual conservative"" who posted on ""Beta-Male"" message boards about killing people did, in fact, kill people. He warned like-minded individuals that he was going to do it on a college campus in the Pacific Northwest, and many of them encouraged him, thanking him for the heads up. He killed 9 people and injured 7 others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, OR. He had three pistols and a rifle. Also on Thursday, October 1st, arsonists attempted (I assume this was their goal) to burn down a Planned Parenthood branch in Thousand Oaks, CA near my city of Los Angeles. Luckily, they were not very good at arson, and the consequences were minor. The intent, however, was not. They poured gasoline inside the building and set it on fire. On August 20th, two men in Boston beat a homeless Hispanic man with a pipe and urinated on him while proclaiming their admiration for Donald Trump. They told this man, who was homeless and helpless, that all illegals should be deported. Trump meekly condemned the attack, but then quickly conceded that his supporters ""are passionate."" A couple weeks ago, George Zimmerman retweeted a photo of Trayvon Martin's corpse. Zimmerman's Twitter profile picture is a confederate flag. His profile is merely a Latin phrase that translates to ""if you want peace, prepare for war."" He has been cited and arrested for acts and threats of violence targeting his intimate partners. This is a man who has become a paragon for gun ownership and action in the name of self-defense. As I was editing this piece to be posted, we experienced two more school shootings: one in Texas, one in Arizona. I don't have much more to say, I don't want to laugh, but I no longer know what to do. When there isn't even time to edit a short essay before two more shootings pop up, we're beyond the pale. Rhetoric has consequences. Invoking the Second Amendment stirs passion in a certain voting populace -- they have long been conditioned that being pro-guns is patriotic, that freedom means the right to bear arms. There is truth to that. But who is responsible for the addendum that any attempt to make sure one is not a lunatic with violent objectives is infringing on that freedom? Who benefits from that? Statistics clearly show that the general population does not. Invoking the primal ""us vs. them"" reflex creates a common enemy and gives an easy excuse for why someone is down on their luck -- ""if it wasn't for those pesky outsiders, I'd be doing better."" Inconveniently for Trump, another loud man with political aspirations used the same approach in 1933 with a fair amount of success. This reactionary status quo is toxic and pervasive, and we should not be mistaken about what that stance is really about -- people citing patriotism, religious principles, traditional values have no interest in any of the above. This is a cultural war. This is a power struggle between those who do not want to lose the power they have (and have had for a long time) and those who only want to be powerful enough to carve out a place for themselves. History has taught us that those in power don't like to have questions asked of them; they're much more comfortable providing qualifiers -- ""one bad apple...you can't fix crazy..."" -- than accepting responsibility. One does not need to be on the bullhorn calling for violence to incite it. Paranoia consistently lends more than a helping hand to ignoring the plague of true violence, sexism and racism. Women who make claims and accusations of rape are often first met with skepticism and concern about ulterior motives. Knee-jerk reactions to calls for increased awareness about on-campus cultures of sexual violence cite concern for a society obsessed with political correctness and in-vogue activism. The Black Lives Matter movement has been countered with All Lives Matter, as though the two sentiments are mutually exclusive. There is a culture of aversion in facing real issues of personal safety while embracing the sanctity of our ""individual freedom"". What is more critical to the quest for individual freedom than individual safety? We can point the finger at those who have a stage for this rhetoric, those who somehow legitimize it as the rhetoric of principles. And we should. But we must also demand better from ourselves, for ourselves. Demand that those who see feminism as an attack on men give reasons for feeling that way. Demand that those who refuse to acknowledge that we have a gun problem give reasons for why waiting periods and background checks are so fascistic. Demand that those who insist that the culture of sexual violence is not a problem give reasons for why the statistics aren't good enough for them. Because I'm sick of looking at yet another story of death and violence in my newsfeed and recognizing it as typically American, as just another day in the greatest country on Earth. Rhetoric has consequences. It goes beyond clapping hands in a room or likes on social media. For the people who believe they are merely applauding a voice in a dialogue that has sought to exclude them (often mistakenly), there are others out there who believe they have been charged with a righteous vigilante mission. It is time that we hold those who plead ignorance to this phenomenon accountable. It is time for us to demand better from everyone around us. It is time to actually help those who need help. It is time to elevate the conversation. Enough is enough. Writer/Professor, Husband, Dog-Lover, Dodger Fan Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

Golden State Gov. Jerry Brown has officially signed the bill banning concealed guns in schools. If only Texas could have followed suit. Instead, they passed legislation to expand concealed weapons on campuses. This is exactly why Wilmore has awarded the state with the ""Cray-Cray"" label. Wilmore says the new law affects all Texas universities, including UT Austin where on August 1, 1966, The Texas Tower Sniper went on a killing spree taking 14 lives and wounding 32 others. The law goes into effect on the 50th anniversary of the shooting. Classy, Texas. ""You're seriously instituting a law allowing guns on campus on the 50th anniversary of America's first mass shooting on campus?! Are you kidding me?!"" Wilmore said with anger. ""That's like taking silver from Ground Zero and making commemorative coins out of it."" Thankfully, some students are protesting this law, and Wilmore is standing in solidarity with them. ""While it will soon be legal to carry a gun on campus, openly carrying a dildo is still considered an obscenity under University of Texas Austin's rules,"" Wilmore reported. ""So, to be clear, your fake penis isn't OK, but your over-compensation penis is.""  Watch more here: The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore

But studies have found several ways to reduce the current annual toll of 30,000 gun deaths — from universal background checks to smart policing. By
      
        Peter Aldhous Last updated on October 2, 2017, at 1:11 p.m. ET Posted on October 2, 2015, at 11:35 a.m. ET In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, on the Las Vegas Strip, everyone is asking once again: What can be done to reduce the toll of gun violence? Two years ago, after a mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, BuzzFeed News asked researchers who have devoted their careers to studying gun violence. Their answers were encouraging: Saving thousands of lives every year is an achievable goal. But meeting that challenge will require both conservatives and liberals to look beyond their usual knee-jerk reactions. It's not a simple question of gun rights versus gun control. This, with some small updates, is what the experts had to say. Here is a sobering fact: The number of Americans who died from gunshot wounds in the last decade — more than 300,000 — exceeds the nation's total combat fatalities in World War II. Gun deaths in the U.S. today are almost as frequent as deaths from traffic accidents, as this graph shows. Yet the United States isn't an especially violent country, judged by statistics on general assaults. It's the rate of gun deaths, specifically, that outstrips that of any other developed nation. When you look across rich countries, those with higher rates of gun ownership tend to have higher gun homicide rates. Put simply, people with guns seem to kill people at higher rates than people armed with less efficient killing machines. The big problem is that no policy that stands any chance of being implemented in the United States is likely to make a big dent in the huge numbers of guns that are already in circulation — as many as 310 million, or nearly one for every U.S. resident. The Second Amendment is a reality, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to bear arms operates at the level of the individual, not just the ""well regulated militia."" So whatever gun control advocates would like to do, the government is not going to come and take away people's guns en masse. What's more, some of the gun controls that are often proposed probably wouldn't achieve very much. After the Newtown School shooting in December 2012, President Barack Obama called for a reinstatement of a federal ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault weapons that lasted for a decade, ending in 2004. Congress did not oblige. And while that decision had more to do with the influence of the gun lobby than the scientific evidence, studies of the earlier ban's effects by Christopher Koper of the University of Pennsylvania found no strong indication that it reduced gun deaths. If anything, he concluded in a report to the Department of Justice, ""gun attacks appear to have been more lethal and injurious since the ban."" Police and rescue workers respond to the Las Vegas shooting. Enthusiasm for bans on the sale of especially lethal weapons stems from the context in which the debate over gun violence comes to the fore — in the wake of mass shootings, where shooters arm themselves to inflict maximum casualties. Even though mass shootings come around with distressing regularity — and seem to be getting more frequent — they barely register in the overall statistics on gun deaths in America. In 2012, the deadliest year for mass shootings in three decades, according to data compiled by Mother Jones, 72 people died in incidents including the Newtown massacre and the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Casualty reports from Las Vegas mean that 2017's toll may be even higher. Every one of those deaths is a personal tragedy, but in the context of some 30,000 annual fatalities from gunshots across the nation, they are drops in a vast ocean of suffering. The best evidence on how to prevent mass shootings comes from Australia. In 1996, after 35 people were killed in a massacre in Tasmania, Australia banned a range of weapons including semi-automatic and pump-action rifles and shotguns. Income tax was hiked so the government would have the money to buy back the now-illegal weapons, and the results were striking: There had been 13 mass shootings in 18 years before the new controls, but no similar incident in the decade that followed. The Second Amendment makes it unlikely that the Australian experiment could ever be repeated in the United States. ""It is so far beyond anything that is going to happen,"" Philip Cook, a gun violence researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News. Among the gun violence experts consulted by BuzzFeed News, the most popular policy was the introduction of universal background checks, intended to keep guns out of the hands of people disqualified through their criminal records or mental health issues. (A comprehensive review of gun violence studies, published in January 2017, confirmed that background checks and laws that require a permit to purchase firearms seem to be the most effective policies.) Under federal law, these checks are required each time a registered dealer sells a gun. But they're not required for private sales, which may account for 40% of the trade. It's a loophole that you can drive busloads of firearms through. Eight states, including California and New York, have implemented universal background checks, including for private sales. But it's been hard to judge the success of these moves, because changes to gun laws tend to be introduced in packages, making it difficult to know which policy, if any, was responsible for any subsequent changes in gun violence. However, legislative changes in Connecticut and Missouri, which went in opposite directions, have provided a clearer picture. Until 2007, Missouri required people buying a gun to have a permit issued by law enforcement, which was contingent on passing background checks. Over the five years that followed without this requirement, the state's annual gun murder rate rose by 16%, according to a study from a team led by Daniel Webster of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Neighboring states saw no similar spike. Connecticut introduced a similar permit-to-purchase law, again with background checks, in 1995. In this case, Webster's team estimated that the law reduced gun homicides by 40%. Some of the strongest evidence on reducing gun violence comes not from controls on gun purchases, but from an approach to policing called ""focused deterrence."" Pioneered in the 1990s in Boston, where it was called ""Operation Ceasefire,"" this involves police and community leaders meeting with members of criminal groups and delivering the message that their identities are known and that gun crime won't be tolerated. Then come efforts to help people out of criminal activity, with the clear understanding that law enforcement will crack down hard on the targeted individuals if they use their guns. Since rolled out in dozens of other cities, repeated studies have shown that the approach can reduce urban gun violence — typically by between 20 and 40%. In the wake of almost every mass shooting — especially if it occurs in a location where people aren't supposed to carry guns — gun lobbyists tell us that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And over the years, the main reason given for gun ownership in surveys of the U.S. public has shifted from hunting to personal protection. But the evidence suggests that gun ownership actually does little to make people safer. Analyzing 14,000 incidents involving personal contact between perpetrator and victim from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health and economist Sara Solnick of the University of Vermont found that a gun was brandished in self-defense on only 127 occasions. And doing so didn't reduce the likelihood that the victim would be injured — although it did lessen the chance of property loss. The idea that gun ownership deters crime also looks shaky when subjected to close scrutiny. Again using data from the NCVS, Cook found in an earlier study that burglary rates tend to be higher in counties with higher rates of gun ownership. The reason for the relationship wasn't clear, but one possibility is that guns themselves are valuable commodities, motivating criminals to steal them. The conversation about how to reduce gun deaths tends to focus on homicides. But for every gun murder, there are almost two gun suicides. And while gun homicides have been in decline since the early 1990s, firearm suicides are on the rise. The demographics of these two categories of gun deaths are very different. Young black men are disproportionately likely to be both victims and perpetrators of gun murder. Those who turn firearms on themselves are again mostly male, but are typically older and white. ""Firearm violence is increasingly becoming an old white guy problem,"" Garen Wintemute, an emergency room doctor at the University of California, Davis, told BuzzFeed News. So any attempt to seriously reduce gun deaths needs to keep firearms out of the hands of people who are most vulnerable to self-harm. If they can't get their hands on a gun, chances are that someone desperate enough to consider killing themselves will survive: The fatality rate for suicide attempts overall is around 9%; but where a firearm is used, that rises to 85%. Encouragingly, background checks seem to help prevent gun suicides, as well as reducing gun murders. Webster and his colleagues have calculated that Connecticut's permit-to-purchase law reduced firearm suicides by 15.4%, while Missouri's repeal of its law increased its gun suicide rate by 16.1%. It's easy to blame gun violence on mental illness, especially in the wake of a mass shooting by a highly disturbed individual. But this is based on a misunderstanding of the wider problem. Epidemiological studies have found that people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are somewhat more likely to be violent than healthy people. But the vast majority of mentally ill people are never violent to others — and even if the risk posed by mentally disturbed people could be reduced to the average level for the general population, about 96% of the violent crime in America would still occur. Far more powerful is the link between mental illness and gun suicide. ""If we were to cure mental illness, the suicide rate would go down by 50 to 75%,"" Jeffrey Swanson, a gun violence researcher at Duke University, told BuzzFeed News. The federal Gun Control Act, passed in 1968, prohibits gun ownership by people who have been involuntarily committed for treatment for psychiatric illness, and those judged to be ""mentally defective."" The problem is that these restrictions are both too broad and too narrow. In particular, many people at high risk of harming themselves have never been committed involuntarily for treatment. Another problem is that the federal mental health restrictions on gun ownership are lifelong. This fails to recognize that suicidality comes in episodes — which usually pass, if the urge is not acted on. What we should do, according to Swanson, is to recognize when people's behaviour indicates that they are at immediate risk of harming themselves or others, and temporarily restrict their access to guns until they have recovered. Some states have introduced laws that try to do this. In California, people who are deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others can be held in a mental health facility for 72 hours, and since 1990 this has triggered a five-year ban on possessing guns — which can be curtailed earlier though a court petition. We're still waiting for conclusive studies on the effectiveness of such restrictions, Swanson said. ""It will be a while before there's enough experience with these laws to say whether they've worked."" buzzfeed.com Updated to include information on the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas and a January 2017 review of scientific studies.

08 October 2015  The sheriff of Douglas County in Oregon where a mass shooting occurred on Oct. 2 is in hot water after the discovery that he posted a ""Sandy Hook truther"" video to Facebook in 2013. Now, a new study casts doubt on the psychology blamed for belief in such conspiracy theories. Contrary to popular opinion, the research finds, people who think conspiratorially aren't more likely to assume everything happens for a reason, rejecting the likelihood of random chance, than people who don't hold conspiracy beliefs. ""What we show is that the psychology of conspiracy theories is located in a rather high level of cognition, perhaps at the level of beliefs and ideology and not at the level of a deeper personality or perception mode,"" said study researcher Sebastian Dieguez, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories] The spread of conspiracies In the Sandy Hook shooting, 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Almost immediately after the news broke, conspiracy theorists, some calling themselves Sandy Hook truthers, began claiming that the shooting never really happened, and that the supposed bereaved parents were hired actors. Similar conspiracy theories have sprouted up over other high-profile shootings, including the August on-air killing of a television reporter and cameraman in Virginia and the October shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. A common theory for why people believe in these sorts of conspiracies is that they can't accept that, sometimes, bad things happen for no good reason. In other words, they're primed to see patterns everywhere — and, in fact, find it comforting to think that someone's in charge when tragedy strikes. A few indirect studies bolstered this notion, including a 2008 study showing that people who felt they had less control were more likely to believe in conspiracies than people who felt more in control of their lives. But no one had ever tested the link between a rejection of randomness and conspiracy belief directly, Dieguez told Live Science. ""It was not clear whether 'nothing happens by accident' is something conspiracy believers say or whether it's how they think,"" he said. ""That's what we wanted to test, whether this is a rather deep psychological disposition they have."" Accepting randomness The researchers conducted three very similar studies in which they asked participants to look at randomly generated strings of X's and O's and gauge how ""truly random"" each was. In two of the experiments, participants were told that they were on the hunt for a cheater who was supposed to write down the results of a coin flip, but just wrote results without actually flipping the coin. In one experiment, the X's and O's were presented without any suggestion of human intentionality behind them. The first two experiments involved 107 and 123 psychology students, respectively, and the third involved 217 French speakers recruited online. Each participant filled out a survey about their conspiracy beliefs, which they were told was part of a separate study. Then the researchers looked for a link between people's perceptions of randomness and their conspiratorial mindset. They found nothing. ""This finding, although it's a negative finding, was actually pretty interesting, because in our study we had very strong findings [otherwise],"" Dieguez said. ""Pretty much everything worked except the main hypothesis that we wanted to test."" Complex conspiracies The researchers found that people are actually quite good at detecting random-seeming character strings (as determined by a mathematical algorithm). They also found something that other scientists have noted, which is that people who believe in one conspiracy theory tend to believe in many conspiracy theories, even those that have nothing to do with each other (or even contradict one another). Someone who believes the moon landing was faked, for example, is likely to believe that Princess Diana was deliberately murdered. But the researchers couldn't find evidence that a deep-seated need to see patterns is linked to conspiracy beliefs. [10 Persistent Kennedy Assassination Theories] Other modes of thought have been linked to the conspiratorial mindset. Anxiety is one. ""Anomia,"" feelings of powerlessness and distrust, is another. People who believe in conspiracies also seem prey to the conjunction fallacy, which is a cognitive ""oops"" that involves believing that a more specific thing is more likely than a general one. This bias was illustrated in a 1974 paper with the ""Linda problem,"" which describes a 31-year-old single woman interested in social justice and anti-nuclear protests. It then asks whether it's more likely that a) Linda is a bank teller, or b) Linda is a bank teller and an active feminist. Mathematically, it has got to be more likely that A is truer than B. There is always a greater likelihood that one thing will happen than that two independent things will happen. If, for example, there's a 1 in 10 chance that Linda is a bank teller, A has a 10 percent chance of being true. If there's also a 5 in 10 chance that Linda is a feminist, the likelihood that she is a bank teller as well is 5/10 times 1/10, or 5/100 — only a 5 percent chance. But because B seems more descriptive of a person like Linda, people often fall prey to thinking B is more likely than A. Ultimately, the new research — published Sept. 21 in the journal Psychological Science — suggests that conspiracy thoughts are complex and subject to outside factors, Dieguez said. ""It shows that, well, perhaps conspiracy theories are really associated with ideology, with our worldview, and not really to more basic cognitive factors,"" he said.

https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/425095/hillary-calls-new-laws-wouldnt-have-stopped-oregon-shooter-jim-geraghty,"Follow Us National Review A Telling Anecdote from Clarence Thomas 30 Years of Justice Clarence Thomas BREAKING: Supreme Court Sets November 1 Oral Argument on Texas Abortion Case Americans Should Be More Upset about Infrastructure Inefficiency What You Missed Last Night “We need universal background checks, we know that they will work,” Hillary Clinton declared after a mass shooting by a perpetrator who passed a background check. The Oregon shooter bought his guns legally. So did the Roanoake, Virginia shooter. The Tucson shooter passed a background check. The Aurora, Colorado shooter bought all of his guns legally.
Hillary blamed the Charleston shooter’s ability to buy a gun on a “loophole in the Brady Bill.” It wasn’t a loophole in the law; it was that local and FBI officials simply didn’t do their job correctly:

On April 11, Roof tried to buy a handgun at a store in West Columbia, S.C. And under normal procedure, that paperwork was assigned to an examiner at the FBI’s unit in West Virginia. The unnamed FBI examiner turned up Roof’s arrest on March 1 on a felony drug charge — but the system did not show a conviction, and it wasn’t enough to deny the purchase.
So she kept checking. And, Comey said, the first mistake comes in here. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the Lexington County, S.C., sheriff’s office as the arresting authority. The examiner then reached out to the sheriff’s office and prosecutors in Lexington for more information.
The sheriff’s office told her the Roof case was not theirs and advised her to check with police in Columbia, S.C.
And now, Comey said, the second mistake was made. The examiner consulted a contact sheet for local contacts in Lexington County, and didn’t see anything for Columbia. So she called West Columbia, where Roof allegedly tried to buy the gun, instead. Local authorities in West Columbia said they had no record of the case, and the examiner turned to other matters while she waited to hear from prosecutors.
Under the normal process, if gun dealers do not hear back from the FBI with a flat denial in three business days, they are free to sell the weapon to the person who filled out the biographical paperwork. And that’s what the gun store did with Roof on April 16.

Hillary’s mention of the gun show loophole generated automatic applause. Again, none of the mass shooters above obtained their firearms at gun shows. Hillary repeated the oft-debunked “40 percent of guns  are sold without a background check” statistic, a figure that stems from a 1994 study of 251 people. Blame NBC’s Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist had a responsibility to ask Hillary how any of the laws she suggested would have stopped the Oregon shooting. They didn’t. Hillary never seems to get those kinds of questions in her infrequent appearances for questions from the media. Meanwhile, the man who had as much ability to shape the Oregon shooter as anyone else, his father, blames guns. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/02/obama_on_shootings_only_voters_can_stop_carnage.html,"President Obama, in what has become the grimmest routine of his presidency, beseeched Americans Thursday evening to transform yet another mass shooting into a rallying cry for “modest” new gun regulations. “This is something we should politicize,” Obama said during emotional, at times angry remarks in which he quoted himself, and then challenged his conservative critics and gun-law opponents head-on. Expressing sorrow and angst for grieving victims and their families for the 15th time during his presidency following a domestic shooting incident, this time in Oregon, the president voiced exasperation with Congress, irritation with the news media, and determination to campaign for new laws he said a president cannot accomplish alone, but which require the collective will and “courage” of voters, including gun owners. In Roseburg, Ore., officials said 10 people died and at least seven were injured Thursday when a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College. The suspect, identified as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, was declared dead after exchanging gunfire with authorities. The president, speaking in the White House briefing room, did not wait for the public identification of the suspect or the victims before repeating his conviction that additional gun restrictions he did not specify would spare American families from what he called “carnage” that has become so commonplace, it has rendered the public “numb.” “We don’t know why he did what he did,” Obama said, after noting he had visited the “good people” residing in Roseburg in the past. “It’s fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations might me,” he said, walking head-long into a debate about whether mental illness or guns are to blame for mass murders committed by young men. In arguing that federal and state regulation of guns would prevent future murders, Obama again compared the United States to developed countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where he said tighter gun restrictions reduced mass shooting statistics. And he challenged the news media to publish statistical comparisons between domestic deaths tied to terrorism and mass deaths committed by troubled killers with guns. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is not enough,” Obama said, at times wandering away from his prepared text, now achingly familiar to his speechwriters. He said his critics argue, correctly, that as president he seeks to politicize the issue. “But this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic,” he said. He said American voters bear some responsibility if they believe action focused on guns in Congress and within state legislatures could save lives. “This is a political choice that we make,” he argued, “to allow this to happen every couple of weeks.” “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and save lives, and to let young people grow up, and that will require a change of politics on this issue,” he said. “Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody,” Obama said, gun safety and control issues “should be a relevant factor in your decision.” At the start of his second term, Obama and Vice President Biden unsuccessfully pushed to enact tougher background checks and assault weapons restrictions through Congress. Despite increased mass shootings nationwide and struggles to understand their causes, the Senate blocked legislation. “We’ve become numb to this,” Obama said, raising his voice as he listed numerous sites of U.S. mass shootings during his two terms. “What’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation … `We need more guns,’ ‘fewer gun safety laws,’ they’ll argue. Does anybody really believe that?” Obama asked. “There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country; they know that’s not true.” While the president sought to rally Americans to ask lawmakers to act, Republican candidates seeking to succeed him expressed little appetite for gun legislation. Ben Carson, who is currently polling in the top tier of GOP aspirants, reacted to the Oregon murders during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Prior to Obama’s remarks, the retired neurosurgeon said, “Obviously there are those who are going to be calling for gun control. But that happens every time we have one of these incidents,” Carson said. The focus on guns is misplaced, he said. “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.” Jeb Bush, reacting to Oregon’s events via Twitter, said he was “praying” for victims and their families and called the murders a “senseless tragedy.” Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also a GOP presidential candidate, offered prayers. RealClearPolitics political reporter Rebecca Berg contributed to this report.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/09/the_more_you_politicize_guns_the_weaker_your_case_becomes_128356.html,"After the horrific mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, President Barack Obama made an impassioned case that gun violence is ""something we should politicize"": ""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" Everything in that statement is wrong. What happened in Oregon is tragic, and the nation should comfort families and look for reasonable and practical ways to stem violence, but there is only one murderer. Now, if government somehow bolstered, endorsed or ""allowed"" the actions of Chris Harper-Mercer -- as it might with, say, the death of 10,000-plus viable babies each year or the civilian deaths that occur during an American drone action -- a person could plausibly argue that we are collectively answerable as a nation. Then again, when the president asserts that Americans are collectively answerable, what he really suggests -- according to his own broader argument -- is that conservatives who've blocked his gun control legislation are wholly responsible. The problem with that contention, outside of the obvious fact that Republicans never condone the use of guns for illegal violence (in fact, these rampages hurt their cause more than anything), is that Democrats haven't offered a single bill or idea (short of confiscation) that would impede any of the mass shootings or overall gun violence. This is not a political choice, because it's likely there is no available political answer. For the liberal, every societal problem has a state-issued remedy waiting to be administered over the objections of a reactionary Republican. But just because you have a tremendous amount of emotion and frustration built up around a certain cause doesn't make your favored legislation any more practical, effective or realistic. It doesn't change the fact that owning a gun is a civil right, that the preponderance of owners are not criminals or that there are 300 million guns out there. And if it's a political argument you're offering -- and when hasn't it been? -- you'll need more than the vacuousness of ""this is bad, so we have to do something."" That's because anti-gun types are never able to answer a simple question: What law would you pass that could stop these shootings? Many liberals see the Second Amendment as tragically misinterpreted or useless and guns as abhorrent, so they do not believe that any legislative imposition is a trade-off -- even an ineffective law. Many conservatives view guns as a civil right, so this is an unacceptable trade-off. Some don't even view mass shooting as primarily a gun problem. Now, that doesn't mean guns have nothing to do with it, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it well responding to a Slate piece: ""One can simultaneously believe that the high volume of firearms contributes to our high homicide rate and that these laws aren't good ideas. It's actually pretty easy to believe both of these things at once, since none of the regulations at issue would do much at all to reduce our high volume of firearms."" Jeb Bush took a lot of heat for asserting that ""stuff happens"" (out of context). Now, horrific stuff happens, and we should do what we can, balanced with a host of other concerns, to stop these shootings. But it's worth pointing out that less stuff has been happening. Despite all the Obama administration's fearmongering and as horrifying as any shooting is, gun violence has precipitously declined over the decades without any meaningful federal law being enacted. This most likely tells us there are a number of other social currents driving this kind of violence. The left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills -- because no person can be evil. So the debate takes on the same old contours, and we focus on firearms and nothing else. That kind of political debate only makes it less likely that anything good will happen. When we politicize a tragedy, it is immediately sucked into a broader ideological conflict. Then conservatives (at least when out of power) will see (rightfully, I believe) an intrusive agenda that is a perpetual slippery slope. (Can you blame them when they hear this? ""No, we don't want confiscation, but look at what the Australians did! They confiscated guns. We don't want confiscation, but isn't that Second Amendment interpretation so stupid?!"") Trust me, it's not unreasonable to treat liberal policies as if they have a tendency for mission creep and unwieldy expansion.

In the wake of Thursday’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, many Republicans were quick to dismiss renewed calls for increased gun safety measures, in favor of discussing the need for a stronger mental health care system. On Sunday, John Oliver agreed that mental health is a topic Americans need to properly address. But as he explained on the latest Last Week Tonight, broaching mental health issues in the aftermath of a mass shooting is more often than not a political strategy used to simply reroute the conversation away from gun control. “It seems like there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health,” Oliver said, while featuring the talking points of Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee—all of whom steered away from discussing increased gun control legislation after the shooting in Oregon, to tout the need for better mental health programs. In reality, this is dangerously problematic because, as Oliver explains, “the vast majority of mentally ill people are nonviolent, and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally-ill people.” But if Republicans are only willing to talk about treating mentally ill people following mass shootings, so be it: Then at the “very least we owe them a fucking plan,” Oliver said.

All Rights Reserved. CONNECT Sign up for our NB Daily newsletter to receive the latest news. We've been waiting for the media attacks on Ben Carson to begin. To this point he'd been (relatively) untouched: he wasn't viewed as a credible threat. But his numbers aren't receding. They're growing. So he's now in the crosshairs. The ""news"" networks have spent several days manufacturing outrage over Carson, saying that if he were in a mass-shooting situation, he would want to fight back. “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me.” It didn’t matter how many millions of sensible Americans – especially males – would have that same thought. Experts insist distracting the shooter by taking action like throwing things can help save lives. Indeed, shortly after 9-11 we were visiting with an airline security expert who stated, emphatically, that in a similar situation the impulse must be to attack the attacker, no matter how hopeless it might appear. Instead, the networks seized on how Carson was insulting shooting victims as being too passive -- an aggressively biased take. On NBC’s Today, news anchor Natalie Morales had the vapors: “It's beyond insensitive. It's hard to hear that.” Co-host Willie Geist huffed, “But my goodness, who would ever second-guess people in that situation?” Meanwhile, the seventysomething politicians running on the Democrat side can apparently say all kinds of hyper-negative things and expect the “objective” media to ignore them. After all, isn’t it just scientifically verifiable that conservatives are evil? For example, at a surprise appearance at a Latino PAC’s fundraiser on October 7, Vice President Joe Biden uncorked on Donald Trump and the other GOP hopefuls. Latinos were hanging their heads, he said. “People walked in like literally down because of the beating, the beating Hispanics are taking at the hands of the Republican caucus — I mean the Republican presidential race.”  The American people, Biden said, are “so, so, so much different than these guys who are appealing to everything from homophobia to this notion of the like, Know-Nothing Party of the late 1800s.” Network TV coverage? Nothing. (The Know-Nothing Party only flourished in the 1840s and 1850s, but who expected Biden to get an A in History -- or even pass?) On the very same day, Hillary Clinton smeared the National Rifle Association at an Iowa town hall. “You know, the NRA’s position reminds me of negotiating with the Iranians or the communists,” she said. “The NRA tries to keep gun owners—the ones who are members—really upset all the time so they can keep collecting their money, because they tell them they’re the only thing that’s going to stop the black helicopters from landing in the front yard and people’s guns being seized.” James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal quipped: “If the NRA is like ‘the Iranians or the communists,’ does she recommend the same negotiating strategy the administration has employed with them — i.e., make concession after concession, then declare a diplomatic triumph?” Again, the network coverage: zero. On October 10, President Obama spoke to donors in Hollywood about the Republicans in the House and in the presidential race that the “politics of fear...can express itself in anti-immigration rhetoric. It can express itself in hunkering back on the need to take care of folks who are vulnerable...It can express itself in sort of cheap jingoism and militarism and nationalism that’s not grounded in our national security interests. But it’s a dangerous path.” This is apparently dime-a-dozen liberal arrogance from Obama. So it’s not news. Our media distort the picture so only the Republicans are ideological and refuse to compromise, which completely avoids Obama’s second-term “executive action” trench warfare. As usual, one of the media’s most obvious demonstrations of favoritism is defining what is a damaging, disgraceful gaffe. Liberals – even Joe Biden! – just can’t seem to be guilty of one.

http://www.nationalmemo.com/behind-ben-carsons-rebellious-public-image-a-dc-insider-is-hard-at-work/,"By Emily Flitter NEW YORK (Reuters) – U.S. presidential candidate Ben Carson may be the farthest Republican voters can get from the party’s establishment: A retired neurosurgeon with a penchant for inflammatory comments who has never held, much less run, for elected office. While many of his rivals are concentrating on hiring staff and renting offices in key states like New Hampshire and Iowa, Carson is pursuing a more unorthodox campaign, sometimes less visible to the naked eye, that has fueled his rise to the top of the polls. He is just behind Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination. Helping Carson position himself as the answer to Americans’ frustration with Washington gridlock is Barry Bennett, 52, a Washington insider, who is running a decidedly non-traditional campaign to build his client’s brand. Under Bennett’s guidance, the campaign enables supporters to connect with Carson with unusual intimacy: they can get emailed or texted questions personally answered; or huddle on his Facebook page every day; and donors can even have their children’s names posted on the campaign’s bus. Carson’s campaign relies heavily on the Internet to get his message across, more so than the campaigns of his 13 rivals. The campaign’s Facebook page has more than 4 million followers, while Carson’s Instagram account has 127,000. One popular Facebook feature shows fans holding handwritten explanations of their support for Carson. Bennett says urging supporters to take more of those photos was his idea to drive voter engagement. Starting this month, the campaign began using a computer program that lets one staffer answer up to 9,000 questions per day. Supporters will be able to text or email Carson a question and get an individual response. The program uses an algorithm that groups together questions that may look unique but are actually similar enough to elicit a single answer. Bennett says using the program was also his idea. In an interview at Carson’s campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, Bennett saw no contradiction in a long-time Washington political operative helping a candidate whose main selling point is that he has never worked in Washington. “We both believe Washington needs to be turned upside down,” he said. He also said he has no problems with some of Carson’s more controversial statements. Carson has faced sharp criticism for comments suggesting the Holocaust could have been diminished if Jews had been armed, and that victims of a recent mass shooting in Oregon should have fought harder against the gunman. “He doesn’t speak in a way that Washington politicians are trained to speak, so to some people that sounds crazy but to me and most of America that sounds refreshing,” Bennett said. Indeed polls show that Carson has not been hurt at all by the comments. In fact, he may even have grown stronger. AN INSIDER’S STORY Bennett, who has worked for 30 years as a political operative for hire, has also helped to mastermind a data-collection operation that has enabled Carson to tap into an army of small donors and out-raise his rivals. As of Friday, Carson had raised more than $37 million, from 725,000 donors, with the average donation size at $51, according to a tally provided by Bennett. His nearest Republican fund-raising rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, had each raised about $25 million by the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Bennett’s career began when, as a student, he started doing data entry for President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 campaign. After working in the Ohio state legislature, Bennett moved to Washington, where he worked for the Republican National Committee and Ohio Senator Rob Portman and founded a media analysis firm. In short, he became a Washington insider. “Who with a 202 (Washington) area code on their cell phone would even think of working for Carson?” said New Hampshire Republican strategist Dave Carney. Carney said most veteran operatives would have balked at what many see as Carson’s moonshot bid for the presidency. He gave Bennett credit for seeing something in Carson when others didn’t. “He saw an opportunity where most folks would turn their nose up at it.” Carson has used the opportunity to play with some out-of-the box ideas, like appealing to supporters for donations in exchange for having their children’s names displayed on a campaign bus. The bus is now covered with hundreds of little stick figures whose shapes are filled in with names written in tiny script. “He’s got outsized talents with a moderate-sized ego,” said Republican strategist Matt Schlapp, who knows Bennett. “Usually it’s the other way around.” ROMNEY FILM Until now, Bennett was probably best known for having produced “When Mitt Romney Came to Town” during the 2012 Republican primaries, when he was working as an independent consultant. It was a 28-minute collection of interviews with people who lost their jobs after Romney’s private equity firm Bain Capital took over their companies. The film dampened voters’ enthusiasm for Romney and forced his campaign to go into damage control mode, said a former Romney staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I wished he was on our side,” he said of Bennett. In 2015, Bennett has been on the other side of political attacks, defending Carson’s controversial statements. On Carson’s comments encouraging people to fight back against gunmen, Bennett invoked the victims of the al Qaeda-hijacked airplane Flight 93, which crashed into a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Investigators believe the passengers thwarted a planned attack when they stormed the cockpit and attempted, unsuccessfully, to regain control of the aircraft. “That’s what you hope you’d do in that situation,” Bennett said.

Mark FollmanNovember/December 2015 issue Soon after the school year started in September 2000, a police officer working at McNary High in Keizer, Oregon, got a tip about a junior named Erik Ayala. The 16-year-old had told another student that “he was mad at ‘preps’ and was going to bring a gun in.” Ayala struck the officer as quiet, depressed. He confided that “he was not happy with school or with himself” but insisted he had no intention of hurting others. Two months later, Ayala tried to kill himself by swallowing a fistful of Aleve tablets. He was admitted to a private mental health facility in Portland, where he was diagnosed with “numerous mental disorders,” according to the police officer’s report. To most people, Ayala’s suicide attempt would have looked like a private tragedy. But for a specialized team of psychologists, counselors, and cops, it set off alarm bells. They were part of a pioneering local program, launched after the Columbine school massacre the prior year, to identify and deter kids who might turn violent. Before Ayala was released from the hospital, the Salem-Keizer school district’s threat assessment team interviewed his friends, family, and teachers. They uncovered additional warning signs: In his school notebooks, Ayala had raged about feeling like an outsider and being rejected by a girl he liked. He had repeatedly told his friends that he despised “preps” and wished he could “just go out and kill a few of them.” He went online to try to buy a gun. And he’d drawn up a hit list. The names on it included his close friend Kyle, and the girl he longed for. The threat assessment team had to decide just how dangerous Ayala might be and whether they could help turn his life around. As soon as they determined he didn’t have any weapons, they launched a “wraparound intervention”—in his case, counseling, in-home tutoring, and help pursuing his interests in music and computers. “He was a very gifted, bright young man,” recalls John Van Dreal, a psychologist and threat assessment expert involved in the case. “A lot of what was done for him was to move him away from thinking about terrible acts.” As the year went on, the team kept close tabs on Ayala. The school cops would strike up casual conversations with him and his buddies Kyle and Mike so they could gauge his progress and stability. A teacher Ayala admired would also do “check and connects” with him and pass on information to the team. Over the next year and a half, the high schooler’s outlook improved and the warning signs dissipated. When Ayala graduated in 2002, the school-based team handed off his case to the local adult threat assessment team, which included members of the Salem Police Department and the county health agency. Ayala lived with his parents and got an IT job at a Fry’s Electronics. He grew frustrated that his computer skills were being underutilized and occasionally still vented to his buddies, but with continued counseling and a network of support, he seemed back on track. The two teams “successfully interrupted Ayala’s process of planning to harm people,” Van Dreal says. “We moved in front of him and nudged him onto a path of success and safety.” But then that path took him to another city 60 miles away, where he barely knew anyone. This past August, I traveled to Disneyland to join more than 700 law enforcement agents, psychologists, and private security experts from around the country at the annual conference of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals. While families splashed in the Disneyland Hotel’s pools and strolled to the nearby theme park, conference attendees sat in chilly ballrooms for sessions like “20 Years of Workplace Shootings” and “Evil Thoughts, Wicked Deeds.” After a day of talks focused on thwarting stalkers and preventing the next Sandy Hook, it seemed incongruous to emerge to throngs of overexcited kids and their weary parents enjoying the nightly fireworks. But it is no coincidence that Disney plays host to this conference. As gun rampages have increased, so have security efforts at public venues of all kinds, and threat assessment teams can now be found everywhere from school districts and college campuses to corporate headquarters and theme parks. Behind the scenes, the federal government has ramped up its threat assessment efforts: Behavioral Analysis Unit 2, a little-known FBI team based in Quantico, Virginia, now marshals more than a dozen specialists in security and psychology from across five federal agencies to assist local authorities who seek help in heading off would-be killers. Those calls have been flooding in: Since 2012, the FBI unit has taken on more than 400 cases. The conference keynote was given by Reid Meloy, a tall, white-haired forensic psychologist from the University of California-San Diego who is a leading researcher in the field. His presentation was peppered with gallows humor—a clip from Breaking Bad, a photo of Jack Nicholson “playing himself” in The Shining—and professional koans. “Monitor your own narcissism,” he warned the assembled investigators. “This is going to be easier for some of you to get than others,” he quipped, flashing an image of Donald Trump. There was a simple reason, Meloy suggested, for the record number of people packing the room: Mass murder is on the rise. “We’ve seen this very worrisome pattern over the past five or six years of an increase in targeted violence in public places,” he told me later. “Personally and professionally, this is a big concern—that uptick is very important, especially as violent crime has decreased.” Threat assessment is essentially a three-part process: identifying, evaluating, and then intervening. A case usually begins with a gut feeling that something is off. A teacher hears a student’s dark comments and alerts the principal, or someone gets freaked out by a coworker’s erratic behavior and tells a supervisor. If the tip makes its way to a local threat assessment team, the group quickly analyzes the subject’s background and circumstances. They may talk with family, friends, or coworkers to get insight into his intentions, ability to handle stress, and, most importantly, potential plans to strike. “One of the first things you focus on with this process is access to weapons,” Meloy notes. Like the group that handled Ayala’s case, the team draws on mental health and security expertise. Possible responses range from helping the subject blow off steam and refocus on school or work to providing longer-term counseling. If violence seems imminent, involuntary hospitalization or arrest may be the safest approach. But such drastic measures are rare. “With a lot of these cases, you peel back the curtain and there are good social and mental health interventions that are diverting the person onto a better course,” Meloy says. Often the best initial step is the most direct—conducting a “knock and talk” interview, which has the dual benefit of offering help and putting the subject on notice. Simply realizing that authorities are watching can be an effective deterrent. Threat assessment requires a remarkable shift in thinking for law enforcement because in most cases no crime has occurred. “Our goal is prevention over prosecution,” supervisory special agent Andre Simons, who led the FBI unit until this summer, explained when we met at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington earlier this year. “If we can facilitate caretaking for individuals who are not able to perceive alternatives to violence, then I think that’s a righteous mission for us.” Ever since Columbine, the FBI has been studying what drives people to commit mass shootings. Last fall it issued a report on 160 active-shooter cases, and what Simons could disclose from its continuing analysis was chilling: To a much greater degree than is generally understood, there’s strong evidence of a copycat effect rippling through many cases, both among mass shooters and those aspiring to kill. Perpetrators and plotters look to past attacks for not only inspiration but operational details, in hopes of causing even greater carnage. Emerging research—including our own analysis of the “Columbine effect“—could have major implications for both threat assessment and how the media should cover mass shootings. In October 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Simons’ FBI unit had helped prevent almost 150 attacks in one year. The nearly two dozen experts I spoke with didn’t like to be so definitive, noting that it’s impossible to prove a negative. But many cited cases in which they believed threat assessment teams had prevented great harm. Sergeant Jeff Dunn, who leads the Los Angeles Police Department’s Threat Management Unit, described a firefighting recruit who became enraged when he failed out of the academy. “He told another recruit, ‘When they fire me, I’m gonna come back here and fucking massacre everyone.'” Academy officials alerted the LAPD, and Dunn’s unit got a search warrant for the recruit’s home. “This guy was absolutely geared to go to war,” Dunn said. His arsenal included nearly a dozen semi-automatic handguns and assault rifles and a homemade explosive device. “Had there not been an intervention of some sort,” Dunn said—in this case, an arrest on a felony weapons charge—”I have no doubt that it would’ve resulted in an active-shooter scenario.” But cases often aren’t so clear. One of the biggest challenges for threat assessment teams is that sometimes the quieter, less outwardly threatening subjects can prove the most dangerous. “When there are individuals who prompt a sense of anxiety or fear but no law or policy has been broken,” Simons says, “that’s the real work.” Of the hundreds of subjects tracked by the FBI unit, he told me, only one went on to injure somebody. But measuring the effectiveness of threat assessment is tricky because ultimately there is no way of knowing whether someone would have otherwise gone on to attack. Meloy compares the challenge to fighting cardiovascular disease: Doctors can’t predict whether someone will have a heart attack, but they can do a lot to decrease the risk. “You try to lower the probability.” When the next shooting happens at a school, an office building, or a movie theater, the question will again be asked: “What made him snap?” But mass murder is not an impulsive crime. Forensic investigations show that virtually every one of these attacks is a predatory crime, methodically planned and executed. Therein lies the promise of threat assessment: The weeks, months, or even years when a would-be killer is escalating toward violence are a window of opportunity in which he can be detected and thwarted. A growing body of research has shed light on this “pathway to violence.” It often begins with an unshakable sense of grievance, which stirs thoughts about harming people and leads to the planning and preparation for an attack. Elliot Rodger, convinced that women were unfairly denying him sex, seethed for months and fantasized about a “day of retribution” before he bought firearms, scouted sorority houses, and went on to kill 6 people and injure 14 others near Santa Barbara, California, in May 2014. A confluence of behaviors can indicate that someone is poised to walk into a school or a shopping mall and open fire. These include an obsession with weapons, a fixation on images of violence, and a history of aggressive acts that aren’t directly related to the planned attack—possibly a way for the perpetrator to test his resolve. Almost a year before Rodger struck, he attempted to push some women off a 10-foot ledge at a house party. Some killers have mutilated pets before going on rampages. In fact, the vast majority of mass shooters signal their intentions in advance, though usually not directly to their intended targets. This “leakage,” as threat assessment experts call it, can be difficult to recognize. Before Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, he told a friend about his desire to kill people and start a race war. (The friend claimed he didn’t think Roof was serious.) Weeks before Rodger attacked, he posted disturbing videos that prompted his mother to alert a county mental health agency that he was suicidal. In response, sheriff’s deputies went to Rodger’s apartment to do a welfare check, interviewing him just a few strides from where he’d stashed three handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He persuaded them he was fine. “Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped,” he later wrote, “and the police never came back.” We know that many mass shooters are young white men with acute mental health issues. The problem is, such broad traits do little to help threat assessment teams identify who will actually attack. Legions of young men love violent movies or first-person shooter games, get angry about school, jobs, or relationships, and suffer from mental health afflictions. The number who seek to commit mass murder is tiny. Decades of research have shown that the link between mental disorders and violent behavior is small and not useful for predicting violent acts. (People with severe mental disorders are in fact far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.) That’s why sizing up a suspect’s current circumstances is crucial: Did he recently get fired from a job? Did he lose his kids in a nasty custody battle? Is he failing out of school or abusing drugs? Investigators also look for visible signs such as deteriorating hygiene or living conditions, which is why approaching someone directly and building rapport can be so important. “Most people who have a psychotic episode aren’t thinking violently,” explains Mario Scalora, a forensic psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. But for those who are experiencing psychosis—including 80 percent of stalkers who target public figures—intervention can head off disaster. Scalora describes the case of a student he calls Bob who experienced a psychotic break in his early 20s. Scalora’s campus threat assessment team grew concerned after getting a tip about Bob muttering to himself and making ominous comments. They sent plainclothes detectives to his residence, where on the wall of his room hung a grotesque theater mask whose mouth had been sewn shut with black string. Bob said that voices were commanding him to hurt people at the behest of God, and that he was scared. The detectives persuaded him to check into a psychiatric ward for evaluation. “This made him feel cared for,” Scalora says, “and gave us a mechanism by which we could continue to manage him. By building rapport with him, we’re learning a lot about him and getting rich assessment data, and in the meantime he’s not stalking people on our campus. It’s a win-win.” When the lead detective followed up with Bob a couple of days into his hospital stay, he asked her, “Can you go to my room and get the mask, and this big knife that’s under my bed? I don’t want them anymore.” The concept of cops and mental health experts working hand in hand to stop violent crimes before they occur is relatively new. Its origins trace in part to a summer morning in West Los Angeles. Shortly after 10 a.m. on July 18, 1989, a 21-year-old actress named Rebecca Schaeffer was getting dressed for a meeting with Francis Ford Coppola about a role in the next Godfather movie when her apartment buzzer sounded. The intercom was broken, so Schaeffer went to the front door, where a young man stood holding a shopping bag. Nineteen-year-old Robert Bardo had been trying to reach Schaeffer for two years, writing her fan letters and periodically taking a bus from Tucson to LA to look for her. He’d never been able to get onto the soundstage where Schaeffer filmed the sitcom My Sister Sam, but he’d finally found her address. Bardo had already dropped by that morning, according to his own account, and Schaeffer had chatted with him politely. But now she was anxious. “You came to my door again,” she said. “Hurry up, I don’t have much time.” Bardo later recalled, “I thought that was a very callous thing to say to a fan.” In his bag he had a letter and a CD he wanted to give her. He also had a .357 Magnum handgun. A neighbor heard Schaeffer scream as Bardo fired a single shot into her chest.  Until then, obsessive behavior that could turn violent was still widely viewed as a mental health issue beyond the purview of law enforcement, even after the attacks on John Lennon and Ronald Reagan and a spate of government workers “going postal.” But Schaeffer’s murder shocked Holly­wood, and studio heads called for action by the LAPD, which was already frustrated by its inability to stop a string of stalking murders of nonfamous women. The LAPD devised a plan for a multidisciplinary team that would aim to head off such crimes. The LAPD Threat Management Unit’s mission expanded in 1995 after a city electrician, angry about a poor performance evaluation, walked into the Piper Tech center downtown and shot four supervisors to death. “Piper Tech” became shorthand for the rising wave of workplace threats the unit began to confront. (It currently handles about 200 cases a year, roughly half of which are workplace related.) Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, the Secret Service had also been developing tenets of threat assessment, led by a former agent from Reagan’s security detail. But for most cops, close collaboration with mental health experts remained unheard of. And the idea of intervening before there was a crime to investigate went against everything they knew from their training. “It requires a paradigm shift,” says the LAPD’s Dunn. “So many in law enforcement don’t recognize how useful a tool this can be.” Then came Columbine. As they plotted for months to slaughter their classmates, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold weren’t just driven by rage and depression—they wanted to be immortalized and to inspire future school shootings. In diary entries and videos, the duo fantasized about Hollywood directors fighting over their story. They filmed themselves firing guns and yelling into the camera about killing hundreds and starting a “revolution.” Such “legacy tokens” now often include manifestos posted online by perpetrators. “They do this to claim credit and to articulate the grievance behind the attack,” says the FBI’s Simons. “And we believe they do it to heighten the media attention that will be given to them, the infamy and notoriety they believe they’ll derive from the event.” There has long been evidence that stalkers and mass murderers emulate their famous predecessors. Before Bardo gunned down Schaeffer, he sent a letter to Mark Chapman, imprisoned for the 1980 murder of John Lennon. When Bardo fled from Schaeffer’s building, among the items he discarded was a copy of The Catcher in the Rye, the novel Chapman infamously sat down to read after shooting Lennon. John Hinckley Jr. had a copy of the book and a John Lennon photo calendar in his hotel room when he tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Forensic psychologists describe this phenomenon as following a “cultural script,” or the “Werther effect,” referring to a spate of copycat suicides in 18th-century Europe after the publication of Goethe’s novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. The Columbine killers authored a grimly compelling new script at the dawn of the internet age. Sixteen years later, the Columbine legacy keeps reappearing in violent plots, driven in part by online subcultures that obsess over the duo’s words and images. “It’s a cult following unlike anything I’ve ever seen before,” says one longtime security specialist. To gauge just how deep the problem goes, Mother Jones examined scores of news reports and public documents and interviewed multiple law enforcement officials. We analyzed 74 plots and attacks across 30 states whose suspects and perpetrators claimed to have been inspired by the Columbine massacre. Law enforcement stopped 53 of these plots before anyone was harmed. Twenty-one plots evolved into attacks, with a total of 89 victims killed, 126 injured, and 9 perpetrators committing suicide. The data reveals some disturbing patterns. In at least 14 cases, the suspects aimed to attack on the anniversary of Columbine. (Twelve of these plots were thwarted; two attacks ultimately took place on different dates.) Individuals in 13 cases indicated their goal was to outdo the Columbine body count. And in at least 10 cases the suspects referred to Harris and Klebold as heroes, idols, martyrs, or God. At least three suspects made pilgrimages to Columbine High School—fulfilling the kind of “pseudocommando” mission that researchers have found mass shooters to be obsessed with. Two of them carried out rampages when they returned home—one at a college in Washington state and the other at a high school in North Carolina, using guns he’d decorated with pictures of the Columbine shooters. In another case, a 16-year-old from Utah flew to Denver without his parents’ knowledge, hired a driver to take him to Columbine, and met with the principal under the auspices that he was writing an article for his school newspaper. He was trying to elicit information on lasting trauma, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case. “All he wanted to know about was what the students and staff felt like—how long it took them to recover and if they still thought about it,” the official says. The teen was arrested back home for plotting with a fellow student to bomb his own high school. These publicly documented cases are just the beginning. “There are many more who have come to our community and have been thwarted,” says John McDonald, the director of security for Colorado’s Jefferson County school district, where Columbine High School is located. “They want to see where it happened, want to feel it, want to walk the halls. They try to take souvenirs.” Some aspiring copycats have even come from overseas, says McDonald. “The problem is always on our radar.” Gene Deisinger, a threat assessment pioneer who led Virginia Tech’s police force from 2009 to 2014, explains that the copycat effect also plays out at sites like Virginia Tech and Fort Hood. “Lots of the places that have experienced high-profile acts of mass violence over the last decade or more face ongoing threats from outsiders who identify with the perpetrators, the acts, or the places,” he says. Major attacks motivate copycats in other ways. In April 2009, Jiverly Wong blocked the back exit of the building in upstate New York where he’d taken English classes and then used guns similar to those of the Virginia Tech shooter to kill 14 people and wound four others before shooting himself. “There was evidence that he had studied the attack at Virginia Tech,” a federal law enforcement official told me, “looking at the chaining of the doors there that had prevented both entry and exit.” It’s not just Americans who emulate the killers of Columbine or Virginia Tech. Shooters inspired by these events have struck in Brazil, Canada, and Europe—particularly in Germany, where nine school shootings occurred in the decade after Columbine. At least three German shooters drew inspiration from Harris and Klebold, including an 18-year-old who referred to them as God and attacked his former school wearing a long black coat and wielding two sawed-off rifles, a handgun, and more than 10 homemade bombs. When I asked threat assessment experts what might explain the recent rise in gun rampages, I heard the same two words over and over: social media. Although there is no definitive research yet, widespread anecdotal evidence suggests that the speed at which social media bombards us with memes and images exacerbates the copycat effect. As Meloy and his colleagues noted earlier this year in the journal Behavioral Sciences and the Law, “Cultural scripts are now spread globally…within seconds.” In late August, this phenomenon reached its logical next step when a disgruntled former TV reporter gunned down two former colleagues during a live broadcast in Virginia while filming the scene on a camera. As he fled, he posted the footage on Twitter and Facebook. The first “social media murder” went viral in less than 30 minutes, raising the grim prospect that others will aim for similar feats—knowing that the news media will put them in the spotlight and help publicize their grisly images. (The 26-year-old who would go on a rampage at Umpqua Community College in Oregon five weeks later reportedly commented online about the Virginia shooting, “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”) But just as digital media has created platforms for dangerous people seeking a blaze of notoriety, it has also become a valuable tool for identifying them. “We’re now seeing that shooters are announcing more frequently via social media just prior to attacking,” Simons says, noting that potential killers can otherwise be conspicuously withdrawn. “When people express violent ideation, what we’re looking for is: Who are they talking to? Who’s listening?” These days, he adds, “it’s possible they’re living more vividly online than in the physical world.” Erik Ayala could barely sleep. He hadn’t worked for months. He hardly ever talked to his two high school buddies anymore, even Mike, with whom he now shared an apartment in Portland. In the three years since he’d moved there in 2006, he’d struggled to hold down a job or find a girlfriend. Now 24 years old, he was no longer in touch with the teams who had watched over him in his hometown for nearly five years. He had become increasingly withdrawn and often holed up in his bedroom playing Resistance: Fall of Man and other first-person shooter games. On the morning of January 24, 2009, Ayala scribbled a note apologizing to his family and bequeathing his PlayStation 3, his car, and what little remained in his bank account to Mike. “I’m sorry to put all this on you buddy,” he wrote. “I know it’s not much consolation but as my friend and roommate you are entitled to everything that I own. Good luck in this fucked-up world.” Then he grabbed the 9 mm semi-automatic he’d bought two weeks earlier at a pawnshop and headed downtown. Just before 10:30 p.m., a group of teens waited in line outside the Zone, an all-ages dance club. Ayala didn’t know anyone at the club, but to him it was a hangout for the kinds of kids he despised. In a matter of seconds Ayala fatally shot two teenage girls and wounded seven people, most of them also teenagers. As a security guard moved toward him, Ayala put the barrel under his chin and pulled the trigger one last time. It was the worst mass shooting in Portland’s history. Experts also cite it as a prime example of both the promise of threat assessment and its limitations. “Ayala ended up acting out his ideas from high school on a similar, if not the same, target population almost a decade later,” Van Dreal says. That may suggest the two Oregon teams prevented Ayala from going on a rampage when he was younger, but it also reflects the daunting challenge of managing a potentially dangerous person over the long haul. Even if a troubled kid can be turned away from violence, how do you ensure he becomes a well-adjusted adult? What happens when he moves beyond the reach of those who have helped him? When is a case really over?  Others have fallen through the cracks, including James Holmes, who underwent threat assessment and psychiatric care at the University of Colorado-Denver before he dropped out, cut ties with the school, and carried out the movie theater massacre in Aurora. Jared Loughner, who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011, had been booted out of Pima Community College after its threat assessment team looked at his disruptive behavior. Many mental health professionals still lack the training to evaluate potentially deadly people, says Deisinger, who is a psychologist as well as a cop. And they may be resistant to threat assessment’s tactics and urgency. “There’s nothing more frustrating than hearing people say there’s no way to stop these mass shootings from occurring,” says Russell Palarea, a forensic psychologist and veteran of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service who now consults for private corporations. Like many in his field, Palarea believes the key is helping more people understand what threat assessment is and how it works—similar to the “see something, say something” campaign meant to help foil terrorist attacks. “The methodology is in place,” he says. “We just need to train the public, law enforcement, prosecutors, hospital clinicians, and other professionals on their roles in helping to manage the threats.” The science behind threat assessment is still young, but it is attracting growing interest; last year the American Psychological Association launched the Journal of Threat Assessment and Management. The ranks of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals are rising, and since Sandy Hook, more corporate leaders have taken an interest in the strategy. Three states—Virginia, Illinois, and Connecticut—now mandate threat assessment teams in their public colleges and universities. Virginia was the first to do so (after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007) and now also requires them in all K-12 public schools. (Read more about its model here.) But should a huge investment in threat assessment really be our only serious effort to stop mass shootings? Australia, another frontier culture with a deep attachment to guns, endured a slew of mass shootings starting in the 1970s. After a disturbed young man killed 35 people and wounded 18 others in 1996, the country invested heavily in gun buybacks and enacted stricter gun laws. Suicides and murders with guns declined dramatically, and Australia has had only one public mass shooting in the two decades since.  Possession of a firearm, of course, is not a meaningful predictor of targeted violence. But at the conference in Disneyland, virtually everyone I spoke with agreed that guns make these crimes a lot easier to commit—and a lot more lethal. “There are so many firearms out there, you just assume everybody has one,” Scalora says. “It’s safer to assume that than the opposite.” The presence of more than 300 million guns in the United States—and the lack of political will to regulate their sale or use more effectively—is a stark reality with which threat assessment experts must contend, and why many believe their approach may be the best hope for combating what has become a painfully normal American problem. In a sense, threat assessment is an improvisational solution of last resort: If we can’t muster the courage or consensus to change our underlying policies on firearms or mental health care, at least we can assemble teams of skilled people in our communities and try to stop this awful menace, case by case. Kyle Alexander remembers how he and Erik Ayala met as freshmen in the high school marching band: They were both introverts who loved video games and commiserated about being misfits. Hours before Ayala carried out his attack in Portland, his roommate, Mike, called Alexander, who was living in Seattle. “He’d found the note and he sounded very frantic,” Alexander recalls. “He wanted to see if I knew Erik’s whereabouts.” Alexander was worried but didn’t know what he could do from so far away. Mike was also at a loss. “At the time we thought Erik was just going through another bad cycle of depression,” Alexander says. “We never saw it coming.” Only recently did Alexander learn the full details of Ayala’s case, including that he had once been on Ayala’s hit list. “It was surprising, and scary to think about,” he says. “Erik would go through very dark moods, but given the special relationship we had I was often able to help him turn things around.” Alexander wishes he’d stayed closer with Ayala after high school. “The social relationship piece of it is big,” he says. “I think it could’ve made a difference in his life.” Alexander is now 32 years old and lives in Salem, Oregon, where he works as a school psychologist. He is trained in threat assessment and works with school-based teams in his district. His passion is helping at-risk kids.

http://truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/yes-jeb-stuff-happens-because-the-bush-family-embraces-the-violence-of-empire-racism-and-guns/19566-yes-jeb-stuff-happens-because-the-bush-family-embraces-the-violence-of-empire-racism-and-guns," MARK KARLIN, EDITOR OF BUZZFLASH AT TRUTHOUT Jeb and the Bush clan bear some responsibility when ""stuff happens."" (Photo: DonkeyHotey) Last week, Jeb Bush went on record as publicly dismissing the need for reining in the lethal legacy of a fanatical gun culture and rampant gun ownership in the United States. He was speaking in response to the Oregon mass shooting at a community college, in which nine students were executed. As an article in The Washington Post reported, ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think that more government is necessarily the answer to this,"" he said. ""I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's just, it's very sad to see. But I resist the notion -- and I did, I had this, this challenge as governor, because we have, look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Bush was speaking at a forum hosted by The Conservative Leadership Project, a group with ties to South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who moderated the event. His comments came the day after a shooter at an Oregon community college killed nine before being killed by police. Several others are recovering from injuries. When a reporter asked Bush whether the remark was a mistake, he replied: ""No, it wasn’t a mistake, I said exactly what I said, explain to me what I said wrong."" It would be easy to dismiss Jeb's callous belittling of a mass shooting as a reassurance to the NRA, which is a key financial and voting-block supporter of presidential candidates. After all, when Jeb was governor of Florida, he gave the NRA pretty much whatever it asked for in terms of signing pro-gun legislation. In fact, it was Jeb Bush who signed the infamous and racist Stand Your Ground law in Florida. As an NBC News article recalls, ""With major support from the National Rifle Association under a Republican state legislature during Gov. Jeb Bush's administration, Florida became the first state to enact a Stand Your Ground law on Oct. 1, 2005."" It was, of course, the Stand Your Ground law that was the basis of George Zimmerman being acquitted of stalking and shooting Trayvon Martin to death, for nothing more than walking while Black. After killing Martin, Zimmerman also escaped charges in a number of domestic violence incidents, signed autographs at gun shows and engaged in ongoing racist tweets. Most recently, he accused President Obama of having a lot in common with Christopher Harper Mercer, the Oregon shooter. Just a short time ago, Zimmerman proudly retweeted a photo of Trayvon Martin's body. Jeb Bush is not directly responsible for the killing of Trayvon Martin, or the violent actions and racist words of George Zimmerman. Still, Jeb signed the Stand Your Ground law knowing the racist motivations of the NRA. More significantly, Jeb and the politicians in his family have long perpetuated the institutional racism embodied in US culture - and particularly advocated by the Republican Party - including unqualified support for current policing policies. Jeb Bush recently exposed his core attitude toward the Black electorate when he boasted that Republicans would be a better choice for African-American voters, because Democrats just offer ""free stuff."" Columnist Charles Blow of the New York Times wrote of Jeb's remark, There it is! If you let people talk long enough, the true self will always be revealed. Not only is there a supreme irony in this racial condescension that casts black people, whose free labor helped establish the prosperity of this country and who were systematically excluded from the full benefits of that prosperity for generations, as leeches only desirous of “free stuff,” this line of reasoning also infantilizes black thought and consciousness and presents an I-know-best-what-ails-you paternalism about black progress. This brief commentary can only offer a peek behind the veil of the Bush family's affirmation of both guns and institutional racism. However, Jeb has explicitly endorsed his brother's and father's use of militarized violence during their administrations, to further the goal of expanding and protecting US empire. He even claimed that the Iraq War was a good decision. In fact, Jeb boasts about the military actions of his brother and father when prodded by reporters. The Bush policy of killing in the name of empire extends from US-sponsored wars and massacres in Central America during the Reagan-Bush administration to the countless deaths and displacements of people in the Middle East resulting from the invasion of Iraq. Of course, it shouldn't be forgotten that George Herbert Walker Bush was head of the CIA when Operation Condor – in which the military dictatorships of South America's Southern Cone nations were responsible for the torture, deaths and disappearance of tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists and leftists - was at its height, with covert US support. No, you cannot hold Jeb accountable for the involvement of his father and brother in militarized violence that has resulted, directly and indirectly, in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. However, you can judge him based on his support of the US's role as a militarized superpower, which regularly disregards the deaths of people around the world - not just deaths in domestic shootings such as the one in Oregon. Because, as Jeb noted, ""Stuff happens."" Not to be reposted without permission of Truthout.  Is democracy dissolving before our very eyes? Donate to order this gift now!

http://www.nationalmemo.com/bush-familys-war-on-english/,"And the Bush family’s War on English continues. You are, by now, familiar with the astonishingly tone-deaf response by Jeb Bush, the nation’s would-be 45th president, to last week’s shooting at a community college in Oregon in which a gunman killed nine people. “Look,” said Bush, “stuff happens.” Like a stink bomb in the flower bed, the dismissive-sounding words were buried in a longer comment about whether this latest massacre should spur new legislation. Said Bush: “…I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this … I had this challenge as governor, because we had … look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” When a reporter asked about the wording afterward — perhaps trying to spare Bush some grief — the former Florida governor turned attitudinal. “No, it wasn’t a mistake,” he said. “I said exactly what I said. Explain to me what I said wrong.” “You said, ‘stuff happens,'” said the reporter. Whereupon, Bush hunkered deeper into his snit. “‘Things’ happen all the time,” he said. “‘Things.’ Is that better?” Um … no. And the pasting that followed was entirely predictable. Bush was slammed by Hillary Clinton and President Obama. In Mother Jones, the liberal magazine, his words were called “callous.” In Salon, they were dubbed “tactless, graceless and ham-handed.” But let’s not miss what’s truly offensive here. At one level, after all, this is just a new round of the gaffe gotcha game where you strip clumsy language of inconvenient context so as to imply the candidate said or meant something he never said or meant. So let’s be fair: Bush was not being callous toward the Oregon tragedy any more than Barack Obama was denying small businesspersons their due when he said, “You didn’t build that.” Rather, Bush simply offered an inarticulate statement of GOP orthodoxy: There are no legislative responses to mass gun violence. And while that’s a point some of us would dispute, it is not what makes his words appalling. No, what makes them appalling is the surrender they imply. “Stuff happens”? That’s what you say about the hurricane or the earthquake, the hail storm or the flood, natural disasters beyond the power of humankind to prevent. It’s what you say about cancer or Alzheimer’s or dog droppings on the lawn, the major and minor challenges that are an inescapable part of being alive. To say “stuff happens” about a mass shooting is to suggest that mass shootings are somehow inevitable and unavoidable. But that is simply not true. This “stuff” doesn’t happen everywhere — not with the numbing frequency it does here. It doesn’t happen like this in Great Britain. It doesn’t happen like this in Brazil. It doesn’t happen like this in Israel. It doesn’t happen like this in Japan, where gun ownership is strictly restricted, nor in Canada, where gun ownership laws are more liberal and there are, by one count, about 10 million firearms in private hands. Ten million. Yet, you know how many gun homicides there were in Canada in 2013? A hundred and thirty-one. Even as we mourn this latest mass murder, another is taking shape. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week. That’s how predictable this “stuff” has become. So it would behoove us to try and figure out what other countries know that we do not, what it is about our laws and/or our national character that returns us inevitably to this nexus of tragedy and recrimination week after week. You see, Bush is only half right. It is not that “stuff happens.” No, stuff happens here. (Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald, 1 Herald Plaza, Miami, Fla., 33132.

All Rights Reserved. CONNECT Sign up for our NB Daily newsletter to receive the latest news. Here we go again. Another day, another media frenzy. This time the media is in a tizzy about Ben Carson’s simple answer to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer’s equally clear question. Wolf asked Carson about a subject Carson has discussed before in reference to gun control. The Washington Post headlined it this way: Carson suggests that gun rights might have changed history for Jews in WWII The Post story begins: “Ben Carson said Thursday that Adolf Hitler’s mass murder of Jews “would have been greatly diminished” if German citizens had not been disarmed by the Nazi regime. The comment, which came during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, was similar to arguments Carson made following last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in which he defended the Second Amendment and suggested that the victims should have fought the gunman.” Well. Media firestorm to follow - immediately. From the Huffington Post to ABC  to Time and more (and more!) the liberal media was out there to dismiss Carson’s comments to Wolf Blitzer’s quite legit question as somehow as wacko as it was inflammatory. Even the Anti-Defamation League jumped in to say that Carson’s remarks were ""historically inaccurate and offensive.” Stop. One has to wonder, do all these media outlets have anybody working for them who is familiar with history? In fact, to the question of whether gun-toting Jews could have impeded Hitler the answer was long, long ago answered. And the answer is a decided yes. Look no further to than to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  to get the facts. What Ben Carson is suggesting is known to history as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which took place in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, Poland in 1943. Let’s quote the Holocaust Museum exactly on the subject: Between July 22 and September 12, 1942, the German authorities deported or murdered around 300,000 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto. SS and police units deported 265,000 Jews to the Treblinka killing center and 11,580 to forced-labor camps. The Germans and their auxiliaries murdered more than 10,000 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during the deportation operations. The German authorities granted only 35,000 Jews permission to remain in the ghetto, while more than 20,000 Jews remained in the ghetto in hiding. For the at least 55,000-60,000 Jews remaining in the Warsaw ghetto, deportation seemed inevitable. In response to the deportations, on July 28, 1942, several Jewish underground organizations created an armed self-defense unit known as the Jewish Combat Organization (Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa; ZOB). Rough estimates put the size of the ZOB at its formation at around 200 members. The Revisionist Party (right-wing Zionists known as the Betar) formed another resistance organization, the Jewish Military Union (Zydowski Zwiazek Wojskowy; ZZW). Although initially there was tension between the ZOB and the ZZW, both groups decided to work together to oppose German attempts to destroy the ghetto. ….While efforts to establish contact with the Polish military underground movement (Armia Krajowa, or Home Army) did not succeed during the summer of 1942, the ZOB established contact with the Home Army in October, and obtained a small number of weapons, mostly pistols and explosives, from Home Army contacts. In accordance with Reichsführer-SS (SS chief) Heinrich Himmler's October 1942 order to liquidate the Warsaw ghetto and deport its able-bodied residents to forced labor camps in Lublin District of the Generalgouvernement, German SS and police units tried to resume mass deportations of Jews from Warsaw on January 18, 1943. A group of Jewish fighters, armed with pistols, infiltrated a column of Jews being forced to the Umschlagplatz (transfer point) and, at a prearranged signal, broke ranks and fought their German escorts. Most of these Jewish fighters died in the battle, but the attack sufficiently disoriented the Germans to allow the Jews arranged in columns at the Umschlagplatz a chance to disperse. After seizing 5,000-6,500 ghetto residents to be deported, the Germans suspended further deportations on January 21. Encouraged by the apparent success of the resistance, which they believed may have halted deportations, members of the ghetto population began to construct subterranean bunkers and shelters in preparation for an uprising should the Germans attempt a final deportation of all remaining Jews in the reduced ghetto. …..The Germans had planned to liquidate the Warsaw ghetto in three days, but the ghetto fighters held out for more than a month. Even after the end of the uprising on May 16, 1943, individual Jews hiding out in the ruins of the ghetto continued to attack the patrols of the Germans and their auxiliaries. The Warsaw ghetto uprising was the largest, symbolically most important Jewish uprising, and the first urban uprising, in German-occupied Europe. The resistance in Warsaw inspired other uprisings in ghettos (e.g., Bialystok and Minsk) and killing centers (Treblinka and Sobibor).  In other words? In other words what Dr. Carson is suggesting -- specifically that a massively armed  Jewish population could have severely hampered Hitler’s Holocaust -- is supported by the true story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. In which a relatively small minority of Jews inside the ghetto, with a minimum amount of, according to the Holocaust Museum, “mostly pistols and explosives”  managed to “sufficiently disorient” the Nazis and “suspend further deportations” to the death camps, at least delaying the inevitable. Even more importantly, as word spread of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising it “inspired other uprisings in ghettos (e.g., Bialystok and Minsk) and killing centers (Treblinka and Sobibor).” One can only imagine the damage that could have been inflicted on Hitler’s thugs as they rose to power in the early 1930’s if the Jewish population had been as well armed as the American populace is today. Notably, the HuffPo story does reference the Warsaw Uprising, but dismisses it. An entirely wrong view if one pays attention to the authorities on the subject at the Holocaust Museum. What causes amazement here is how unremarkable Carson’s suggestion is. One doesn’t even have to go to the Holocaust to understand that an armed population poses a significant barrier to a dictatorial government. The American Revolution -- which began with an armed population in Lexington and Concord turning on the British Redcoats of a dictatorial British King -- is nothing if not an example of an armed population successfully standing up to a dictator. But this isn’t something the liberal media of the day wants to hear. They either don’t care - or worse don’t know - the history of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Responding to Carson’s obviously accurate understanding of history is never even on the table. And they think the real problem is Ben Carson?   I don’t think so.

http://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/425025/hillarys-server-smoking-gun-jonah-goldberg,"Follow Us National Review EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg’s weekly “news”letter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays. Dear Reader (including Kevin McCarthy, who may be too busy putting a cast on his Boehner, having stepped on it so badly), I feel like Donald Trump when asked to list all the reasons why he’s terrific; I have no idea where to begin. Lots of stuff has happened since my last “news”letter. Rather than approach this blank page with the sort of planning and care that you’ve come to expect from this well-crafted digital epistle, I’m going to throw care to the wind and, like Bill Clinton at a Saudi harem, I’m going to just jump right into it. Don’t Move On Speaking of Bill Clinton, by the end of his presidency, whenever critics said anything critical of him, the almost instantaneous response from his praetorians was to say (1) the critics  were “obsessed” or “haters” and (2) that it was time to “move on.” People forget that MoveOn.org began as a kind of non-partisan, No Labels-y, bit of marketing claptrap designed to make the Lewinsky scandal seem like old news. It was a mass-marketing version of the liberal habit of saying “the time for debate is over” — something liberals never say when the debate is politically helpful to them. Of course, once the country did in fact move on, MoveOn revealed what was always obvious to all of us “obsessed” “haters”: It was an entirely partisan, left-wing operation from soup to nuts. (Speaking of which, I wish someone would run for president under the name “Soup.” That way when writing about the polls I could write, “There’s a lot of interesting things happening among the really unconventional candidates from Soup to Deez Nuts.”) So it was of some small interest when I saw the coordinated response from Hillary’s posse immediately after her Meet the Press interview last Sunday. Here they all are, spontaneously saying the same thing: “time to move on.” What was so amusing was how they all seemed to pretend that this wasn’t a coordinated spin operation. Unfathomable Affection We all know the old rule of thumb for anyone who gets involved with Bill Clinton: “Get yourself tested.” A slightly less-well-known saying about Hillary Clinton: “There are no coincidences.” She didn’t just have a lucky run in the cattle-futures market, her billing records didn’t just show up in the West Wing, and Dorothy’s house didn’t simply land on her sister because of a freak accident. I’m sorry, that joke was uncalled for. But you do have to wonder what blind people think of Hillary Clinton when all they have to go by is that voice and that laugh. #share#Anyway, I’m really not obsessed with Hillary Clinton. In fact, one of the points I’ve been hammering like a zombie skull (if all I had to fight off zombies was a hammer) is that Hillary Clinton suffers from a charisma deficit, and by “deficit,” I mean a yawning chasm of charismalessness that descends into Stygian darkness to the point where if you dropped a stone — or even a 1978 AMC Pacer — into that metaphysical null set of charm, you would hear nothing but the subtle shushing of the wind as it vanished into the bottomless abyss. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton can be both fascinating and infuriating because he’s so damn smart. His ruthless ability to yoke both the angels and the demons swirling around him to the chariot of his political ambition makes him a worthy subject for biographers, psychologists, and secret monastic orders looking for signs of the End Times. So while Hillary holds no fascination for me whatsoever, Hillary adoration is endlessly intriguing. It is the Bronyism of the political world. (For those of you who don’t know what Bronies are, I’m sorry. After you click on this link, whatever esteem you had for mankind will be at least a little smaller. I think even the pope would allow a flicker of doubt of God’s plan after looking at it.) Look, she’s not dumb or weak. She’s not without talents. But, when I read, say, Lanny Davis’s suck-up e-mail to her — an e-mail of such profound sycophancy that it can really only be described in the vernacular of proctology — it makes me think of the “familiars” from the Blade movies. In the Blade universe, familiars are human servants of vampires, who will do anything to one day be rewarded with eternal life. Clinton’s sycophants aim a good deal lower. Lanny Davis wrote this: I consider you to be the best friend and the best person I have met in my long life. You know that from the dedication and appreciation of you I have always felt and expressed to you over four decades. And he even threw in this: Please please please * note there are *three pleases*: *Do not be bashful or concerned about saying no to my request. And here’s the amazing part: She still said no! Now, I’ve been through some rough moments in my life and my friends have been there for me (“I know you’re not talking about me” — The Couch). I’m not saying they’d take the rap for me if I killed someone or forgive me if it was revealed that I was the guy who cancelled Firefly. But you’d have to go pretty far down the list of my friends into the territory of Friendly Acquaintance Land, People I Held the Elevator Door Forsylvania, and Friends of Friends Whose Car I Puked In On Spring Breakstan before they’d refuse to say a nice word about me to a reporter if I begged them in a three page e-mail (never mind carried more water for them than Gunga Din for 30 years). And yet, like Frank Sinatra in  The Manchurian Candidate, I’m sure to this day if you asked Lanny what he thought about Hillary, he’d say “Hillary Clinton is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.” That’s weird man. And so are all the people who constantly insist that the “real Hillary” is charming and funny and all around awesome, as if someone in the limelight for 30 years could hide even a glimpse of this allegedly superhuman charm. The real Hillary seems as real to me as the Chess Team equipment manager’s horny Canadian super-model girlfriend. Bigfoot erotica makes more sense to me (and yes, that’s a real thing, too) because I at least know what they say about primates with big feet. The Smoking Server So why did I bring this up? Oh, right: this server story. I am getting a little obsessed with it. Perhaps not as much as my friend Shannen Coffin. Just the other night, his lovely wife called me in a panic because at Sunday dinner Shannen sculpted a perfect replica of Hillary’s server out of the mashed potatoes. #related#And as with Hillary fandom, what fascinates me is not the way Hillary lies constantly and with all the skill of John Candy on the parallel bars, but the way the Beltway establishment — led by her friends — is constantly looking for reasons not to see what is plainly in front of them. Take the constant refrain that each e-mail tranche contains “no smoking guns.” The other night on the Special Report online show I ranted about it with just a fraction of the energy stored in my splenetic-dilithium crystals, and Charles Krauthammer offered to write me a prescription for valium. I could go on all day about the layers of lies upon lies here. For instance: ‐There are plenty of smoking guns in every e-mail dump. The number of classified e-mails is now in the hundreds. ‐Hillary Clinton insisted in her first statement that she never sent or received any classified information. She knew this was a lie when she said it. Those were extremely prepared remarks. She only revised that to “marked” classified when the lie didn’t take. ‐The “marked classified” thing is a lie on the merits and in intent. Some e-mails were marked classified and it doesn’t matter if they were marked classified. The information was classified regardless of marking. She knew this. ‐She constantly says her system was allowed but never says who allowed it . . . because the person who allowed it was Hillary Clinton. She might as well have hung a banner over her desk that read, “Le département d’État, c’est moi!” (If one of you francophone pedants corrects my French here, I will drive out to your house and leave a burning bag of epoisses on your doorstep). But all this misses the point. I’m not normally an ALL CAPS kind of guy. So please forgive me for this: BUT THE SERVER IS THE SMOKING GUN! It’s all smokey-like, sitting right there in the FBI evidence room. I feel like the guy in the “To Serve Man” episode of The Twilight Zone shouting “It’s a cookbook” except that was at least a secret. To borrow a line from Thoreau, “Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk.” Hillary’s secret server is a trout bigger than the figurative Twinkee Egon Spengler described in Ghostbusters. And, I’ll just say it again, so as to avoid going bonkers: Saying there is no smoking gun is not a denial! If I accuse you of murdering your chiropodist and you immediately reply, “You have no smoking gun!” you’re basically admitting you did it. “There’s no smoking gun!” is the sort of rhetorical device used by serial killers in the Death Wish and Dirty Harry movies. “Ha ha! I’m going to get away with it!” And when I point this out to Clinton defenders who think “Hillary Clinton is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life,” they look at me with the same head-tilting bewilderment my dog displays when I patiently explain to her that a hexagon has six sides. Then after a long silence, they say, “It’s time to move on.” I gotta go make some mashed potatoes. After Oregon I didn’t intend to go on about all that for so long, so I will briefly chime in on a few of the other items in the news. I listened to Barack Obama’s remarks Thursday night about the Oregon shooting. I will say this in the president’s defense: He is obviously sincere. No decent person on either side of the gun-control debate isn’t weary and wounded in his or her soul after these mass shootings. I can only imagine how Obama feels when he has to offer his condolences to the victims and their families, particularly when he’s invincibly confident that he knows the solution to the problem. And that brings me to what makes him so infuriating. From the first days of his presidency, he has acted as if he has a unique and unimpeachable grasp of the right policy on every issue. When he says he’s open to ideas from other people, what he really means is he’s open to novel explanations for why he’s correct about everything. This certainty is dangerous for all sorts of reasons — a point George W. Bush’s critics used to wax sanctimonious about with mechanical regularity. But one of the reasons it is so vexing in Obama is that it lets him play games with the truth in order to get what he wants. For instance, he talked over and over again about how there are simple “commonsense” solutions that would protect gun rights. If only we could be like other advanced countries: We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. Well, do you know the state of gun rights in Great Britain and Australia? They are only marginally more robust than free-speech rights in Russia or Iran. He also said that there’s less gun violence in states with stricter gun-control laws. I don’t want to steal Charlie Cooke’s food bowl, but come on. Compare Washington, D.C., or Chicago to Burlington or Dallas. Yes, gun violence went down in New York City, but gun violence had been very high with the same gun-control laws. Stop and frisk, which liberals despise, had a lot more to do with declining gun deaths than gun control did. The most relevant gun-control rule in the Oregon shooting was the one that prevented law-abiding people from having guns on a “gun free zone” campus. So when he says it’s okay to “politicize” these tragedies, he means it in full. When Obama engages in politics, he distorts the truth, demonizes his opponents, and seeks any other weapon that may be near to hand. He does this because he sees politics not as a realm for compromise, but the means by which he achieves what he wants, because what he wants is the only right and just thing. Various & Sundry My column from yesterday is on the ongoing foreign-policy debacle that will continue to unfold until Obama leaves office. There’s an old rule in geopolitics which, if I remember correctly, dates back to Hugo Grotius. It goes something like this: When everybody starts quoting Fred Thompson in The Hunt  for Red October, it’s time to make sure the fecal guard protecting the rotor blades is in good working order. For some reason I think it works better in the original Latin. Still, if I were one of the companies hawking gold, silver, “food insurance,” or post-apocalyptic catheters on cable TV, I would be calling Fred Thompson right now begging him to be my pitchman for our next line of commercials. It’d begin with Thompson in a banker’s suit in front of an old-style TV. “Hello, I’m Fred Thompson. Remember this?” Cue footage of Admiral Painter in Red October on deck of aircraft carrier “Well, I’m here to tell you that this isn’t a movie. That’s why I think you should get a reverse mortgage today, take that money and buy some real security in the form of gold and meals ready to eat.”

http://www.nationalmemo.com/stuff-happens-jeb-and-trump-talk-down-gun-control/,"The two biggest-name Republican candidates clearly don’t like each other very much, but in the wake of the tragedy in Roseburg, Oregon they do appear to agree on one thing: There’s nothing we can do about mass shootings. During a phone interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Trump was asked what measures he would advocate for in order to prevent these events, such as more stringent background checks for gun purchases. “Well, first of all, you have very strong laws on the books — but you’re always going to have problems,” Trump answered. “I mean, we have millions and millions of people, we have millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world — and it does happen all over the world, by the way — but this is sort of unique to this country, the school shootings. And you’re going to have difficulty no matter what.” Upon some further questioning by panelist Willie Geist, as to whether Trump was saying that people will simply “slip through the cracks,” Trump agreed with that phrasing: “You are going to have difficulties. You are going to have difficulties with many different things — not just this. And that’s the way the world works — and by the way, that’s the way the world always has worked, Willie.” So who could possibly outdo Donald Trump in his blasé reaction to mass murder? Why, none other than his establishment GOP arch-nemesis, Jeb Bush. At a conservative forum in South Carolina on Friday, Jeb had this to say, after an audience member complained about liberals’ insistence on gun control. (The questioner also lamented that there weren’t prayer vigils at schools before these events happen — since that would be a more useful way to prevent school shootings.) We’re in a difficult time in our country, and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It’s just — it’s very sad to see. But I resist — I had this challenge as governor. We had — look — stuff happens — there’s always a crisis. The impulse is to do something, and it’s not always the right thing to do. The short version, “Stuff happens,” quickly went viral online. Here is video that’s been posted online. (Note: Audio quality is poor, with very low volume.) When asked afterward whether what he had just said was a mistake, Bush stood by it: “No, it wasn’t a mistake — I said exactly what I said. Why would you — explain to me what I said wrong… Things happen all the time — ‘things,’ is that better?” Well, at least it’s good to know that someone named Bush thinks it’s wrong, after a terrible crisis, for the government to take a drastic, unconsidered action simply to satisfy the impulse to do something. At President Obama’s press conference Friday afternoon, Jonathan Karl of ABC News read back a key part of Bush’s response, and then asked Obama for his reaction. “I don’t even think I have to react to that one,” Obama answered curtly, to laughter from the press corps. “I think the American people should hear that, and make their own judgments, based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.'” Know first. The opinions that matter.

The outraged journalists at NBC, ABC and CBS on Wednesday slammed the “controversial,” “beyond insensitive” Ben Carson for his comments about last week’s shooting in Oregon. Their anger provides a strong contrast to controversial statements by Hillary Clinton in recent days. Carson urged people in a mass shooting situation to attack the gunman, prompting Today co-host Natalie Morales to rage, “It's beyond insensitive. It's hard to hear that.” Co-host Willie Geist huffed, “But my goodness, who would ever second guess people in that situation?” Tamron Hall agreed, saying, “I don’t understand it.”  An NBC graphic identified, “Ben Carson's Controversial Comments on Guns.” Over on Good Morning America, co-host George Stephanopoulos declared, “Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson feels the heat for comments on gun control.” Reporter Cecilia Vega knocked the “controversial comments.” Piling on, Vega also reminded, “Now, this is not the first controversial comment this candidate has made, George. You will remember Carson said he didn't think a Muslim should be president.” An ABC graphic turned a picture of the surgeon black and white, making him seem sinister. (See picture at right.) On CBS This Morning, Charlie Rose echoed, “Ben Carson is lighting up the gun control debate with controversial comments on mass shootings.” In an interview with the candidate, Gayle King lectured Carson from the left, insisting, “At the time of the Second Amendment though they were talking about muskets they weren't talking about the AK 47s and the high-powered rifles that we have today.”  In contrast, when Clinton made a controversial linking of Republicans to the Holocaust, suggesting they want to put illegals in “boxcars,” the networks ignored the remark. On Monday, when Clinton strongly came out for new gun control laws, it was not deemed controversial. Instead, the networks hailed the “emotional” Democrat who was “on fire” with a “tough new stance.” A transcript of the October 7 Today segment is below:  9:01am ET WILLIE GEIST: Let's jump into some presidential politics. Dr. Ben Carson is a guy who’s surprised a lot of people. He’s at or near many of the national polls, tied with Donald Trump in some of them. And he lit up the gun control debate with some new comments on mass shootings, of course, reflecting on last week's terrible day in Oregon. Here’s what Dr. Carson said on Fox & Friends about how he would have responded if a gunman asked him, “What religion are you?” BEN CARSON: Not only would I probably not cooperate with them, I would – I would not just stand there and let them shoot me. I would say, “Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me but he can't get us all.” [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: “I Would Not Just Stand There”; Ben Carson’s Controversial Comments on Guns] GEIST: He said that this morning – or yesterday morning, and then reiterated it had again when he was asked again and again. A lot of people taking great offense to someone stepping back from the comfort of a presidential campaign and saying, “Here's what I would have done,” as nine people were shot. Many of them reportedly asked what their religion was, when they said “Christian,” they were gunned down. NATALIE MORALES: Yeah. I mean, it's beyond insensitive. It's hard to hear that. TAMRON HALL: Well, Bill Kristol, the conservative columnist, obviously a legend in the conservative world, attempted to defend the remarks this morning on Morning Joe, the show that Willie’s on as well, and his point was that Dr. Carson was not saying that these victims did anything wrong. MORALES: Right. HALL: That he was pointing, for example, 9/11, with Flight – United Flight 93, when we know those passengers fought back. That's at least one person's explanation, perhaps, for Dr. Carson's remarks. MORALES: Right. HALL: But then he went on and made similar comments on another program, Dr. Carson did. GEIST: Yeah, I think just as a rule, don't explain what you would have done in a moment none of us could imagine in our worst nightmares. MORALES: You don't know how you're going to react, yeah. AL ROKER: I think if he wants to comment on it, good for him, but I think there are many people who would probably say, “You know what, I'm not in those people's shoes, I'm not going to even begin to presume.” HALL: And isn't it more important that we hear your policy proposals, potentially, on this conversation, a more substantive conversation, rather than if-then scenarios that certainly lead people to assume that you are saying that these poor people who lost their lives were passive and that you somehow would have been aggressive. , MORALES: And that wasn't the point I think he was intending to say, that you know, these people were not passive. I think it was just more his idea of if we, you know, work together and take down the shooter – but, yeah. HALL: But when the shooter's armed with a semiautomatic weapon – that wasn't the case in this Oregon shooting, but other times. But the bottom line, again, is one of those conversations that we have. I always think when we all watch the same video and the majority of people go, “What did he say?” That's usually not – we're not all crazy here. GEIST: Part of his explanation last night when he was asked again about it on a different show was that, “I want to plant the seed for the next victim so that they react in a different way.” But my goodness, who would ever second guess people in that situation? HALL: Yes, I don't understand it. GEIST: You mentioned policy. Part of it is here. Dr. Carson suggested in an interview with USA Today that if he had a child in kindergarten he would want school security guards and even possibly that child's teacher to be armed, saying, “If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had – if they had one than if they didn't.” Later in the day he appeared on The View and was asked to clarify that comment. [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: The Gun Debate; Should Teachers in Schools be Armed?] CARSON: Not all kindergarten teachers, I said people who are trained and understand all the implications. And you obviously are not just going to have a weapon sitting on the kindergarten teacher's desk. And I know that’s- JOY BEHAR: So where would the weapon be? CARSON: It would be secured in a place where kids could not get to it. BEHAR: So if a gunman comes in – if a gunman comes in with an AK-45 or AR-15, how fast can that teacher go to the locked drawer and get that gun? CARSON: Well, I want that teacher trained. BEHAR: You want that teacher trained. CARSON: I want that teacher trained in diversionary tactics and whatever needs to be done in order to get there. GEIST: By the way, that's not an unpopular position. ROKER: No. GEIST: If you poll- MORALES: Yeah. There are a lot of people, yeah, who feel this way. GEIST: There's a strong argument to be made that you could employ a retired police officer or a veteran who’s looking for work to be in the parking lot in cat and be a security guard at a school. ROKER: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. HALL: But the other argument, guys, of that is that there were armed security people at Columbine. GEIST: Right. HALL: And so, again, that's a part of the substantive conversation that you can have, but it has to be an informed conversation, and when people say and support the statement from Dr. Carson –  and point out many people do – there is the other side of Columbine. MORALES: It's just such a sad commentary on, you know, where we are in the world today. HALL: Absolutely. We're desperate to find a safe way. MORALES: We’re having to have a conversation about arming our teachers and I think a lot of people are having that conversation now across the country. But at the same time, it just makes you, as a parent, sick to your stomach the thought that you have to think that way now. Now our schools have – you know, I know my school just put multiple security features on top of what was already there. And that’s the reality that we live in. HALL: I don't know if you saw this Oregon mom. Her daughter was inside the community college, Umpqua, when this happened, and she said very clearly that if her daughter had been armed she feels that her daughter could have helped out, and there she is a parent frightened to death that she lost her daughter. MORALES: Right. HALL: And she strongly believed, and to your point about, you know, this is something that many people support. She said, “If my daughter – I wish my daughter had been armed.” MORALES: Yeah. HALL: And that's a parent speaking. ROKER: We're not gonna solve this, obviously, but there's a lot of back and forth that's going to continue. The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425211/ben-carson-right-charge-attackers-dont-shelter-place-david-french,"Follow Us National Review Clarence Thomas’s Monumental Legacy Do We Have Freedom of Speech, Really? The Kind Soul of Clarence Thomas The Two Countercultures Clarence Thomas, an American Justice Common sense apparently does strange things to some progressive minds. Yesterday morning, speaking on Fox and Friends, Ben Carson said of a mass-shooting situation, “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” The New York Times declared that his statement was “drawing widespread rebuke from his critics and reviving questions about his candidacy.” ABC News asked him to “clarify” his statement, leading to this rather amusing exchange: ABC: Dr. Carson can you clarify your statements on the Oregon shooting? Carson: What needs clarification? ABC: I guess there’s an implication that you’re saying that the students didn’t do enough to save themselves. Carson: No, I said nothing about them. I said what I would do. ABC: And can you say what you would do? Carson: I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time. That way we don’t all wind up dead. He then laughed and walked away. Later, on Megyn Kelly’s show, he said that he wasn’t laughing at the shooting but rather the “silliness” of the people asking the question. He said that he wanted to “plant the seed in people’s minds so that if this happens again they don’t all get killed.”  There was a time when the guidance for passengers in airplane hijackings could be summed up in one word: Cooperate. And on September 11, 2001, hijackers used that guidance to guarantee their control of three airplanes — the planes that later flew straight into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. But on one aircraft, the passengers learned that cooperation meant certain death, and they unilaterally changed the protocols. As a result, it’s now virtually unthinkable that American passengers will simply stand by and allow a hijacker to seize an airliner’s controls. RELATED: On Man’s Duty to Defend the Weak and Vulnerable To hail the passengers of Flight 93 is not to condemn the passengers of Flight 11, Flight 175, and Flight 77. In a terrifying situation, they were doing what they were taught to do. #share#The current guidance for victims in mass-shooting situations is just as passive as the original guidance for hijacking victims. “Shelter in place,” they’re told. In other words, hide and wait for rescue. Carson is urging a change in the paradigm, to immediate group resistance. The key word here is “group.” The sad stories of mass shootings are replete with tales of individual heroism, of the one man who charged the attacker only to be shot down. In Oregon, Chris Mintz resisted and was shot multiple times. At Fort Hood, Captain John Gaffney reportedly died charging Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. But where one man fails, two or three can succeed — just ask Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler, the three American men who foiled an August terrorist attack on a French train. #related#Should the defining characteristic of Americans under fire — whether from terrorists or from depraved gunmen — be their eagerness to shelter or their courage to resist? And should a presidential candidate prioritize “sensitivity” over all other virtues? Carson is urging Americans to change their thinking, to take responsibility for their own defense. In a previous era, this would be called leadership. Now, all too many people just call it mean. As I’ve said before, none of us can truly know how we’ll respond to a crisis until we face that ultimate test, but aspiration is the first step to action, and we can and should urge our fellow Americans to fight — together, immediately, and viciously — when confronted by a mortal threat. “Shelter in place” is supposed to mean “wait for help.” All too often it means “wait to die.” Those are not American words. They are not in keeping with American culture. On Flight 93, the battle cry was “Let’s roll.” On a train in Belgium, it was “Let’s go.” Those are the right words — the American words — for defeating evil.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/06/presidential_tantrums_wont_end_gun_violence_128312.html,"WASHINGTON -- Following the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, a ""smoldering"" (as one commentator put it) President Obama gave a revealing speech -- a clarification, a culmination, of much that had come before. ""What has become routine,"" he said, ""of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of commonsense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. 'We need more guns,' they'll argue. ... Does anybody believe that?"" ""This is a political choice we make,"" he claimed, ""to allow this to happen every few months in America."" The president's frustration, after delivering a sad series of similar speeches, is understandable. But his argument is still indefensible. Even if you support ""commonsense gun legislation"" (as I do), there was nothing in Obama's speech that effectively argued for it. No policy proposals or serious justifications. No one listening to the speech would be persuaded to take a position he or she did not already hold. Obama was saying, in essence, that it is obvious what we should do about mass gun violence, that evil people are blocking it, and that they have innocent blood on their hands. This is apparently what some liberal people think when anger releases them from civility and rationality. Obama speaks as if the gun laws he wants passed would put an end to these killings -- a position for which there is no evidence. I believe that more thorough background checks and further restrictions on the type and firepower of weapons, along with improved health services for the severely mentally ill, would be good for our society, apart from mass killings. I hope that, in the long term, this system might, just might, intervene before a prospective mass killer strikes (though such causality would be very hard to demonstrate). But I have no basis for the calumny that people who disagree with me are choosing to allow mass murder. This is the politics of moral posturing, not an argument rooted in social science. With his last election behind him, Obama is free to be Obama. And it appears that he is, deep down, a liberal commentator of the MSNBC variety -- perhaps providing a preview of his post-presidency. The only apparent purpose of his gun speech was to incite the faithful by expressing a seething arrogance. Obama would surely blame the other side for the sorry state of our politics. Didn't Mitch McConnell have it out for him from the beginning? Hasn't every attempted compromise been slapped away? But it matters when the president of the United States decides that democratic persuasion is a fool's game. It encourages the kind of will-to-power politics we see on the left and right. In this view, opponents are evil -- entirely beyond the normal instruments of reason and good faith. So the only option is the collection and exercise of power. When the main players in our politics give up on deliberative democracy, it feels like some Rubicon is being crossed. Our system is designed for leaders who make arguments for their views, seek compromise and try different policy angles to break logjams. And when they lose, their proper recourse is ... to make more arguments, seek other compromises and try different policy angles. At this time, gun control legislation would probably not pass. Because such a law would not directly prevent mass murders (even if the law had useful purposes). Because Obama doesn't know how to work with Congress. Because the National Rifle Association would oppose it. Because the political environment is not right. But someone who supports gun control should still argue for it, because that is what we do in a democracy. The spirit of our democracy is very much at issue. Donald Trump says we have a corrupt system run by stupid people. Obama says we have a corrupt system run by evil people. Both of them are part of the same problem. I really don't give a damn if they are disillusioned and fed up with democratic processes or not. If they are tired of the game, they should stop playing it, not engage in ideological commentary or entertain fantasies of personal rule. The best way to restore faith in our democratic structures is to spend a lifetime trying to make them work, like Hubert Humphrey did, or Jack Kemp did, or Henry Jackson did, or Ronald Reagan did, or Ted Kennedy did. But it is easier, and surely satisfying in its own way, to throw a tantrum when democracy disappoints you. (c) 2015, Washington Post Writers Group (c) 2015, Washington Post Writers Group"

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/02/guess_which_issue_gop_candidates_dont_want_to_discuss_after_the_latest_mass_shooting/,"""Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue,"" the President said during an impassioned and frustrated speech addressing the latest mass shooting at a small community college in Oregon yesterday. ""Well this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic,"" President Obama insisted. A gunman killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, and injured seven more before being shot by police. As President Obama urged news organization to show the statistics of gun deaths and deaths caused by acts of terrorism for a side-by-side comparison, and called on Americans to hold their lawmakers accountable for inaction on what he called an epidemic, presidential candidates on the 2016 trail have taken strikingly different positions on the prevention of gun violence. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders took decidedly different tones addressing the 45th school shooting this year -- the 994th mass shooting in just the last three years, but seemingly arrived at remarkably similarly grim conclusions about the likelihood to affect change. ""We're tired of sending condolences and we know that it could happen tomorrow, it could happen again a month from now,"" Sanders told MSNBC's Chris Hayes, echoing President Obama's sentiments. “I know him well enough to know that this was very personal for him,"" Sanders said of President Obama, who delivered his 15th national address in the aftermath of a mass shooting. ""He is disgusted, he is angry, he is sick and tired — as we all are — of sending our condolences to the families of people who have been murdered in cold blood.” But when Sanders was pressed by Hayes on his vote against the Brady bill and past endorsement from the NRA, Sanders offered this bit of nuance: I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is. What we do know is the current situation is not tenable. It is clearly not working. And as the president indicated, we can and must do a lot better … You can sit there and say I think we should do this and do that. But you’ve got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.  Rather than sounding impassioned to act following news of the shooting, the normally blustery Trump took on a more resigned tone. ""So many of these people, they're coming out of the woodwork,"" Trump told the Washington Post's Phillip Bump.""It's happening more and more. I just don't remember -- years back, I just don't remember these things happening. Certainly not with this kind of frequency,"" Trump said, calling this latest incident ""another mental health problem."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty and that will be for the next million years, there's going to be difficulty and people are going to slip through the cracks,"" Trump said. Trump argued that ""we have to really get to the bottom of it,"" but seemed to dismiss the need for any further regulations on gun ownership, eventually endorsing no plan of action. ""First of all, you have very strong laws on the books,"" Trump said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""[B]ut you're always going to have problems. We have millions and millions of people, we have millions and millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world and it does happen all over the world, by the way. But this is sort of unique to this country, the school shootings. And you're going to have difficulty no matter what."" Rival Jeb Bush was actually the first 2016 candidate on either side to comment on the shooting, offering his prayers on Twitter without even referencing the mass shooting: A host of other Republican presidential candidates followed suit, offering their condolences via Twitter while staying far away from talk of guns or gun control: Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley called out his fellow presidential aspirants on the Republican side: Speaking with local Boston reporter Janet Wu, Hillary Clinton pledged to lead the formation of a pro-gun control group to rival the NRA. ""I'm going to try and do everything that I can as president to raise up an equally as large and vocal group that is going to prove to be a counterbalance,"" Clinton said. The campaigns of Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie haven't even commented on the shooting at all. Rubio, if you recall, was notably mum following this summer's gun massacre in Charleston: At least Ohio Governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich had the decency to accurately describe the tragedy as a shooting: Other Republican candidates did tackle the issue of gun control, but only to knock down the idea. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson happened to be on right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt’s program following news of the shooting and promptly denied that gun control could help to prevent such an incident. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” Carson said. “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.” He argued that instead of focusing on guns, “early warning clues” should be heeded by people closer to the shooter in order to prevent such shootings. Bobby Jindal also offered his condolences during the ""Hugh Hewitt Show"" while the news was breaking but quickly touted his NRA endorsement to fend off talk of further gun control and to denounce the so-called politicization of gun deaths: I’m not for additional restrictions on law abiding citizens. What we’ve done in Louisiana, and this is endorsed by the NRA, we passed a law a few years ago that made sure that the mental health records of those that for example have been forcefully admitted into a mental hospital, those that have been through a process, whether it’s a judicial process or another process, that those records are entered into their national background check system, because there are folks that are, under our current laws, you know, if they didn’t do that process, if a court has decided that they’re not supposed to have guns, they’re not allowed to buy those guns. And we did that law to make sure those records were entered into the system. What I’m not for, too many times politicians try to use these tragic events as an excuse to pursue their agendas when it comes to gun control. I’m not for restrictions on law abiding Americans’ right to have guns. I think we’ve got to be very careful. There needs to be a due process. There needs to be, and in this case, there is. We passed a law to make sure those records would be entered into the national background check system. Desperate Mike Huckabee went with the tried and true attack on President Obama for being ""quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda,"" in his latest Facebook rant. Huckabee did at least offer up one ""solution"" -- albeit one that would allow for more, not less guns -- suggesting the prohibition of gun free zones. ""Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants, but it's clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones,"" he wrote:  We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy - What kind of gun was used? How did the shooter obtain... Posted by Mike Huckabee on Thursday, October 1, 2015    Sophia Tesfaye is Salon's senior editor for news and politics, and resides in Washington, D.C.

http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/donald_trumps_cold_blooded_genius_how_fatalism_on_gun_violence_plays_right_into_the_nras_hands/,"Whenever there's a mass shooting, we can count on two things to happen. First, nothing. Nothing will happen. No matter how horrendous the shooting happens to be, the National Rifle Association has rendered Congress entirely impotent, ensuring nothing will happen to prevent another would-be gunman from easily purchasing firearms. Not even the cold-blooded murder of 20 kindergarteners or the live on-air murder of two journalists has successfully shaken our political leaders from their NRA-induced torpor. Second, the NRA's flying monkeys inevitably fan out across the country, disbursing the usual talking points about mental health, arming schoolteachers and outlawing gun-free zones, all as a distraction from the real issue, which is, of course, ridiculously easy access to firearms. The mental health issue, in this context, is horseshit. In spite of how often they lean on this particular button in the wake of a shooting, the Republicans haven't done a damn thing about addressing mental health. Ever. In fact, it was a Democrat, the late Paul Wellstone, who championed the notion of making mental illness a legitimate health matter. It was also a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president who included mental health coverage as an Obamacare mandate -- covering nearly 4 million Americans who previously didn't have mental health insurance. The Republicans, on the other hand, have voted to repeal Obamacare upward of 60 times, while attempting to block the Wellstone amendment. If they were really concerned about mental illnesses contributing to gun massacres, you'd think there'd be something in the works to mitigate the problem by delivering more medical care to the people who need it the most. Nope. Not a chance. So, leave it to Donald Trump to shift an already badly skewed debate from mental illness to, somehow, evil geniuses. Yes, Trump blamed gun massacres on shooters who are ""geniuses in a certain way."" They're masterminds, he said, who can ""break the system."" “No matter what you do, you’re gonna have problems,” Trump told NBC News in an interview that aired Sunday. “Because you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they’re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.” Not only are the shooters geniuses, but there's really nothing we can do to stop them, said Trump. Gone are Trump's usual over-the-top superlatives about how he has a ""terrific"" plan to stop gun violence -- that there's going to be so few kindergarteners shot when he's president, our heads will spin. None of that. Trump's reaction? Oh well. He might be a complete fraud, but he sounds a hell of a lot like a Republican here. It's frankly worse than Jeb Bush's unfortunate ""stuff happens"" reaction. Indeed, Trump went one step further by suggesting that stuff happens and nothing can be done about it because mass shooters are basically Batman villains who can ""break the system,"" apparently using green laughing gas and an entourage of anonymous, masked henchmen. Contra Trump, what we absolutely shouldn't be doing now, especially given how one mass shooter happens to inspire the next mass shooter, is stroking the apparent intelligence of these murderers. Whether true or not, the last thing we ought to be doing is pointing to guys like Adam Lanza or Chris Harper-Mercer and treating them like MENSA candidates. More from Trump: “It’s a horrible thing to say,” he added. “And it’s not even politically correct. But it’s common sense. You’re going to have problems no matter how good, no matter what kind of checks you do, you know, what kind of laws.” No matter what we do, Trump said, stuff will still happen. Fascinating coming from a front-runnner for the presidency who thinks a border fence -- complete with a ""beautiful big door"" -- will end the allegedly immigrant-based violence in Baltimore and Chicago. So, evidently, there's an actual solution to gun violence as long as it includes vilifying brown people with a new Berlin-style wall. But when it comes to preventing these mostly white mass shooters from easily stockpiling obscenely large arsenals of firearms, whatevs. Trump possesses neither a conscience nor any core values whatsoever, making him capable of blurting literally anything. This blurt, in particular, is especially egregious. But it fits nicely within his contradictory, half-assed positions on the Second Amendment. One of those positions, as published on his website, states that we shouldn't expand background checks until we fix what he believes is a broken system. This is not unlike suggesting that a professional football team shouldn't sign better receivers until the quarterback recovers from a mildly strained hamstring, but OK. Yet, at the same time, he declared that it really doesn't matter how strong the system is because the geniuses will always find a way around it. Put another way: Trump thinks we should fix the broken system, but it doesn't matter if we do because ""you're going to have problems, no matter how good"" the system is. As infuriating and insensitive as it might be, Trump's gun position is precisely the GOP position, only he doesn't mind blurting it out loud, nor does he mind sounding like a self-contradicting nincompoop in the process. And rest assured, Wayne LaPierre is perched in his underground lair, writing a series of campaign contribution checks to Trump as we speak. All told, Trump has managed to top the old ""mental health"" excuse in the wake of various gun massacres. Even if we address mental health, he believes, the shooters will still break the system. It's a line we should expect the rest of the GOP to embrace presently because it's kind of, in a sinister way, also genius. There's an increasing sense of futility on both sides of the gun debate, and Trump's position plays directly into it. Why bother? Nothing will happen. Sure it won't, because the system is broken and there's nothing we can do about, so we might as well take our toys and go home. And if that happens, the NRA wins. Flawless victory.

http://theslot.jezebel.com/carson-thinks-loss-of-gun-rights-would-be-more-devastat-1734915211,"In a Facebook Q&A on Monday, presidential candidate and real-life zombie Ben Carson wrote that while he’d “spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies,” he “never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” Yes, well, to be fair, if you’re already 99% dead inside, it’s probably hard to break out of your torpor to experience empathy, or rational thought. Carson was responding to a question about whether the recent mass shooting in Oregon had changed his views on the Second Amendment, and he also had this to say: “The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda. To me, that is also devastatingly sad.” To recap, here are the things Ben Carson believes are more devastating than violent death: Carson also informed USA Today on Tuesday that if he had a child in kindergarten, he would feel “much more comfortable” if their teacher was armed. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if Ben Carson retreated to an Assisted Living Home for Addled Former Geniuses, but we can’t all get what we want this election season.

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/17/hillarys-gun-confiscation-proposal-will-probably-backfire-in-a-big-way/,"Allahpundit wrote yesterday about Hillary Clinton’s startling lurch to the left on guns. The story dealt largely with her fascinating suggestion that the United States should look at a “buyback program” similar to Australia’s draconian laws which they instituted in 1996 following a mass shooting in Tasmania. (Barack Obama made the same reference last year, by the way, though it never went anywhere.) As AP noted, this wasn’t a gun buy back program such as many states and municipalities have offered. It was mandatory confiscation with a modest cash reimbursement to soften the blow. Before moving on to the latest news on this story, it’s worth noting (particularly for Hillary Clinton’s campaign office) that the immediate results of the Australian gun grab were pretty much the opposite of what was advertised. Gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first year results: In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent. Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns. This rather radical idea was expected to draw a quick response and it clearly did. Hillary made it very clear at multiple appearances that she planned on running to the left of Bernie Sanders on the gun issue and that she would pick out the most obvious demon to slay for the entertainment of her liberal base: the NRA. The problem with taking on such a massive and obvious target is that they tend to hit back. As the New York Times reports, the organization’s rapid response team was all over Hillary with a truth-storm before the news crews could pack up their cameras after her appearance. On Friday, the powerful lobbying group gave her a fight. It accused Mrs. Clinton of supporting “gun confiscation,” after she expressed interest in a gun buyback program that led to the elimination of the majority of Australia’s firearms… In a statement, Chris Cox, the N.R.A.’s chief lobbyist, said that Mrs. Clinton’s comments validated the fears of gun owners and that her “extreme views are completely out of touch with the American people.” “The real goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation,” Mr. Cox said. “Hillary Clinton, echoing President Obama’s recent remarks on the same issue, made that very clear.” NRA-ILA was out with a more forceful response within the hour. No, the Australian and U.K. “buybacks” were merely an attempt to mollify firearm owners whose property had been declared contraband and subject to seizure. They were, to paraphrase Vito Corleone, an offer gun owners could not refuse. The owners had the “choice” to accept the money and turn the guns they had previously been forced to register (supposedly so they could keep them under grandfather provisions), or they could risk the government forcibly confiscating the guns and being sent to prison for possessing them (supposing, of course, that they survived the confiscation attempt itself). If you own a gun now, take heed. President Obama and now Hillary Clinton finally made clear what they’re really after – national gun confiscation. As AP already noted, this is a winning strategy for Clinton in the primary because her base has largely been sold on the idea of things like expanded background checks at the federal level and a national gun registry. (!) How they will react to actual gun confiscation from law abiding owners remains to be seen. But when it comes to the general election, Clinton has a serious storm brewing on the horizon. Regarding a ban on all semi-automatic weapons, including handguns, the public has been consistent in their response for decades. As of last year there was 73% opposition to such a ban, and 63% said that a home was safer if there was a gun in the house. Those numbers don’t shift when there is a mass shooting. They never do in any significant way. So with all that in mind, I think we need to encourage Hillary to pick up this flag and run with it. In fact, I’m going to go on record as supporting Hillary to be the nominee for the Democrats next year. This is just what the Democrats need and I look forward to her explaining her gun confiscation plans to the public when she debates the eventual GOP nominee. That ship is going to sink so fast it will make the Titanic look like a sure bet to make it to New York. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/09/1429989/-Ben-Carson-says-Umpqua-survivor-had-anti-Ben-Carson-comments-fed-to-him,"The comment came in response to Wolf Blitzer’s question about a statement made by Matthew Downing, one of the survivors of the Oregon shooting. Downing said on Facebook that “nobody could truly understand what actions they would take like that in a situation unless they lived it.” Carson speculated that Downing’s comments were “fed to him” by someone who misconstrued what he meant when he said he would have risen up to attack the shooter. For Dr. Ben Carson to suppose all of that was just a buildup to some anti-Ben Carson force maybe marginally insulting Dr. Ben Carson is self-absorbed even by Dr. Ben Carson standards. Oh, but he's still keen on this idea that the only way we're going to stop mass shootings in this country is by teaching all our school children and college students to bum-rush the shooter until he runs out of bullets to keep murdering them with. Carson’s comments are actually contrary to government protocol. The Department of Homeland Security recommends attempting to evacuate or hide before attacking a shooter — something that should only be done “as a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger.” There are two kinds of Republican politicians in America today. The ones that know when they have said something stupid and, perhaps with the help of their advisers and a ball gag, clam up about it and hope it blows over, and the ones that believe the answer to saying something stupid is to keep saying even stupider things until somehow it all works itself out. Guess which one is currently in vogue."
http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/425329/ben-carson-half-right-about-guns-and-holocaust-charles-c-w-cooke,"Follow Us National Review A Telling Anecdote from Clarence Thomas 30 Years of Justice Clarence Thomas BREAKING: Supreme Court Sets November 1 Oral Argument on Texas Abortion Case Americans Should Be More Upset about Infrastructure Inefficiency What You Missed Last Night Ben Carson has upset everyone again: Ben Carson said Thursday that Adolf Hitler’s mass murder of Jews “would have been greatly diminished” if German citizens had not been disarmed by the Nazi regime. The comment, which came during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, was similar to arguments Carson made following last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in which he defended the Second Amendment and suggested that the victims should have fought the gunman. . . . “I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,” Carson said. Blitzer pushed a bit more: “Because they had a powerful military machine, as you know, the Nazis.” “I understand that,” Carson said. “I’m telling you that there is a reason that these dictatorial people take the guns first.” Before getting into the details of this claim, I must confess to being unsure as to why the mere mention of this era offends people as keenly as it does. In his comments, Carson was presenting a counterfactual hypothesis. Maybe it’s a bad one and he’s wrong. Maybe it’s a good one and he’s right. But why the anger? If you don’t like his case — or you think it’s stupid — then explain why he’s incorrect. Don’t freak out just because he said the word “Nazi.” Godwin’s law exists to mock those who refer to the Third Reich when it doesn’t apply. It’s not a general prohibition on the discussion of Nazism. Now, is Carson incorrect? Possibly, yes. It is true that the Nazi regime disarmed the Jews — and to the extent that it prohibited them from owning even knives. That fact, though, does not in and of itself mean that the Holocaust could have been prevented. Given what I know about the sentiments held by the population at large and about the remarkable efficiency of both the military and the police, it seems unlikely to me that any organized resistance could have prevailed — at least not to the extent that it could have overthrown the German state or facilitated the escape of millions of people. Unlike during the American revolution, there was no strong undercurrent of liberalism that undercut the efforts of the authorities, and, besides, many of those who were exterminated didn’t know what was happening to them until it was too late. In pockets there might have been stories of heroism and uprising, sure. In fact, there were. But Carson’s claim was “greatly diminished,” not just “diminished,” and it can therefore be judged on those grounds. But here’s the thing: Whether Carson is right or wrong in his central claim is entirely irrelevant to the more important question here, which is not “can armed people always overthrow a tyrannical government” but “does the government get to deny them the chance to try?” The right to keep and bear arms is an individual right, not a collective privilege, and individual rights do not need to be justified on practical grounds. Just as we would not deny free speech to a man simply because he seemed unlikely to win a given argument, we must not abandon our auxiliary self-defense rights on the basis that the odds might be stacked against the little guy. I’m a staunch defender of the right to keep and bear arms because I have an untouchable Lockean right to protect myself, not because I can prove definitively that I will never be outgunned. Would I necessarily win in a fight against a home intruder? No, I would not. Would I necessarily survive if the government or the police wanted me dead? No, I would not. But I will assert my unalienable right to try against any man at any time in any place, and those who hope to strip me of that chance can man up, head to my front door, and come and damn well take it.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/28/fear_128575.html,"This Halloween, what do you fear? I fear fear itself because when we are afraid, we willingly give away our freedoms. Global warning? More power to the EPA! 9/11? Vote 100 to 0 to create a TSA! Kids don't learn? Common Core! Crime up? Spend on police! (Or for leftists: increase welfare!) Immigrants? Seal the border! Ebola? More money and power for public health programs! Government thrives on our fears. When we're scared, politicians are always there, promising to protect us if we just give them more money and power. We usually do. I got into an argument about that with the hosts of the Fox show ""Outnumbered,"" which pits one man against four women in debate. The ""Outnumbered"" hosts are not the usual silly socialist media alarmists. They often report on the harm big government does. But last summer, with government warning about Ebola being an ""incredibly transmissible"" disease and media shrieking, ""Are hospitals ready?"" all four women were alarmed. They wanted government to do something. Quarantine? Ban flights from Africa? Hire more doctors? Government must do something! I pushed back, saying, ""You women get too scared; you exaggerate the risk."" I know that was sexist. But I also think it's true -- women fear more. Am I wrong? I'm open to counter-argument. I told the TV hosts that I believed more Americans would be killed by deer than Ebola. They laughed at me, but I was serious, and in fact, that year only one American died from Ebola, but almost 200 were killed by deer (most from their cars colliding with deer). But we don't fear deer. This Saturday, no one will wear scary deer costumes. No Halloween party will feature scary replicas of cars. We're accustomed to cars and deer. New threats frighten us -- and threats that seem new. Like school shootings. After the last horrible mass shooting, Hillary Clinton implied that school has become more dangerous. She demanded new gun controls, asking, ""How many people have to die before we actually act?"" Every shooting is terrible, and governments often respond by hiring increased security and running ""lockdown drills"" that terrify kids. Politicians say these steps are needed because mass shootings are up. But they are not. School violence is actually down. There were almost four times as many deaths back in 1994. People fear today's resurgence of violent crime. The head of the FBI says he thinks the ""War on Cops"" led some officers to be less aggressive, and that's why crime has risen a little in some cities. But he had no hard evidence to back up what he said. Crime is up in a few cities, but the percentage increase is dramatic only because the crime rates in those cities had fallen very low. ""Take New York City. Homicides up 8 percent this year,"" says Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox, ""but it's 35 percent lower than five years ago."" Overall, crime continues to fall. Really. The FBI just released the most recent data, which says violent crime is down. Again. But what about that ""War on Cops""? It's true that in some neighborhoods, police making arrests often face an angry crowd screaming ""racism,"" and 32 officers have been killed with guns this year. That's tragic, but it's not an increase. Actually, today is an especially safe time to be a police officer. Adjusted for the change in population, 2013 saw fewer police deaths than any year since 1887, and if this year's trend continues, 2015 will have the lowest number of police killings in decades. Fear is a friend of the state. When people are frightened, they willingly give money and power to politicians and bureaucrats. That's what I fear this Halloween.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/26/fiorina_needs_another_good_debate_128535.html,"The Republican primary debates have served as fuel for Carly Fiorina’s long-shot presidential bid. The businesswoman’s standout performances in Cleveland and Simi Valley, Calif., have helped transform her from an underdog into a viable contender. Her poll numbers rose significantly in the immediate aftermath of both debates, and sizable cash donations followed. But as she heads to Round 3 in Boulder, Colo., this week, there is perhaps more pressure on her than ever before. A handful of recent national polls show Fiorina’s post-debate bump has faded, while candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson have maintained, and in some cases, increased, their leads. What’s more, another competitor, Marco Rubio, continues to rise. The next debate offers the former Hewlett-Package CEO a chance to regain her stride. But her greater challenge is to better capitalize on that performance and prove her campaign is more than a series of bright but ephemeral moments on the grand stage. The Fiorina campaign argues that the candidate’s upward trajectory from her start is more significant than the short-term ups and downs that have followed. And, as most campaigns believe, hers stresses that activity and standing in the early voting states matter more than national grades. According to the RealClearPolitics polling averages, Fiorina places in the top five contenders in Iowa (where she is tied with Jeb Bush), New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida. She has been actively focused on those early states, and her stump schedule is demanding enough to wear out the fittest of contenders. Fiorina has done 72 events in Iowa alone this cycle, according to the Des Moines Register’s candidate tracker. Only Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, who are essentially camped out in the state but still lagging in the polls, have done more. On Friday, Fiorina made several stops in South Carolina, where she currently ranks third in the RCP average. Last week, she also campaigned in the Sunshine State. “You know in your heart of hearts that you cannot wait to see me debate Hillary Clinton,” she told a group there, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Indeed, Fiorina has positioned herself as the person in the GOP race best positioned and most unafraid to take on Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. But she has several other rivals to overcome first. And as the race wears on, Fiorina’s path has become murky. On the one hand, she is technically a political outsider in an environment that favors such candidates. But her credentials in that regard aren’t quite pure. Unlike Trump and Carson, Fiorina has run for public office before — a U.S. Senate race in California in 2010, when she lost by a wide margin in a favorable year for Republicans. And her pedigree, resume, and beliefs are more aligned with the so-called establishment part of the party. In many ways, this crossover is what makes her so appealing. She’s not a politician, and often laments the failings of the political class, but she is also acceptable to the party faithful, or those who may also be inclined to back someone such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio, notes Nate Cohn of the New York Times’ “Upshot.” But that dynamic also puts her in a tough spot. On the outsider side, Trump and Carson have big leads. And on the establishment-aligned side, Rubio, who has the political experience, is ascending, especially as Bush’s numbers fall. “It’s not clear there is room for a new comer like Fiorina in the ranks of Bush and Rubio, if that’s her ultimate aim,” says Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “She is quite capable of delivering a consistent, high-level performance that might inch her forward, but without the experience, it’s hard to see her lasting in the long run.” Also working against her is the way in which Trump and Carson are able to garner media attention. Even though Fiorina was considered the winner of the last debate, Trump managed to stay in the spotlight and remain relevant, even if it was by making outlandish or incendiary comments that earned him attention, like the fight he picked with Jeb Bush over his brother’s 9/11 legacy. Carson also managed to suck up the oxygen for a while with controversial remarks about Muslims and his response to the mass shooting in Oregon. (A Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers -- the second survey last week to show the retired neurosurgeon significantly leading Trump in the Hawkeye State -- found most respondents unfazed by, or even in agreement with, Carson’s remarks.) “There’s no question Fiorina needs to take better advantage of her outstanding debate performances and her outstanding interview skills,” says Cheri Jacobus, a GOP strategist. Fiorina earned plenty of media attention after the Simi Valley debate, but it was centered on a controversy that ultimately had a negative impact. Her business record at HP has come under higher scrutiny since then, namely the 30,000 jobs lost during a merger she orchestrated and her subsequent ouster, which included a handsome severance package. The attention also focused on the Planned Parenthood videos Fiorina referenced during her most emotional moment in the debate, a description that turned out to be inaccurate. Apparently to counter this, a campaign event in the days after the debate included a trip to a pregnancy center to watch a sonogram being performed. While the controversy surrounding Fiorina and the Planned Parenthood videos isn’t likely to turn off GOP voters, the scrutiny surrounding her business record has the potential to, especially as other rivals, Trump in particular, pile on. “She had two weeks of tough coverage basically saying she wasn't competent at the thing that's her number one credential,” notes Lynn Vavreck, a political science professor at UCLA whose book on the 2012 election, “The Gamble,” details the impact of media coverage on campaigns. “She’s got this moment where she is glowing [after the debate] and she needed to be able to seize on that, use the moment to trot out the campaign plan and strategy, what her message is, and how you differentiate from the others,” Vavreck says. “It’s a huge missed opportunity. … She needs to create something.” Fiorina had a remarkable fundraising quarter, bringing in $7 million — $1 million more than Rubio and a substantial increased from the $1.7 million she raised in the previous period. She had $5.5 million in cash on hand as of Sept. 30. Her campaign runs a very lean operation with few paid staffers. Spokeswoman Anna Epstein would not comment about whether the campaign planned to add more staff, but said the campaign does not have plans to run ads on the air anytime soon. “Carly has spent the last month talking with voters, especially in NH, IA, and SC. We are very pleased with where the campaign is and we look forward to the opportunity for Carly to introduce herself to even more voters at next week's debate,” Epstein said in an email. A super PAC, Carly for America, is focused specifically on the ground operation in the early states, which has tested the limits of coordination between the PAC and the campaign. (Carly for America isn’t planning on airing ads either.) Craig Robinson, an Iowa Republican strategist, says that Fiorina has been generating large crowds during her recent events in the state and that people are interested in her candidacy, but that her downward poll numbers show she hasn’t yet turned good debate performances into substantial ground efforts. “She raised good money with all that attention, which is important, but ultimately attention and money have to turn into actual votes,” Robinson said. “I think not having a robust campaign operation in Iowa and instead relying on her super PAC to do that work may have hurt her.” Wednesday’s debate, hosted by CNBC, will focus on the economy, which could give Fiorina a chance to tout her business credentials, but could also again raise the specter of her mixed record. “She needs to be focused, credible, and articulate and clear on her positions,” says Jacobus. “And I think she should ignore Trump.” Indeed, Trump’s controversial comments about her “face” gave Fiorina an opportunity at the last debate to take him on directly. This time, however, some strategists say, she needs to focus on herself. “She has all the right tools, she has worked very hard, clearly, to learn and to sharpen her skills, and she has got the knowledge base and the right instincts,” says Penny Young Nance, the president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. “I expect she will shine and get another bump,” Nance says. “The question is whether or not those bumps at some point will catch fire.” Caitlin Huey-Burns is a national political reporter for RealClearPolitics.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/u5nlXYlajT8/,"Left-of-center media outlets began attacking the local sheriff from the Oregon county where the recent mass shooting occurred almost immediately after the tragedy. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence jumped in, and now the full weight of CNN has joined the dog-pile attack. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin was first attacked for his pro-Second Amendment views, then the Brady campaign and CNN began attacking him for a Facebook post he allegedly made nearly three years ago. Yes, that means they targeted the sheriff and did opposition research on a leader currently handling a mass shooting in his county. First, CNN did a segment attacking the sheriff and giving attention to the pro-gun control Brady Campaign’s effort to attack the sheriff in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. That segment was followed up by CNN’s Jake Tapper. In general, Tapper has been widely heralded as fair and reasonable–and rightfully so–for his work. He was the moderator during a recent Republican presidential debate who fairly pointed out that no other country in the world has birthright citizenship before he asked a question about birthright citizenship. Nearly no other journalist working for a left-of-center outlet would have so fairly set up the question. Unfortunately, the past couple of weeks has seen Tapper begin to venture into advocacy journalism; he made sure viewers noticed his anger and outrage at comments made by Republican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson as he castigated him for saying that he wouldn’t want a Muslim as president. He then engaged in the attack on Sheriff Hanlin–again making sure that viewers could determine his own perspective on the matter. It is interesting to note that Tapper’s showing emotion for left-of-center causes began immediately after his remarkably fair handling of the Republican debate–a fairness he likely took immense heat over. The details of the Tapper segment that stood out as being the most unfair pertain to a subtle shift in assertions of fact, allowing an assertion that support of the Second Amendment was “extremist” to go unchallenged, and the fact that the sheriff is being researched and targeted in the first place to go unchallenged. Tapper began by questioning whether the sheriff made a controversial post, but then the segment began to assert that the sheriff had made the post as though it was a fact. In my experience, most sheriff’s allow staff to run their social media–making it likely the sheriff was telling the truth when he said to CNN that he didn’t post it. In addition to this, Tapper allowed a representative from the Brady campaign to assert that the sheriff held “extremist” views for supporting the Second Amendment. Tapper did not challenge the guest on that assertion. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the segment that makes it an “attack” is in the fact that Sheriff Hanlin’s personal views and support for the Second Amendment are being discussed at all. What did these views have to do with the fact that a Christian-hating mass murderer decided to kill 9 people in Douglas County? What justified deep opposition research of a sheriff who is currently handling a recent mass shooting in his community? Readers can watch CNN’s Tapper coverage of Sheriff Hanlin below.

https://patriotpost.us/posts/38022,"There was one particularly important line in his anti-gun screed Thursday. There was one particularly important line in Barack Obama’s anti-gun screed Thursday: “We know other countries in response to one mass shooting have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours, Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. As National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke notes, ""This is remarkable. Customarily, Democratic politicians react to mass shootings by calling for pointless around-the-edges reforms: ‘universal’ background checks, hard limits on the size of commercially available magazines, rules that determine how certain rifles may look, etc. Since 2012, in fact, Obama has tended to take this approach himself. Now, however, the president is openly praising two countries that confiscated — yes, confiscated — firearms. That matters — and a great deal. Why? Well, because the president’s defenders like to mock those among his critics who argue that he wants to ‘take their guns away.’ As of today, they will no longer be able to do so.” That isn’t to say they won’t try, but Obama’s comments were definitely revealing.

https://www.factcheck.org/2015/10/the-oregon-shooting-and-gun-free-zones/,"By Eugene Kiely Posted on October 20, 2015 In the wake of the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates claimed that the school was a “gun-free zone.” That’s not exactly accurate. Umpqua Community College does have policies prohibiting guns on campus, but they “would not apply to those with valid concealed weapon permits pursuant to Oregon law,” a college official told us. The Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, left 10 people dead, including the shooter. Trump, the Republican party’s leading candidate for president, was one of several GOP candidates who criticized the school’s policies on guns. He did so, for example, during an interview on “Fox and Friends Weekend” ( at the 2:25-minute mark). Trump, Oct. 4: You know that was a gun-free zone in Oregon where they had no guns allowed, no nothing. So the only one that had the gun was the bad guy, and everybody was sitting there and there was nothing they could do. Not a thing they could do. Mike Huckabee also used the “sitting duck” analogy in a tweet posted to his Twitter account a day after the shooting with the hashtag #UCCshooting. Carly Fiorina at an Oct. 2 press conference said about UCC: “This campus was a gun-free zone.” The confusion is understandable. The school has two policies that prohibit weapons on campus under certain conditions. The school’s student conduct policy states that students cannot carry a weapon “without written authorization.” “Possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms, explosives, dangerous chemicals, substances, or any other weapons or destructive devices that are designed to or readily capable of causing physical injury, on College premises, at College-sponsored or supervised functions or at functions sponsored or participated in by the College” is prohibited, the student conduct policy states. There is also a general prohibition on bringing weapons on campus “except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations.” “Possession, use, or threatened use of firearms (including but not limited to BB guns, air guns, water pistols, and paint guns) ammunition, explosives, dangerous chemicals, or any other objects as weapons on college property, except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations, is prohibited,” the school says on a web page labeled “safety & security info.” The state, however, has a 1989 concealed weapon law that conflicts with such gun bans. State law expressly states (in section 166.170) that the authority to regulate the possession of guns or “or any element relating to firearms” is “vested solely in the Legislative Assembly.” As often happens in these cases, the conflict was settled in court. A Western Oregon University student in 2009 challenged his school’s gun ban after he was suspended for possessing a weapon on campus despite having a permit to carry a concealed weapon. “A three-judge panel of the Oregon Court of Appeals said that an Oregon University System ban on guns exceeds its authority and is invalid,” the Oregonian reported. But here’s where it gets tricky: the state Board of Higher Education adopted a policy after the 2011 court case that was specifically designed to get around the court ruling. The Oregonian reported at the time that the new board policy prohibited students or anyone else doing business with the university or attending school events to bring guns into “classrooms, buildings, dormitories and sporting and entertainment events.” The Oregonian explained the board’s legal defense for the new policy this way: The Oregonian, March 2, 2012: The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in September that the board did not have authority to regulate guns through the use of an administrative rule. But the court also said the board has broad control over its property. So the board turned to the policy to keep guns off its campuses. George P. Pernsteiner, who was chancellor of the university system and author of the weapons policy, told us in an email how the policy works. “Basically, by registering to be a student, by being an employee, or by using a ticket to an event, the person had to agree not to bring a weapon — even if they had a concealed weapons permit,” Pernsteiner wrote. “Buildings were posted as not permitting weapons as a condition of entry into the building.  But, as you note, a person with no relationship to the university but with a concealed weapons permit could have such a weapon while walking on and across campus grounds (university open spaces).” However, Pernsteiner also told us that the board’s policy “applied to the seven universities that were within the university system and did not apply to any of Oregon’s 17 community colleges,” including Umpqua Community College. So we asked UCC if it had adopted a policy similar to the one at the universities that are part of the Oregon University System. Understandably, school officials did not immediately respond to our questions. On Oct. 19, we received a response from Rebecca Redell, UCC’s vice president and chief financial officer, who said the school’s weapon policies do not apply to those who have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Redell, Oct. 19: The student misconduct policy regarding firearms does not apply to students with a valid concealed weapons permit. There is a general prohibition against the possession of weapons on campus that would apply to College patrons, but this, similarly would not apply to those with valid concealed weapon permits pursuant to Oregon law (ORS 166.170). So, Umpqua Community College isn’t exactly a “gun-free zone,” as described by some of the Republican presidential candidates. Q: How do people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 pose a risk to people who have been vaccinated? A: An unvaccinated person who is infected with COVID-19 poses a much greater risk to others who are also unvaccinated. But vaccines are not 100% effective, so there is a chance that an unvaccinated person could infect a vaccinated person — particularly the vulnerable, such as elderly and immunocompromised individuals."

http://nypost.com/2015/10/05/republicans-cuomo-is-using-oregon-tragedy-to-promote-his-own-agenda/,"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Republicans are accusing Gov. Cuomo of using the Oregon community-college massacre to boost his own national image and they’re saying if he’s serious about stopping gun crimes, he’ll seek tougher penalties here and not look to Washington. “Cuomo callously is using the tragedy in Oregon to promote his own national political ambitions, saying, ‘Look at me! Look at me! We ought to shut down the government to do a great gun law like I did in New York,’ ’’ charged state GOP Chairman Ed Cox. “If Cuomo wants to make this the issue of the 2016 presidential race, he should start by making increased penalties for crimes committed with guns an important issue in his State of the State Address,’’ Cox told The Post. Cuomo, long rumored to harbor presidential ambitions, suggested on Friday, in the wake of Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., that congressional Democrats “shut down the federal government or threaten to shut down the government if we don’t get real gun-control legislation.’’ Cuomo, whose anti-gun “SAFE Act’’ was rammed through the Legislature in January 2013 after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre also suggested that stricter gun control should be a central theme for Democrats in next year’s presidential campaign. “When there are issues of war and peace out there in the world and we have an economy that’s not really working, to make this THE issue of 2016, as he’s trying to do, means it’s all about his ambitions,’’ insisted Cox. Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove, a potential GOP candidate for state attorney general, contended that if Cuomo were serious about a crackdown, he would propose that the Legislature sharply stiffen penalties for the criminal use of firearms. Abelove advocated a “substantial increase’’ in mandatory sentences for the criminal use of a weapon, doubling to 15 years the minimum sentence for the use of a loaded handgun in a crime by someone with a prior violent-felony conviction. “This is going to be a test of seriousness for Gov. Cuomo when he delivers his State of the State Address in January,’’ Abelove told The Post. Abelove’s comments came just days after he publicly chastised acting Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas, a Democrat, for barring her assistant district attorneys from obtaining handgun permits. Abelove said that not only would he encourage his ADAs to “exercise their Second Amendment rights’’ by obtaining permits, he would use his office funds from nontaxpayer sources, such as asset seizures, to pay the costs. Senate Democrats are fearful that Cuomo is reneging on his pledge to help elect his handpicked candidate to the seat of former Sen. Tom Libous of Binghamton. Cuomo’s choice in the November special election is Barbara Fiala, his former motor-vehicles commissioner, and his summertime pledge to support her was supposed to signal a change-of-heart for a governor who has been accused by Democrats of favoring continued GOP control of the Senate. But Cuomo has done nothing to raise significant cash or mobilize Democrats and independents on Fiala’ s behalf, Democratic insiders say. Share Selection"

Speaking to the New York Times, the Republican presidential candidate’s business manager, Armstrong Williams, said Carson used to heed the advice of advisers who told him to tone down his statements. But he has now decided to double down on recent controversial comments that advisers feared “could be a game changer for him, and not in a good way.” “He would listen to others and abandon sometimes what he feels deep down. But for the last two weeks he has said, ‘No,'” Williams explained.

Carson is six points behind GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in a new CBS News poll and seven points ahead of Trump in an IPP/TIPP poll. “He has not backed down from that moment,” Williams concluded. Carson’s latest controversial comments suggested that if more Jews were armed during the Holocaust, there wouldn’t have been mass genocide.

https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/10/11/scotus-watch-assault-weapons-bans-n2064390,"Jazz Shaw, our friend over at our sister site Hot Air,  wrote about a looming decision about Second Amendment rights from the Supreme Court that could come as early as this Tuesday. It deals with the Chicago-area city of Highland Park's ordinance that bans semi-automatic rifles that carry more than 10 rounds (via LA Times):   But if the justices vote to take up the case, it would put in doubt the constitutionality of laws in other places, including California, that prohibit semiautomatic weapons. ""These are some of the most popular firearms commonly used by law-abiding citizens in America,"" said David H. Thompson, a lawyer for the Illinois gun owners who are challenging the assault weapons ban adopted in the North Shore Chicago suburb of Highland Park. They lost before a federal judge and in a decision from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Now they are asking the high court to hear their appeal. […] In upholding the Highland Park ordinance, the 7th Circuit cited the Supreme Court's statement that ""dangerous and unusual weapons"" may be restricted. ""Assault weapons with large-capacity magazines can fire more shots, faster, and thus can be more dangerous in aggregate,"" said Judge Frank Easterbrook in April for a 2-1 majority. ""Why else are they the weapons of choice in mass shootings? A ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines might not prevent shootings...but it may reduce the carnage if a mass shooting occurs."" In dissent, Judge Daniel Manion said some homeowners want to keep a semi-automatic weapon at home for self-defense. ""Ultimately, it is up to the lawful gun owner and not the government to decide these matters,"" he wrote. Well, for starters, members of the media need to learn the difference between semi-automatic and automatic weapons. Simply put, a semiautomatic (or self-reloading) weapons system fires one round per trigger pull. Automatic fires multiple rounds per trigger pull. In fact, it’ll keep firing as long as that trigger is pulled back. They’re legal to own, though you’ll need to go through the ATF regarding the permit process. There is no ban on semiautomatic weapons in the United States, as that which would mean a very extensive gun ban was passed in Congress without anyone knowing about it. California, and other blue states’ so-called assault weapons ban, prohibits the sale of semiautomatic AR-15-style rifles that hold more than 30 rounds. That’s not the same thing, as buying handguns, which are also semiautomatic, is still legal, though the process for that is highly cumbersome in these anti-gun states. Second, and more to the point, it’s dubious whether the Supreme Court will hear arguments for this case. The Court has refused to hear a string of pro-Second Amendment cases, mostly relating to the concealed carry processes in “may issue” states. In 2013, Wollard v. Gallagher was asking the Court to address “whether state officials violated the Second Amendment by requiring that individuals wishing to exercise their right to carry a handgun for self-defense first prove a “good and substantial reason” for doing so.” The Court refused. In 2014, the Court refused to hear a New Jersey-based Second Amendment case–Drake v. Jerejian–which also asked “(1) Whether the Second Amendment secures a right to carry handguns outside the home for self-defense; and (2) whether state officials violate the Second Amendment by requiring that individuals wishing to exercise their right to carry a handgun for self-defense first prove a ‘justifiable need’ for doing so.” The Drake case is especially tough to tolerate since it could have cleared a path to 50-state concealed carry rights given the first question. I’m sure it will be addressed in time. These cases spoke much more to the Second Amendment, and could have had a huge impact regarding expanding those rights, but the Court decided to take a pass…twice. The case we’re dealing with here is a city ordinance in one of the most anti-gun urban areas in the country. Don’t be shocked if they take a pass on this one too. At the same time, Jazz noted something in his post that yet again places the anti-gun wing of America in a bind. “Are you hoping for a ban on “high-powered weapons” or are you looking to get rid of automatic weapons?” Jazz asks. He aptly notes that hunting rifles are by far much more powerful than a AR-15 concerning the type of ammunition each weapon system carries, so a so-called “high-powered” weapons ban would undercut what gun control activists have been saying for years; that they support the rights of hunters but want to keep the more scary, yet less powerful, weapons out of civilian hands. They lost that battle too. Regarding automatic weapons, they’re already regulated by the ATF, with a process that takes anywhere from eight months to a year, possibly more. If approved, that weapons system goes into a federal database, and every additional feature or improvement to that weapons must first be cleared by the ATF. Sounds like banning isn’t necessary in this front either. We should be taking a victory lap. Yes, public opinion can change, but it’s unlikely. We have won on every single front in this battle. We’ve won in Congress, the courts, the various legislatures, the ballot boxes, and the data and the polls show us–the pro-Second Amendment wing of America–stronger than ever. Then again, this seems to have been a double-edged sword, especially in the courts since a resemblance of a consensus has been formed on this issue. The courts aren’t really divided; even California’s Appeals Circuit struck down portions of the Golden State’s carry laws. The Supremes probably don’t see a need to move any faster on this issue. That doesn’t mean we stop fighting protecting our constitutional rights however.  Townhall.com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

At the top of the morning show, co-host Savannah Guthrie heralded: “People gets political. The glossy magazine known more for its celebrity scoops and red-carpet fashions wades into one of the most controversial issues in America. Is the magazine taking sides?” Later, while introducing a nearly three-minute segment on the topic, Guthrie declared: “The entertainment magazine has a call to action of sorts.” Correspondent Stephanie Gosk followed: “People magazine has a message for the people, rise up, reach out, and tell Congress to do something.”  A soundbite ran of People’s editor Jess Cagle proclaiming: “One thing is very, very clear, and that is as a country, we are not doing enough about gun violence.” Gosk touted: “People posted and published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the Senate and the House, along with this fact: Over 10,000 people have been killed this year alone by guns.” After noting how Cagle “was inspired by President Obama's speech following the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon,” she laughably asserted: “Cagle says this is not about an agenda.” Cagle professed: “I think that any time you try to start a conversation, some people take it as, ‘You want to take away my guns or you want to take away my liberties.’ I was very careful not to even take a side.” Moments later, Gosk added: “Cagle says he is tired of the rhetoric.” Cagle lectured: “Let's hold our representative's feet to the fire and let’s let them know that these kind of routine responses are just not going to cut it anymore.” Gosk mentioned “applause mixed with vows to cancel subscriptions” on social media in response to the magazine’s activism. She lamented: “Proof that when it comes to guns, everything is political.” She concluded: “Inaction on Capitol Hill after a mass shooting is what many have come to expect. People magazine's editor is hoping to move the needle, but will voter outcry be loud enough to overcome political reality?” Today devoted another two-minute segment to the story at the top of the 9 a.m. ET hour, with co-host Willie Geist telling viewers: People tackling the issue of gun violence this week. It pays tribute to the victims of last week's Roseburg, Oregon shooting, then calls on readers to do something about gun violence in America. The magazine has actually published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the House and Senate, urging readers to contact them, obviously to grab the reader’s attention....They’ve got a huge readership and they want to call – they say this is not a call to one side or the other of the issue, they just want people to start talking about it in a civil way. Here is a full transcript of Gosk’s October 8 report: 7:00 AM ET TEASE: SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: People gets political. The glossy magazine known more for its celebrity scoops and red-carpet fashions wades into one of the most controversial issues in America. Is the magazine taking sides? 7:31 AM ET SEGMENT: GUTHRIE: Let’s begin this half hour with the latest issue of People magazine. If you pick it up, you might notice a different headline on the cover. The entertainment magazine has a call to action of sorts. NBC’s Stephanie Gosk has more on that story this morning. Steph, good morning to you. [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: “People’s” Call to Action; Magazine Wades Into Gun Control Debate] STEPHANIE GOSK: Good morning, Savannah. Well, the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week has reignited the debate over one of the most contentious policy issues of our generation, gun violence. President Obama will travel there on Friday to visit with families of the victims. But the trip has angered locals, who say Obama is not welcome because he is using his visit to gain support for his gun control agenda. Now People has launched itself into the debate as well. People magazine has a message for the people, rise up, reach out, and tell Congress to do something. JESS CAGLE [EDITOR, PEOPLE MAGAZINE]: One thing is very, very clear, and that is as a country, we are not doing enough about gun violence. GOSK: People posted and published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the Senate and the House, along with this fact: Over 10,000 people have been killed this year alone by guns. Editor Jess Cagle says the idea was inspired by President Obama's speech following the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon. BARACK OBAMA: Somehow, this has become routine. CAGLE: I was watching President Obama give his speech, and when he got up to speak, I rolled my eyes and I thought, “Oh, here he is again. There has been nothing done about the last mass shooting.” GOSK: Cagle says this is not about an agenda. CAGLE: I think that any time you try to start a conversation, some people take it as, “You want to take away my guns or you want to take away my liberties.” I was very careful not to even take a side. GOSK: The sides are already well staked out, echoed over and over on the campaign trail this week. HILLARY CLINTON: The idea that you need more guns to stop people who are committing mass shootings is not only illogical but offensive. JEB BUSH [CBS EVENING NEWS]: Name a case where gun rights being restricted out of Washington would have changed the course of any of those cases. GOSK: Cagle says he is tired of the rhetoric. CAGLE: Let's hold our representative's feet to the fire and let’s let them know that these kind of routine responses are just not going to cut it anymore. GOSK: But like it or not, People's call to action has thrown the magazine into the political fray. On social media, there was applause mixed with vows to cancel subscriptions. Proof that when it comes to guns, everything is political. Inaction on Capitol Hill after a mass shooting is what many have come to expect. People magazine's editor is hoping to move the needle, but will voter outcry be loud enough to overcome political reality? Savannah? GUTHRIE: Interesting story, Steph. Thank you very much.

https://www.bustle.com/articles/115636-why-are-gun-sales-rising-theres-a-significant-pattern-for-when-people-buy-more-firearms,"News  It seems like a paradox at first glance: When people die from guns in this country, more people go out to buy guns. Data repeatedly shows gun sales have risen after every mass shooting in recent years. Gun purchasers spent $4.1 billion in 2014 and sales are expected to rise to over $5 billion by 2020, according to CNBC. CNN reports gun stocks are up as much as 70 and 80 percent in 2015 for major companies Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. This is nothing new. Sales for major gun companies rose to record numbers after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012 and after the protests at Ferguson, Missouri. Why is this happening? In a sentence, it is because the right to own guns under the Second Amendment has become a highly political issue. After shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Tuscon, pro-gun control politicians made calls for tighter restrictions on civilian gun purchases. In reaction, hoards of people bought guns because they feared these possible legislative restrictions. The New York Times reported that after Obama announced his visit to Roseburg, Oregon, to meet with the families of the victims of this latest tragedy at Umpqua Community College, some local residents were less than thrilled. Some accused the president of capitalizing on their grief to push his own gun-control agenda. As David Jaques, publisher of a conservative newspaper in Roseburg, told Bill O'Reilly, ""Our Douglas County commissioners, along with our Douglas County-elected sheriff, who is very popular, and our chief of police all came to a consensus language about him not being welcome here for political grandstanding."" This is consistent with the way mass shootings have been politicized in this country. Despite evidence that legal gun purchases caused more mass shootings than illegal ones, the gun lobby prevents any real progress, such as restricting the sale of highly dangerous automatic weapons, by sponsoring Congress members who support their interests. Gun owners have lived in fear of Obama ""taking away their guns"" for years, and so far they have not lost them. Gun sales rose when President Obama was first elected in 2008, especially when the NRA warned gun lovers that his election would result in a sweeping ban on guns. During the 2008 election, the organization circulated fliers that misleadingly alerted readers to ""Barack Obama's 10-Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment."" Repeatedly, the president has clarified his fairly moderate position on gun ownership. He wants to restrict access to assault weapons, which he has said exist only ""to kill people."" Given the NRA's infamously powerful lobby in Washington, D.C., it is likely that the debate over guns will continue to be a major political issue as the 2016 election season approaches. Hillary Clinton has vowed to tighten civilian access to guns through executive order if necessary. In Florida on Friday, Clinton asked ""What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers?"" Directly after her statement, guns shares rose slightly over the weekend, as CBS News shows. When anti-gun politicians publicly decry the existing accessibility of guns, sales rise. It seems almost a lose-lose situation: Politicians can't talk about passing gun control laws without accidentally encouraging people to buy guns. Will we ever be released from this vicious cycle? Time will tell. But a largely pro-gun Congress does not seem to be interested in restricting access to guns to save lives. Despite the fears of gun lovers, the Second Amendment will not be reversed any time soon. And every time it is challenged, people flock to buy guns. It just might take a drastic action like Clinton's proposed executive order to prevent another tragedy like last week's in Oregon. Choose an edition:"

(Photo by Rick Diamond/Getty Images for Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum) Rick Diamond/Getty Images  On Friday, October 2nd, just one day after a gunman on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people and injured several others, singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash took to her Facebook page, calling on readers to sign a petition urging the White House to reinstate the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons. That call to action touched off widespread debate from the singer-songwriter’s Facebook followers, with Cash writing an additional post calling for commenters to be more respectful of other’s opinions. The first of Cash’s writings came just hours after the massacre, which was reportedly the 264th mass shooting of the year (on the 274th day of 2015). In her original post, Cash wrote, “If you are as sick of gun violence in this country as I am, then let’s stop talking about it and just do ONE simple thing.” Related

						Elvis Presley: His 10 Best Country Songs Cash explained that the petition was created by her daughter, Chelsea Crowell (a contributor for Rolling Stone Country), and would require 100,000 signatures for it to be reviewed. As of Tuesday afternoon, the petition has nearly 3,600 signatures. That initial post from Cash received thousands of “likes” and was quickly shared by Facebook users — it also spawned hundreds of comments representing all sides of the thorny issue. The following day, Cash posted a link to a New York Times essay on gun control, which was accompanied by her own comment that read, “I feel as strongly and as passionately about this issue as all of you, but I won’t stoop to insults. Please, do unfollow or unlike if you can’t maintain basic courtesy.”  By Sunday morning, Cash had clearly had enough of the negative comments, posting another link to an essay on the issue and telling fans and followers, “This is my page and I do have a right to my beliefs and convictions, as all of you do. I was raised to have the courage to stand behind those convictions and it’s too late in life for me to sacrifice my integrity by keeping the most passionate of them secret. Those who tell me to ‘stay out of politics and stick to music,’ or, in other words ‘keep your mouth shut,’ are perhaps so obsessed with the Second Amendment that they haven’t noticed the First.” The singer and activist, who for a decade served on the board of PAX, an organization dedicated to preventing gun violence among children, added, “I have as much concern for the safety of my children as any mother alive and if that makes me ‘political,’ so be it. I don’t hurl insults because I think some of you have a bewildering attachment to military-grade weapons and a refusal to consider mandatory background checks. I’d appreciate the same civility.” While serving as a representative of PAX, Cash attended the 2000 Million Moms March on Washington, D.C., penning an essay in Rolling Stone about that experience. “At the end of the day, my friend Patty Smyth, who marched alongside me with Bette Midler, Emmylou Harris, Raffi and many, many more, said, ‘If nothing else, we helped carry the burden of the grieving mothers for one day,'” she wrote in the Facebook post. “I was full of expectation that our elected officials would rise to the occasion and enact basic gun safety legislation like background checks, safety locks and a ban on military-grade weapons. It turned out that, in fact, all we did was help carry the burden for a day. Nothing changed.”  Explaining that she eventually left the PAX board (which has since merged with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence) after “ten years of meeting grief-stricken parents of children killed by guns,” the mother of four also revealed that her daughter Chelsea had once been held up at gunpoint while working in a jewelry store. Cash closed the lengthy post writing, “If one classroom of first graders can be saved just by requiring background checks and a ban on military style weapons, wouldn’t it be worth it? One teenager in a movie theater, one student nurse, one pastor in the pulpit, one little pre-schooler? If the answer is no, or the answer is just more vicious rhetoric, then we should be ashamed. That child could be yours. It was almost mine. So don’t tell me to keep my mouth shut.” In This Article:

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/christie_blasts_nj_democrats_for_gun_veto_override.html,"TRENTON -- In the wake of last week's deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Gov. Chris Christie repeated a call Sunday that he's made after similar incidents: Rather than passing stricter gun control laws, the U.S. needs to do ""some tough things on mental health."" But this time, the Republican presidential candidate also admonished the Democrats who control New Jersey's state Senate, criticizing them for recently trying to override his veto of a mental health-related gun bill instead of considering his suggestions to strengthen it. Christie made the comments on ABC's ""This Week"" four days after a shooter killed nine people and wounded nine others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday. The governor called the incident an ""an awful tragedy."" ""It's terrible,"" he said. Host George Stephanopoulos asked Christie if there's a correlation between the fact that New Jersey has the second-toughest gun control laws in the U.S. and one of the nation's lowest murder rates. A 2014 study by the Violence Policy Center that found New Jersey had the fifth-lowest gun death rate of any state. MORE: Trump says world was better off with Hussein and Gadhafi Christie said he doesn't think there's a connection and pivoted the conversation to mental illness. ""I'm very concerned about the mental health side of this,"" he said. ""And I put forward a proposal to the Legislature last year and then again just about seven or eight weeks ago in response to a bill they sent saying: Let's do some tough things on mental health. Let's make involuntary commitment of people who speak violently easier for doctors."" The bill Christie referenced drew controversy in the state Senate two weeks ago. In March, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the measure, which would require that police be alerted when people seeking a gun permit in New Jersey ask a judge to expunge their commitment to a psychiatric hospital from their record. No Republican members of the Senate voted against it. But Christie vetoed the bill and instead proposed a new standard for involuntary commitment of patients who are not necessarily deemed dangerous ""but whose mental illness, if untreated, could deteriorate to the point of harm."" Democratic leaders in the Senate tried to override Christie's veto on Sept. 24 -- but the attempt failed, with only two of the Republican senators who voted for the bill in March voting in favor of the override. Republicans said they sided against the override because they are working on an alternative reform package based on Christie's suggestions. A report by the FBI in 2014 found that even though homicides have fallen overall in the U.S., mass shootings have risen drastically over the last seven years. Stephanopoulos asked Christie on Sunday what is ""so unique about American culture and American psychology"" that contributes to that rise. The governor repeated his message about mental illness. ""It's a really complex problem, but I think it's about the mental health issues, George, and I don't think we're as aggressive as we should be,"" Christie said. ""And that's why I put the proposals for New Jersey. ""And here's the bad thing about the politics of this,"" he continued. ""I've put this proposal forward twice and my legislature -- a Democratic legislature in New Jerse --  has ignored it. You know why? Because it doesn't create headlines. It's not taking away anybody's guns. It doesn't create a headline. So they don't want to deal with it. ""They tried to override a veto of -- of a bill that I put forward when my substitute bill was to get tougher on mental health,"" Christie added. ""Maybe this morning, the legislature in New Jersey will see what happened in Oregon and get tougher on the mental health issues to help these folks. We don't want to involuntarily commit them, to put them away. We want to protect others and get them the help they need."" Gov. Chris Christie appears in Camden recently. State Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) has said he will continue put the override up for a vote until it passes. In a statement to NJ Advance Media, Sweeney said that though ""we don't yet have all the information"" about the Oregon shootings or a ""full understanding of the shooter's profile, background or motives,"" the incident is ""another senseless act of violence."" He added that Democrats were determined to pass the bill to ""keep firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous people who try to get their mental health records expunged so they can purchase a gun."" ""The courts asked for this bill, the law enforcement community supports it and every Democrat and Republican who was present voted for it before it was vetoed,"" Sweeney said. ""It's a common-sense bill that would improve public safety. I will bring it up for another vote and give every legislator who reversed themselves another opportunity to do the right thing and vote for the override."" In a passionate speech at the White House hours after the shooting Thursday, President Obama called for tighter gun control legislation. ""I've had to make statements like this too many times,"" Obama said. ""Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times."" But many of the Republicans running for their party's 2016 presidential nomination said tougher laws are not the answer and that the focus should be on treating mental health. Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who is leading the GOP race in the polls, said during a rally in Franklin, Tenn., on Saturday criticized the ""gun-free zone"" at Oregon college where the shooting took place. ""If you had a couple of teachers with guns in that room you would have been a hell of a lot better off,"" said Trump, a former Atlantic City casino tycoon.

Chris Pietsch/ZUMA  People magazine, one of the country’s largest publications, with a circulation of more than 3.5 million readers, just threw its weight behind the push for increased gun control by publishing contacts for every member of Congress, and urging their readers to lobby for action. In an editorial on Wednesday, the magazine’s editorial director Jess Cagle explained the unprecedented decision to enter the gun debate after the latest mass shooting at a community college in Oregon. As President Obama said, our responses to these incidents—from politicians, from the media, from nearly everyone—have become “routine.” We all ask ourselves the same questions: How could it happen again? What are we doing about gun violence in America? There are no easy answers, of course. Some argue for stricter gun laws, others say we should focus on mental health issues, some point to a culture that celebrates violence. But this much we know: As a country we clearly aren’t doing enough, and our elected officials’ conversations about solutions usually end in political spin. In this issue we pay tribute to the nine Oregon victims, as well as 22 other men, women and children who’ve lost their lives in mass shootings—incidents where a murderer has opened fire on a crowd—in the U.S. during the past 12 months. The move by People is remarkable considering the magazine—a staple at every newsstand and doctor’s office in America—is traditionally associated with celebrity gossip and general human interest stories that carry little risk of being offensive or overtly political, meaning its message could reach many more Americans outside the DC echo chamber, in which action on gun violence has completely stalled.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/114798681/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Column-Shooting-coverage-is-routine-and-thats-the-story/,"Another day, another mass shooting. That’s become literally true; according to the Washington Post, the tragedy today in Roseburg, Ore., brings the total of mass shootings, in which four or more people are killed or injured, to 294. Thursday was the 274th day of the year. Whenever something like this happened, I used to drop what I was doing and monitor media coverage, looking for some kind of meaning. In retrospect, that probably wasn’t the best place to look. And not just because cable news goes into what-it-all-means mode, which quickly gives way to grandstanding and agenda pushing. No, ultimately it was a dead end because there is no meaning. You can’t be inside the head of every shooter. What’s more, you can’t rationally explain why we continue to allow this to happen. We can look to social media, which has supplanted traditional news coverage as the go-to way to experience big events, for clues. But like everything else about the coverage of these events, it’s become predictable, too. USA TODAY Up to 13 killed by shooter at Ore. community college First there is the report of what happened. Details are added as the story develops, some accurate, some not. Things sort out and then the fights begin. Gun-control opponents warn that it’s not a good time to debate laws, it’s too soon to talk about the politics of it all; let’s let the families mourn. That actually worked for a while, but soon gun-control advocates began saying that there is never a good time, so we might as well jump in now. This goes back and forth for a while, President Obama is mentioned — praised or vilified, again predictably depending on your political leanings — and … we move on. We move on. How strange is that? At one time, we might have said this was a coping mechanism. But that’s no longer true. Now it’s just routine. That sounds cold, heartless. But can you name the shooter in any of the more-recent tragedies? Or even where they took place? We aren’t numb to it, exactly. We’re numb to tragedies in the Middle East or Africa. In the United States, at least, we still bother to become outraged enough to tweet a thought or two before going back to whatever else is trending. STATESMAN JOURNAL Obama: 'Our thoughts and prayers are not enough' I’m not a social scientist, but I am an observer of human behavior and I would suggest that any possible scenario in which something like the shooting death of at least 10 people at a community college becomes routine means something is seriously wrong. How do we fix it? Stop making it so easy for disturbed people to get access to guns is a start. But it’s hardly the only solution. Something has to give. We can’t give up on outrage and heartbreak. Not as media, and not as a society. A story like today’s still has to shock us. It still has to move us. And it has to make us do something to stop this insanity. Events become newsworthy in part because they’re rare. They don’t happen every day. Mass shootings do. And that’s a story that has to change.

http://www.ibtimes.com/republicans-mass-shooting-response-focuses-not-gun-control-mental-health-reform-2125119,"Four years ago, when Adam Lanza opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 26 people, Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed calls for increased gun control, instead declaring a need for greater focus on the mentally ill. ""We should look for ways to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill prone to misusing them, but I oppose legislation that will be used as a vehicle to impose new Second Amendment restrictions on responsible, law-abiding gun owners,""  Rubio said in a statement a few months after the mass shooting. ""We should work to reduce tragic acts of violence by addressing violence at its source, including untreated mental illness, the lack of adequate information-sharing on mental health issues, and the breakdown of the family."" But in the years since, Rubio has not authored a single piece of legislation to expand services for mentally ill people while he has consistently voted against proposed gun restrictions. This lack of follow-through places Rubio in a crowded camp. In recent years, as mass shootings have become a familiar tragedy in American life, the reactions have generally adhered to a consistent script: Republicans coalesce around the position that guns are not to blame while urging that attention be paid to the dangers posed by failing to treat mental illness. Then they go back to what they were doing before, voting down gun control bills while offering little to follow-through on their calls for increased attention to mental health care.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's record is similar to Rubio's when it comes to gun rights and mental health legislation. The only time the two presidential hopefuls have come close to a bill addressing mentally ill people was when they joined a group of 24 cosponsors on an amendment introduced by Chuck Grassley to a gun control bill from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Neither the amendment nor the bill was successful. Other Republican presidential candidates have similarly offered little in the way of legislation that expands treatment for the mentally ill. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has also sponsored no legislation relating to mental illness, and former Governors Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee are both remembered more for laws protecting the Second Amendment than for mental health initiatives during their tenures. Even when Republicans have tried to take action on mental illness legislation, doctors and mental health experts often worry this can do as much harm as good. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been a vocal advocate of addressing gun violence through mental illness reforms. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 Christie vetoed proposed gun control legislation and instead suggested reforms to the state’s mental health treatment. His proposals have involved new standards for involuntarily committing patients who are not necessarily dangerous “but whose mental illness, if untreated, could deteriorate to the point of harm.” While some medical experts applaud lawmakers' greater attention to the mental health care system, others worry about potential misguided legislation in the wake of mass shootings. When New York passed a sweeping gun law in early 2013 that required mental health professionals to report patients who they thought were likely to seriously harm themselves or others, many experts objected. Paul Appelbaum, the director of the Division of Law, Ethics and Psychiatry at Columbia University, and Jeffrey Lieberman, former president of the American Psychiatric Association, wrote a piece in the New York Times in January 2013 arguing that targeting mentally ill people as a way to reduce violence “is a strategy fraught with risk.” “People troubled by suicidal or homicidal thoughts might avoid treatment, or be inhibited from speaking frankly about their impulses, if they knew they could be reported to state authorities,” they said. Evidence shows mentally ill people are not usually violent and are far more likely to harm themselves than other people. In fact, some studies have shown that less than 3 percent to 5 percent of U.S. crimes involve someone who struggles from a mental illness. That means the high-profile cases we hear about, including many recent ones where the shooter struggled with their mental health, are not the norm. But these men also shared another similarity: Many of them purchased their guns legally. The gunman who killed nine people Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Oregon  had 13 guns, all of which he or his family members had obtained legally. The gunman at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, this past summer also legally purchased his gun, as did the shooter at UC Santa Barbara in 2014, and the one in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2013. The man who killed nine worshipers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June should not have been able to purchase the gun but did because of a clerical error. U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (right) spoke at a news conference held by the groups Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Feb. 12, 2014.

Chris Murphy. Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst This pattern has generally not been called out by Republicans, who have instead focused on mental health as a cause. This stance reflects basic political realities in the U.S.: For many Republican voters, positions on issues surrounding gun rights serve as a litmus test. Almost all the 2016 Republican presidential candidates hold nearly identical views on the issue, consistently arguing against restrictions on gun ownership. Many of the leading candidates hold A-range grades from the National Rifle Association, which assesses politicians based on how they vote on gun legislation. Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee all hold A+ ratings from the nonprofit gun rights group, while Rubio, Paul and Sen. Lindsey Graham have received A grades and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina  has a qualified A (since she does not have a legislative record). The NRA has not graded Donald Trump or Ben Carson. Even the outsider candidates fall in line with the Republican positions on gun rights. After a man shot two journalists on live television in August, Trump said he was opposed to tightening gun laws. ""This isn't a gun problem; this is a mental problem,""  he said on CNN. Trump also released a  policy paper last month about protecting Second Amendment rights that included a call to address the country’s mental health system. Fiorina and Carson each criticized President Barack Obama’s emotional call to action after the Oregon shooting Thursday.  Carson said Thursday in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt that he worried about increased calls for gun control in the aftermath of the Oregon shooting. “Obviously there are going to be those calling for gun control, but that happens every time we have one of these incidents. Obviously that’s not the issue,"" Carson said. ""The issue is the mentality of these people. And we need to be looking at the mentality of these individuals and seeing if there are any early warning clues that we can gather that will help us as a society be able to identify these people ahead of time.” Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush spoke during the second official GOP debate of the 2016 campaign at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, Sept. 16, 2015. Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters These talking points espoused by the 2016 Republican field are often similar to those used by the NRA itself. The group, which has a strong political arm and lobbies aggressively, is known for supporting candidates through its political action committee, the National Rifle Association of America Political Victory Fund. Many of the GOP candidates have received donations from the group -- if not to their current campaigns then to past ones when they ran for the Senate or governorships. Cruz received $9,900 from the NRA during his 2012 Senate campaign and Rubio received $4,950 during his run for the Senate in 2010. Christie got a donation  from an NRA lobbyist in 2013 around the time he was also receiving criticism for “shallow” anti-gun-violence proposals after Sandy Hook. Bush, meanwhile, has several NRA employees and lobbyists among the donors to his presidential campaign and his super PAC, called Right to Rise. John Green, a lobbyist who has lobbied on behalf of the NRA, and his wife, each gave $2,700 to Bush’s campaign June 30. Joe Scofield, another lobbyist, gave $2,700 June 18, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Even when the NRA itself doesn’t give money to candidates, the group and its cause can wield significant influence simply through its domination of Republican views. Cruz’s main super PAC for his presidential run, for example, was jumpstarted by an $11 million donor named Robert Mercer, who is the CEO of Renaissance Technologies. Mercer is a member of the NRA and  has been described as a “hardliner on cultural issues.” Despite the relatively limited progress that has been made on federal legislation around mental health care and gun control in recent years, the latest mass shooting is  not likely to change much in either area. The media typically  loses interest in the gun control debate not long after each mass shooting, and with the 2016 election approaching quickly, neither Republicans nor Democrats will want to compromise too much and risk losing support from voters who have strong opinions about guns. Obama talked about needing a change during his speech after the Oregon shooting Thursday. “I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. And it can change.”"

        Ruby Cramer Posted on October 2, 2015, at 4:57 p.m. ET The day after the shooting that killed nine people at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, Hillary Clinton called for a ""national movement"" strong enough to rival the National Rife Association, which she described as ""an intense, dedicated group"" of gun lobbyists who ""scare politicians and say, 'We will vote against you.'"" Clinton, who has made new gun restrictions a regular feature of her speeches on the campaign trail, addressed the shooting at a rally in Florida on Friday. In other recent appearances, Clinton has advocated specifically for universal background checks on gun-buyers — an initiative that failed in Congress under President Obama. The deaths in Oregon on Thursday amounted to the 45th school shooting this year, according to the gun control group Everytown. At her campaign event in Florida, Clinton invoked past mass shootings, saying, ""People should not have to be afraid to got to college like this one, or go to the movie theater, or go to bible study."" ""What is wrong with us that we can’t stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers that they represent?"" she said to cheers from the crowd. ""Here's what the other side counts on,"" Clinton said. ""They count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, ‘We will vote against you.’"" Republicans, she told supporters, ""put the NRA ahead of American families."" Clinton promised that, if elected, she would ""never relent"" in trying to pass new gun measures. She acknowledged that passing new measures — which Obama was unable to do even in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School — would be what she called ""a political mountain to climb."" ""But you don’t get anything done in this country if you don’t start by calling it out,"" Clinton said. ""We need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listened to the gun lobbyists instead."" What Democrats need, she said, is a ""national movement"" to pass ""new, effective gun control measures,"" like her husband President Bill Clinton's in the '90s. ""There are a lot of ways for us to have constitutional, legal gun restrictions. My husband did. He passed the Brady bill, and he eliminated assault weapons for 10 years. So we’re gonna take them on. We took them on in the '90s. We’re gonna take them on again."" Contact Ruby Cramer at ruby.cramer@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) held a rally outside the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to support the oppressed Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang province. The group promoted the rally under the social media hashtag #CallItGenocide. Donald Trump needs allies in the House of Representatives, said former Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), commenting on congressional campaign. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) described September 11, 2001, as the “one of the most horrific terrorist attacks that we have lived through” in a video posted on the 19th anniversary of the attacks, over one year after describing 9/11 as a day “some people did something.” A new initiative promoted by nearly 150 left-wing organizations calls for a large scale boycott of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) — the historic U.S.-based NGO established to fight hatred, bigotry, and antisemitism and whose stated mission is to secure “justice and fair treatment to all.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) demanded that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) resign on Monday, after a controversy in which he was misquoted as saying slavery was a “necessary evil.” In fact, he said the Founders thought so. Lawyers representing Laura Loomer, a candidate for the Republican congressional primary in Florida’s 21st district have filed an appeal against a dismissal of a case against the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which alleges the Muslim advocacy organization’s pressure campaign caused the candidate’s permanent ban from Twitter. A federal judge, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, has blocked American communities and states from stopping refugee resettlement — a power that President Trump granted to them through an executive order last year. Islamic organizations say they are “thrilled” about nearly 40 state governors, including 17 Republicans, approving more refugee resettlement for their states thus far. A Minnesota Muslim woman who was forced to strip and remove her hijab while being arrested for a traffic violation in 2013 received a $120,000 settlement. A Muslim woman in Denver says that she went to an NBA game to see her daughter sing the national anthem, but was told to that she would have to remove her hijab in order to watch the performance. Protesters gathered at the Capital to demand that the United States admit 95,000 refugees into the United States in Fiscal Year 2020. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) “demands” to be the “arbiter” who decides if a Center for Security Policy (CSP) official is allowed to continue to own a minor league baseball team in Connecticut, Frank Gaffney revealed this week. The owner of a Minor League baseball team in Connecticut took heat for refusing to meet with members of the Hamas-Linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). An event featuring conservative commentator Pamela Geller will proceed as scheduled, despite being blacklisted by the ticketing service Eventbrite over supposed violations of the platform’s “community guidelines.” The group had been using the platform as its main source for organizing ticketing for the event. Ticketing service Eventbrite has blacklisted an event featuring conservative commentator Pamela Geller over supposed violations of the platform’s “community guidelines.” The ticketing service then warned the group planning to host Geller that any further attempts to create an event listing featuring the conservative commentator and free speech activist could result in the group’s account being banned from the platform. Banana Republic is the latest major retailer to sell hijabs, the Islamic head covering for women. Although the company has been praised for its new products by CAIR, it also faces backlash from the Islamic community for showing models in hijabs dressed in short-sleeved t-shirts and other clothing not in line with Islamic dress codes. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) is a “terrorist supporter” and “terror sympathizer,” said former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Independent filmmaker Michael Hansen has a new documentary out, Killing Free Speech. It features an exclusive interview with an official at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), who struggles to answer questions about the status of women in Islam. Independent filmmaker Michael Hansen has a new documentary out titled Killing Free Speech. It features internal emails from a New Jersey school showing teachers pushing political propaganda in the wake of President Trump’s travel ban. The United States Army War College canceled an event featuring a speaker that has criticized Islam. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) spoke on Saturday at a Washington branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraiser in Seattle, Washington, where security was tight and protesters showed up in support of Omar and others came to condemn her antisemitic remarks. ACT for America founder and terrorism expert Brigitte Gabriel slammed Facebook for taking her words out of context and placing her on a list of potential “Hate Agents,” as Breitbart News exclusively reported Monday evening. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is demanding that Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti apologize for agreeing with the Trump administration’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem on a recent trip to Israel. A Georgia prison guard who recently converted to Islam alleges that the state Department of Corrections has barred her from wearing a hijab while on the job. Seattle School District Urges Teachers to Follow CAIR Guidelines on Blessing Muslim Students During Ramadan TEL AVIV – The executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Los Angeles compared “apartheid” Israel to Nazi Germany in a speech he gave to students at the University of California, Irvine on the eve of Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day last Wednesday. Jihad in Philadelphia — among children: “We will chop off their heads, and we will liberate the sorrowful and exalted Al-Aqsa Mosque … and we will subject them to eternal torture.” Conservative journalist Laura Loomer has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Twitter and CAIR over her 2018 blacklisting from the social network. Jim Riches, the father of an FDNY firefighter killed in the terror attack of September 11th, 2001, doubled down on his criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Tuesday, demanding the freshman congresswoman apologize to him for downplaying the tragedy, according to a report.  Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gavin-newsom-guns_us_561ff791e4b028dd7ea72cb2,"Deputy Managing Editor, Breaking News, HuffPost California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) proposed a ballot measure on Thursday that would bolster the state's gun laws and give California's voters a chance to do what the state legislature hasn't. Newsom's call comes two weeks after a gunman killed nine other people at a community college in Oregon, again prompting anger and frustration nationwide over the lack of action to prevent mass shootings. The proposed measure, written in conjunction with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, has five components: banning most possession of high-capacity magazines, mandating background checks on ammunition sales, requiring individuals to report lost or stolen firearms, ordering the state to share data with the federal government on who is prohibited from owning guns, and strengthening existing laws aimed at keeping guns out of the wrong hands. Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, unveiled his proposal at a press conference in San Francisco, near the site of the 1993 massacre at 101 California Street. That shooting, in which a gunman killed eight people and wounded six others at a law firm before killing himself, sparked a national conversation on gun control that eventually led to the passage of a federal assault weapons ban in 1994. (The law expired in 2004 and has not been renewed by Congress.) On Thursday, Newsom pointed to the number of mass shootings in recent years, lamenting that lawmakers have failed to take any meaningful action toward preventing such incidents. ""We have the ability to do something about it,"" he said. ""We have the capacity to turn things around."" Newsom noted that an advantage of passing firearms reforms via ballot measure is that it will bypass legislators who receive donations from the National Rifle Association. ""I'll say this to the NRA, with all due respect: You can intimidate politicians. We've seen that. You've been effective,"" Newsom said. ""But you can't intimidate the public. That's why we're bringing this directly to the public."" Watch Newsom's remarks:  Newsom's measure needs to collect 365,880 signatures to qualify for next year's ballot. That shouldn't be much of a challenge in California, where a 2013 Field Poll found that 61 percent of voters believe it's more important to impose greater restrictions on gun ownership than to protect the right to bear arms. That same poll also found 75 percent support requiring individuals to pass a background check to buy ammunition and 58 percent back banning high-capacity magazines. California already has some of the nation's toughest gun laws, including a 1999 ban on assault weapons. Additionally, cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sunnyvale have adopted gun control measures of their own. All of those proposals have been met with strong opposition from the NRA, which weighed in on Newsom's proposal on Twitter: CA gun laws are already strict, plus it’s a good bet this law would be as ineffective as it would be redundant http://t.co/XndZgCcPXu #2A As of last week, there have been more than 1,000 mass shooting incidents in the United States since January 2013. Meanwhile, Congress has failed to pass any meaningful legislation addressing the epidemic of gun violence.

By 10/05/2015 10:02 AM EDT Presented by With help from Sarah Karlin and Doug Palmer BREAKING THIS WEEKEND: TPP NEGOTIATORS SEAL A DEAL ON BIOLOGICS —Talks were still ongoing as PULSE was filed early this morning, but negotiators finally eked out a deal on biologics protection yesterday. Pro's Doug Palmer has the details: ""Countries would be required to provide at least five years of data protection for biologics under a compromise reached by the United States and Australia and then face a decision on two different systems of potentially providing additional protection."" Both the U.S. and Australia had been gridlocked over protections for the new class of drugs, and top negotiators finally worked out a compromise after two and a half days of meetings that finally culminated at 3 a.m. Sunday in Atlanta. The U.S. had initially hoped to win 12 years of market exclusivity for biologics, as exists under current law, but Australia and other countries worried about rising health care costs that could result from a delay in the introduction of copycat versions of biosimilars. TODAY: THE SUPREMES KICK OFF THE TERM — The Supreme Court is set to officially open its new term today, and the health set has its eyes on two cases with major implications for women's health policy. First on the list, as Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn previewed, is a case over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors. (More on that one here:
http://politi.co/1M38lMx.) The Court will also consider eight separate petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing birth control under the Affordable Care Act. POLITICO's Josh Gerstein has more on that, in a preview of the biggest cases the Court could take up this term: ""Prominent judges are effectively begging the Supreme Court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-Catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others."" The story:
http://politi.co/1M38Ciw THE BIG PICTURE: INSURERS ARE OUTRAGED — Insurers are still reeling from an Obama administration decision last week to pay them just a fraction of the $2.9 billion they were counting on from the risk corridors program. And it's not just number shock: ""The timing means insurers have no ability to change their rates for 2016 to make up for any funding shortfalls [ahead of the upcoming third enrollment season] - and that's going to be particularly hard on the Obamacare co-ops and other smaller state and regional insurers,"" Pro's Paul Demko reports. — Big plans might miss earnings projections thanks to the meager payouts, but it will be much harder for small, regional plans and co-ops — many of which are already struggling. Even plans who weren't planning to see all the money they expected overestimated what they'll actually be getting this year, Paul reports. The full story,

DRIVING THIS WEEK: WHO WILL LEAD THE HOUSE? — Washington is in for a whirlwind week as Republicans jostle to see who will replace House Speaker John Boehner. Leadership elections are currently set for Thursday — at least for now, after rumors swirled this weekend that House Speaker John Boehner might delay the vote for the No. 2 and No. 3 slots in his conference. Adding complication to an already complicated fight: Now Rep. Jason Chaffetz is preparing a campaign for House speaker. Chaffetz, of course, is currently leading the House Oversight Committee's investigation into Planned Parenthood. — And Chaffetz is not pulling punches. The races have gotten increasingly bitter, with former allies sniping at each other in public. Chaffetz, a former ally of favorite Kevin McCarthy, decried his leadership this weekend. “We need a speaker who speaks,” Chaffetz said. “We lose the communication war time and time again, and I think the conference wants a proactive communicator.” McCarthy is promising a more inclusive style, with fewer decisions concentrated at the leadership level. Majority Whip Steve Scalise and Tom Price are in a heated race for the No. 2 slot — and a more conservative member may yet get in to challenge both of them. The POLITICO story is
here. THIS WEEK: CLINTON HEADS TO IOWA TO TALK HEALTH CARE — Hillary's heading to Davenport, as well as Mount Vernon and Council Bluffs, on Tuesday and Wednesday to talk with Iowans about ""her plans to make health care more affordable, and answer questions on her proposals to create an economy where all Iowans can get ahead and stay ahead,"" per a press release. She's already laid out her plans to address prescription drug costs and out-of-pocket health spending, but her campaign has pledged additional ideas on delivery system reform, too. THE LATEST ON P'P: RICHARDS RESPONDS TO FIORINA: The Planned Parenthood president on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" attacked Carly Fiorina for her false description of what's on those Center for Medical Progress videos. ""It is extraordinary that someone running for President would lie in that way. This has been completely discredited by every reputable news source. And yet Carly Fiorina seems to continue to repeat the same lie."" — Richards also talks about her organization's support for Sen. Susan Collins, her decision not to relieve executive Deborah Nucatola of her duties following the first video's release, and the organization's efforts to reevaluate its donation practices surrounding fetal tissue.

http://nbcnews.to/1M3aacl — AND DAVID DALEIDEN'S SET TO TURN OVER THE TAPES: The anti-abortion activist told a California judge on Friday that he's going to turn over the tapes he has this Wednesday, unless the judge intervenes. Chairman Chaffetz subpoenaed the tapes as part of the House Oversight investigation into the Planned Parenthood sting videos, despite a District court ruling that barred Daleiden from releasing them. Chaffetz told Daleiden last week that Congress's subpoena power supersedes judicial orders and that giving the videos to his committee doesn't constitute ""public disclosure."" — Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are appealing to Speaker Boehner to end the ""political theater"" that the tapes have created. Eighteen members asked him in a letter, led by Sen. Patty Murray, to end the effort to create a special committee to investigate Planned Parenthood, especially after the House Oversight hearing last week that they saw as ""singularly political in nature."" That letter:

ARE FLORIDA'S INSURANCE PLANS CURTAILING ACCESS TO HEP C DRUGS? — An analysis of Florida's Silver 2015 qualified health plans reveals discriminatory plan designs that are keeping hepatitis B and C drugs out of reach by placing them on high cost tiers, The AIDS Institute announced today. ""The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to discriminate against beneficiaries based on their illness or perceived health care use through plan benefit design, but that is what these plans are doing,"" Deputy Executive Director Carl Schmid said in a statement. — One interesting caveat: the group says that the high patient cost sharing can't be attributed to new hepatitis C medications like Sovaldi, since the plans were designed before most of those drugs were approved. Three of 12 of the silver plans it analyzed do not cover any of the new curative hepatitis C drugs. Both the federal government and Florida have warned insurers that placing all or nearly all drugs to treat a certain condition on the highest cost tier will be considered discriminatory, the group notes, and we should know in a few weeks if they follow through and enforce these laws for 2016 plans.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/ljN4dZOW0vo/,"On Friday’s “NewsHour” on PBS, New York Times columnist David Brooks and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne reacted to this week’s mass shooting in Oregon and discussed any potential government policy that could prevent these types of incidents. While Dionne applauded Obama for his aggressive effort politicize the tragedy, Brooks cautioned viewers that given America’s history with guns, eradicating them won’t likely happen. “Oregon happens to be a place with pretty tight gun control legislation,” Brooks said. “The criminals — the people who are in criminal gangs do get the guns illegally, but there are so many guns in this country. We can’t — we’re not going to deport 12 million immigrants. We’re also not going to get rid of 250 million guns. There are just practical realities.” “One in three American households has a gun,” he added. “There is a history of 300 years going back. And that’s why it touches such a nerve. And so we just have a legacy of a lot of guns in this country and that’s been true because of the nature of the settlement of the country.” Partial transcript as follows: JUDY WOODRUFF: So here we are yet again, another mass shooting. They seem to be happening every few weeks. David, the president said yesterday at his news conference that he thinks the country’s grown numb, that these are happening so often. Is he right? DAVID BROOKS: I actually don’t think so. The reaction certainly among the people I have spoken to is one of impatience and growing frustration. And so I don’t think we have grown numb to them. I don’t think we have taken a practical and a pragmatic approach to trying to prevent them. Obviously, as we heard earlier, they’re phenomenally hard to prevent. I’m for gun control laws, as I have said so many times. We have gone through a ritual on this program. JUDY WOODRUFF: We have. DAVID BROOKS: And I don’t think they will do much good. They might do a little good, just because there are 250 million guns in this country. I think it’s just very hard to control the ones, but they might erect a barrier. There’s obviously problematics with getting a list of people who have had mental health issues to run against a registry. That’s obviously a problematic thing to do. I have emphasized the make-believe function, that the profile of these guys who do it is very similar, and it is in this case, alienated young guy with loneliness issues and self-worth issues. And if we looked around for young men like that in our society, maybe we could do something there. I guess I would invite people to de-ideologize it, if that’s a word and to think pragmatically about the many steps we could do to hopefully make some dent, but it’s going to be hard to make a dent in this, I think. JUDY WOODRUFF: It is hard, E.J., and yet, as the president said, something has to happen, something has to happen. What is the something to change? E.J. DIONNE: I must say, I loved seeing his anger about this, because I think he reflected the anger of a lot of people. And I actually liked it when he said this is something we should politicize, because the barriers to de-ideologizing it, as David said, are political barriers. And I was so struck by some of the responses of the Republican candidates to this. Ben Carson, you’re not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal — the normal law-abiding citizens. Well, all laws only work for normal law-abiding citizens. Only with guns do we hear these arguments. Same with Marco Rubio, gun crime is committed by criminals. Criminals ignore the law. Well, yes. But, again, that’s an argument against all law. We have to try some things. There are no free and democratic and wealthy countries in the world that have our rate of gun violence. You know, David is quite right that we have to worry about loners and alienated people. We have to do better on mental health. But we’re not the only country in the world with loners and alienated people. And I think we have to be willing to take some steps on guns. And I don’t know what’s going to shake us to get there, but I think the president is saying we can’t just sit here anymore. I think there is an anger that’s growing out there that may at some point get conservatives in particular, who ought to be in a different position than they are on this issue. JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, as we heard from the two guests we talked to a few minutes ago, it is hard. And yet maybe there is a way to identify some of these young men — most of them are young men — who are deeply troubled and try to prevent them from getting access to them. DAVID BROOKS: Maybe. And I think the way — if we’re going to have any political process, it’s not to have a big fight about guns, which we have had a million times, but it’s to come up with a comprehensive package of reforms that would include some gun control things, but also some mental health things and a range of other things that creative policy-makers could come up with, and to de-ideologize it. To have the same fight again, I don’t see the point in it. On gun control, as I say, I’m not against them. But most of the guns that these guys get, they get legally. Oregon happens to be a place… JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was the case this time. DAVID BROOKS: And Oregon happens to be a place with pretty tight gun control legislation. The criminals — the people who are in criminal gangs do get the guns illegally, but there are so many guns in this country. We can’t — we’re not going to deport 12 million immigrants. We’re also not going to get rid of 250 million guns. There are just practical realities. E.J. DIONNE: But there are practical approaches to that. Australia had a massive gun buy-back program, 700,000 guns, which would translate into about 40 million here, which is a start. We are so hemmed in on the gun issue that we right now can’t do a thing. I’m all for doing more on mental health. I don’t think there is a real problem with that. The problem, the ideological part, is on guns. DAVID BROOKS: Yes. We have our history. We saw the graphic earlier in the program. One in three American households has a gun. There is a history of 300 years going back. And that’s why it touches such a nerve. And so we just have a legacy of a lot of guns in this country and that’s been true because of the nature of the settlement of the country. JUDY WOODRUFF: If history repeats itself, we talk about it for a few days and then we move on to the next thing. DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/us/to-curb-gun-violence-hillary-clinton-has-a-plan-for-possible-executive-action.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Haberman On the heels of the nation’s latest mass shooting, Hillary Rodham Clinton will issue proposals on Monday to curb gun violence, including holding out the potential of using executive actions. Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, will announce the new proposals in separate town-hall-style events in New Hampshire, a state with a Democratic senator who has voted for some gun-control measures but where there is a thriving gun and hunting culture. The proposals will come just days after Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” to counter the National Rifle Association, after another mass shooting, this time at a college in Oregon, left nine people dead. Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a constant in her campaign speeches since the Charleston, S.C., shootings in which nine black congregants were killed. The proposal most likely to generate controversy is using executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole, if efforts to pass new measures in Congress do not succeed, according to a campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, who asked for anonymity to lay out the plans before the candidate does. Most of the ideas would face a steep battle with the Republican-led Congress, and efforts to pass new gun restrictions in the wake of the murders of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Since then, there have been a number of mass shootings, including the most recent, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., last week. But her proposals are in sharp contrast to the Republican presidential hopefuls, and she is making them as her main rival in the primary polls, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has gained ground against her, but has also come under scrutiny among Democrats for some gun control policies he has opposed in the past. A central issue in Mrs. Clinton’s proposals are the background checks on prospective gun buyers, which are required for retailers at stores. But under federal law, they are not required at gun shows or over the Internet with private sellers. Under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, she would use administrative powers to make anyone selling a substantial number of guns declared “in the business” of firearms dealing, and subject to the same rules as retailers, if Congress does not act, according to the campaign aide. It was not immediately clear what the bar for being declared “in the business” would be. And use of executive action in connection with guns is certain to face criticism from staunch supporters of the Second Amendment. It is also likely to be applauded by Democrats who have grown weary of gridlock in Congress. Earlier in the evening, another Democratic candidate, Martin O’Malley, urged Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to embrace policies he supports, including a reinstatement of the lapsed federal assault weapons ban. That does not appear to be among those she will suggest. Mrs. Clinton will suggest urging Congress to end another loophole, by which people with felony records who should be barred from obtaining a gun can get one if their background check is not completed within three days. That loophole was how Dylann Roof, the accused killer in Charleston, obtained his weapon despite a felony conviction for a drug arrest. Since the Charleston shooting, Mrs. Clinton has frequently talked about gun control, but her comments have grown stronger. On Friday, a day after the shootings in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” that would counter the National Rifle Association. “Here’s what the other side counts on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, ‘We will vote against you.’ ” Advertisement"

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/justices-mull-appeal-of-chicago-suburbs-assault-weapons-ban/,"Watch CBSN Live  October 17, 2015 / 10:41 AM
          / AP WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court has so far resisted elaborating on two landmark decisions that established a nationwide right to defend one's home with a gun. That could change with a new appeal filed by gun owners that challenges a Chicago suburb's assault weapons ban. The appeal by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that the City of Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition clips of more than 10 rounds. The justices put off consideration of the appeal last week. In recent years, the court has almost always deferred action on an appeal before agreeing to take it up. The court could say as early as Monday whether it will hear the case. Friedman is a practicing pediatrician and owner of semi-automatic weapons. He lost a bid for the state Senate as a Republican in 2012 in a campaign in which some conservatives complained about his support for abortion rights. In recent days, Friedman has used his Twitter account to offer tips for Israelis who want to arm themselves in public. He did not respond to messages left with his medical practice. The Supreme Court's 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller and the 2010 decision in McDonald v. Chicago focused mainly on the right to defend one's own home. Gun rights groups have failed repeatedly to get the justices to say how broadly the Second Amendment protects gun rights. The court has turned away challenges to gun laws at least three other times in cases that involved whether people have a right to be armed in public. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association. The city's assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision. ""If a ban on semi-automatic guns and large-capacity magazines reduces the perceived risk from a mass shooting and makes the public feel safer as a result, that's a substantial benefit,"" Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado. In dissent, Judge Daniel A. Manion said individuals, not elected officials, get to choose which guns they prefer for self-defense. ""To limit self-defense to only those methods acceptable to the government"" creates an ""enormous transfer of authority from the citizens of this country to the government - a result directly contrary to our Constitution and to our political tradition,"" Manion wrote. Twenty-four states and other gun-rights groups are supporting the appeal at the Supreme Court. The justices' refusal to say more about gun rights has allowed, even encouraged, federal judges to take a narrow view of the meaning of the Second Amendment, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on behalf of the states. ""It is time for this court to intervene."" The case is Friedman v. City of Highland Park, 15-133.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/preston-shipp/on-the-arming-of-serious-_b_8252454.html,"Preston is a former prosecutor who has been converted into an advocate for criminal justice reform. In response to latest mass shooting in Oregon on October 1, 2015, which left nine more innocent people dead, Tennessee Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey weighed in by encouraging Christians to take up arms: ""I would encourage my fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to think about getting a handgun carry permit . . . Our enemies are armed. We must do likewise."" Ramsey noted that the targets of these mass shootings are ""Christians and defenders of the West;"" hence the call to arms for followers of Jesus. Ramsey's counsel harmonizes well with what passes for conventional wisdom regarding violence, self-defense, and self-preservation, on both the personal and global levels. We have stand-your-ground laws in our local communities, and the U.S. seems to be perpetually at war with enemies that we perceive to be threats to freedom and democracy. Thus, there is clear precedent for Ramsey's advice to resort to violence when we feel threatened and afraid. The problem is that he issued this call directly to ""Christians who are serious about their faith,"" yet his suggested course of action does not conform to the teachings of Christ himself. Jesus gave some commands to his would-be followers that seem to contradict conventional wisdom regarding self-defense and responding to enemies. ""But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also."" (Matt. 5:39). He continues, ""You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven."" (Matt. 5:43-45). On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, Jesus admonished his disciple Peter against using his sword in self-defense. ""Put your sword back in its place,"" Jesus said to him, ""for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."" (Matt. 26:52). We can all acknowledge that these are difficult and demanding teachings. After all, when one does not resist an evil person, but instead turns the other cheek, it is possible that he will receive a second slap. And when a person loves her enemy, there is no guarantee that the enemy will return the good will. Jesus refused to defend himself or allow others to defend him with force, and we all know how that ended. The teachings may be even more challenging when we have become accustomed to keeping weapons for purposes of self-defense. We tend to put our trust in weapons and violence and derive from them a sense of safety and protection. Isn't this, after all, the gist of Ramsey's advice? Get a gun so that you are better able to protect yourself? Jesus' last point about people who use weapons being killed by weapons seems to expose the falseness of the sense of security we draw from an ability to do violence. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to let go of even a false sense of security, especially when we are afraid. It is tempting to quickly dismiss Jesus' teachings as spiritual rather than physical, to claim he was using hyperbole, or to insist that he did not really mean what he said about not resisting an evil person. We could disregard the teachings as unrealistic, ineffective, irresponsible, or even naive, and have no further consideration for them. Moreover, it's not hard to find other scriptures that support the use of violence in self-defense, so we could cling to those as we interpret Jesus' words as essentially irrelevant to how the world really works. The early church, however, at least for the first 300 years or so, seemed to agree that Jesus meant what he said and that violence was prohibited for his followers. Lactantius of Bithynia wrote, ""Thus it will be neither lawful for a just man to engage in warfare, since his warfare is justice itself, nor to accuse any one of a capital charge, because it makes no difference whether you put a man to death by word, or rather by the sword, since it is the act of putting to death itself which is prohibited. Therefore, with regard to this precept of God, there ought to be no exception at all; but that it is always unlawful to put to death a man, whom God willed to be a sacred animal."" Tertullian wrote, ""But how will a Christian war, nay, how will he serve even in peace without a sword, which the Lord has taken away? For albeit soldiers had come unto John, and had received the formula of their rule; albeit, likewise, a centurion had believed, still the Lord afterward, in disarming Peter, unbelted every soldier."" At the very least, church history, stained as it is by the blood of countless saints who chose faithfulness to these difficult teachings over protecting and preserving their own lives, compels us not to quickly assume that Jesus did not mean exactly what he said. A literal application of Jesus' teachings about violence is enough to make anyone uneasy, particularly when we are confronted by a new mass shooting every few days or weeks. It seems clear enough that Ramsey's remarks were prompted by fear. We see another shooting on the news and think, ""What if that happened to me? How can I protect myself and my family?"" At this point, however, other teachings of Jesus become less enigmatic and more comforting as we refuse to resist evil on its own terms. ""Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul . . . Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows."" (Matt. 10:28-30). Do not be afraid, Jesus says over and over again in all four gospels. Do not abandon the teachings out of fear for your own safety: ""For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."" (Matt. 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24). That is, even if our lives are taken from us, Jesus promises that the loss is but an illusion. Is this not what we proclaim every time we eat the bread and drink the cup? Incidentally, Jesus ties this teaching about not acting to save our own lives to faithfully following Jesus to the cross. (Matt. 16:24). It is easy enough for modern American Christians to spiritualize such teachings, forgetting the many Christians who have willingly suffered and died, many on crosses of their own, for their discipleship to Jesus. Self-preservation, it seems, is not a Christian virtue. Faithfulness is. In calling Christians to take up arms, Ramsey has failed to reckon with some of Jesus' most challenging instructions, commands that strike at the very heart of the gospel. He is encouraging Christians to place their trust in the wrong thing. I am reminded here of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who, when threatened with death, refused to submit to fear, instead placing their trust in God to deliver them. They acknowledged, however, that God might not deliver them, that He might allow them to suffer and be killed at the hands of wicked men. Even then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to allow their actions to be dictated by fear of death. Faithfulness to God was their guiding principle. It should be the same for Christians today. Contrary to the advice of Lt. Gov. Ramsey, Christians have no need of handgun carry permits. They have already died to themselves, and their lives are hidden with Christ in God. Whom shall they fear? Preston is a former prosecutor who has been converted into an advocate for criminal justice reform."

Friday, 02 October 2015 12:46 PM The gunman stormed into a classroom in Snyder Hall on campus, shot a professor at point-blank range, then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before he shot them one by one, according to survivors' accounts. Seven people were hospitalized, three of them listed as critical. The killer died after exchanging gunfire with two police officers who confronted him. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin vowed never to utter the shooter's name calling the killings 'a horrific act of cowardice.' In a photo posted on what was believed to be his MySpace profile, a young man with a shaved head and dark-rimmed eyeglasses stares into the camera while holding a rifle.

During the shooting, students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave. ""We  began to run,"" student Hannah Miles said. ""A lot of my classmates were  going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I  turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building."" At  least nine people were killed and seven others wounded Thursday, the  fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber  town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent  Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with  about 3,000 students. ""I suspect this is going to start a  discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare  themselves for events like this,"" former college president Joe Olson  said. Mercer lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester,  where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff  John Hanlin said Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would  be released later, he said. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The  Associated Press that Mercer ""seemed really unfriendly"" and would ""sit  by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer's mother also lived upstairs and was ""crying her eyes out"" Thursday. Social  profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA,  frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass  shootings. There didn't seem to be many recent connections on the  social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing  two friends. In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to  have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account  and a blog. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to  belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads  included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at  Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged  readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two  former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented  materialism as preventing spiritual development. A MySpace page  that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics  of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a  rifle. Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of  Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as  uncommunicative. His father, Ian Mercer, said late Thursday that  it's been a ""devastating day"" for him and his family, and he has been  talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV  and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana,  California. Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn't make sense. ""All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,"" she told KCBS-TV. Hanlin, the sheriff, said Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter's name because that's what he would have wanted. ""I  will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably  sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,"" said a visibly angry  Hanlin. Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" was played. Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities. ""That's all I could think about today. There's 10, 9 kids who won't get those doors opened,"" he said. Roseburg  is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the  Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it's no stranger  to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and  wounded a fellow student in 2006. At the White House, a visibly angry President Barack Obama challenged Americans across the political spectrum to press their elected leaders to enact tougher firearms-safety laws. He lashed out at the National Rifle Association gun lobby for blocking reforms and lamented how common mass shootings had become. ""Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine,"" he said. ""We've become numb to this."" Residents at an apartment house a short distance from campus where the suspect lived recognized him from photos and described him as edgy. A man identifying himself as Ian Mercer, the gunman's father, spoke briefly to a throng of reporters and camera crews outside his home in Los Angeles on Thursday night. ""It's been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,"" he said, according to a transcript provided by KNBC-TV. Authorities offered no motive for the shooting. Hanlin, the county sheriff, said an investigation was underway by homicide detectives and federal agents. Residents of Roseburg, about 260 miles (420 km) south of Portland, were left to ponder the how and why of the violence. ""ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?"" Accounts from survivors were chilling. Stacy Boylan  told CNN his daughter recalled seeing her professor being shot point blank as the assailant stormed into the classroom. ""He was able to stand there and start asking people one by one what their religion was,"" Boylan said, relating the ordeal as described by his daughter. ""'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them. ... 'If you're a Christian, stand up. Good. Because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second,' and he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line, doing this to people.""

Another family member,  Autumn Vican,  described to NBC News what her brother J.J. witnessed in the room where the shootings occurred. According to NBC: “Vicari said at one point the shooter told people to stand up before asking whether they were Christian or not. Vicari’s brother told her that anyone who responded ‘yes’ was shot in the head. If they said ‘other’ or didn’t answer, they were shot elsewhere in the body, usually the leg.” Scores of people huddled at a somber candlelight vigil in a park on Thursday night. ""We need to start loving each other as people ... or our nation is going to start falling apart,"" said Michael Sprague, 35, a businessman who lives in the Roseburg area. The violence in Roseburg was the latest in a flurry of mass killings in recent years across the United States and the deadliest so far in 2015. It surpassed the nine killed in a gun battle between motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the nine who died in the rampage at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June. Not counting Thursday's incident, 293 mass shootings have been reported this year, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The violence has fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and for better care for the mentally ill. Those grieving at Thursday night's vigil said they were still trying to understand the tragedy. ""You know, there's all this stuff in the news and with politics going on about the Second Amendment and gun control,"" said Ken Shemel. ""It's like, 'Come on, guys, just give us a second to breathe,' you know?""   © 2021 Thomson/Reuters.  All rights reserved. Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

At the debate were former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. The moderators were CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, political correspondent Dana Bash and CNN en Espanol anchor Juan Carlos Lopez. Here is a full transcript of what they said, courtesy of CNN. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: And good evening everyone. We are live at the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas for the CNN/Facebook Democratic Presidential Debate. Welcome. (APPLAUSE) The five major candidates are about to face off for the first time in a primary race that is a lot more competitive than many people had expected. Welcome. I’m Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We’re just seconds away from introducing the candidates to viewers in the United States and watching right now around the world. This debate is airing on CNN, CNN en Espanol, and CNN International. It’s also being broadcast on the Westwood One Radio Network. I’ll be the moderator tonight. I’ll also be joined in the questioning by my CNN colleagues, our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash; CNN en Espanol anchor Juan Carlos Lopez, and CNN anchor Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats nationwide. We’ve teamed up with Facebook to send a campaign camper around the country for the past three weeks. Thousands of people stepped inside to record their questions for the candidates on video. Millions more have weighed in on Facebook. Now it’s time to meet the candidates. Joining us on stage, please welcome former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee. (APPLAUSE) Former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley. (APPLAUSE) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE) And former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) Now, everybody, please rise for our national anthem, performed by nine-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, Sheryl Crow. (SINGING) (APPLAUSE) COOPER: I want to thank Sheryl Crow. The candidates are here. The crowd is certainly ready. The first Democratic debate will begin right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: There is certainly a lot of excitement in this room tonight, and no doubt around the country. We are back in the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas in the presidential battleground state of Nevada for the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign. I’m Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We’ve already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. As the moderator, I’ll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion. I’ll be joined in the questioning by CNN’s Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I’ll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism. Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves. Let’s begin with Governor Chafee. Governor? FORMER GOV. LINCOLN CHAFEE, D-R.I.: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate’s experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision. I’m the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years. As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we’re having this debate. I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I’ve always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I’ve shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards. As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars. I look forward to the discussion ahead. Thank you (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Thank you very much, Governor. (APPLAUSE) Senator Webb, you have two minutes. FORMER SEN. JIM WEBB, D-VA.: Thank you. You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. WEBB: They’re looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I’ve also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor. In government service, I’ve fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy — in the Reagan administration. In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam — learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor O’Malley, you have two minutes. FORMER GOV. MARTIN O’MALLEY, D-MD.: My name is Martin O’Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father. My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn’t do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals. Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country’s doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a — deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself. What I’m talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn’t money, it’s people. It’s all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor O’Malley, thank you very much. Senator Sanders. SEN. BERNARD SANDERS, I-VT.: Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent. As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people. Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe — just maybe — we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. (APPLAUSE) What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton? FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. I’m Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I’m the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time — my entire adult life — looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential. I’ve traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I’ve put forward specific plans about how we’re going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. At the center of my campaign is how we’re going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. And then we have to figure out how we’re going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we’re going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it’s about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. (APPLAUSE) During the course of the evening tonight, I’ll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I’ve done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides — the divides economically, because there’s too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community — so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Thank you, all. It is time to start the debate. Are you all ready? (APPLAUSE) All right. Let’s begin. We’re going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you. Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. You were against same-sex marriage. Now you’re for it. You defended President Obama’s immigration policies. Now you say they’re too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the “gold standard”. Now, suddenly, last week, you’re against it. Will you say anything to get elected? CLINTON: Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings — including those of us who run for office — I do absorb new information. I do look at what’s happening in the world. You know, taker the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, “this will help raise your wages.” And I concluded I could not. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency. Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you’d, quote, “take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values.” Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, “being kind of moderate and center.” Do you change your political identity based on who you’re talking to? CLINTON: No. I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don’t take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children’s Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we’re going to un-stack the deck, and how we’re going to make it possible for more people to have the experience I had. You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president. COOPER: Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate? CLINTON: I’m a progressive. But I’m a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know… (APPLAUSE) …how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I’ve had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from… COOPER: Secretary… CLINTON: …reforming foster care and adoption to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures… COOPER: …thank you… CLINTON: …8 million kids. So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values… COOPER: …Senator… CLINTON: …I’ve always had. COOPER: Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States? SANDERS: Well, we’re going to win because first, we’re going to explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent — almost — own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we’re not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have — we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Denmark is a country that has a population — Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here, and that’s what I’m trying to get at. You — the — the Republican attack ad against you in a general election — it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you’re not a capitalist. Doesn’t — doesn’t that ad write itself? SANDERS: Well, first of all, let’s look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November. Sixty-three percent of the American people didn’t vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn’t vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country. Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing. COOPER: You don’t consider yourself a capitalist, though? SANDERS: Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist? CLINTON: Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families. And I don’t think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have. But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it’s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn’t run amok and doesn’t cause the kind of inequities we’re seeing in our economic system. But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history… COOPER: Senator Sanders? CLINTON: … of the world. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that. Of course, we have to support small and medium-sized businesses. But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn’t mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake… COOPER: We’re going to get… SANDERS: … not just for billionaires. COOPER: We’re going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability. Governor Chafee, you’ve been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican. When you were elected governor, you were an independent. You’ve only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won’t change again? CHAFEE: Anderson, you’re looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it’s… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean, you’ve been a Republican, you’ve been an independent. CHAFEE: Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I’m a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues. And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it’s on the environment, a woman’s right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate. Time and time again, I have never changed. You’re looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed. COOPER: Then why change labels? CHAFEE: The party left me. There’s no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That’s what we were up against. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore’s mayor. As we all know, we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April. The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what’s going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years? O’MALLEY: Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there’s a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999… COOPER: She actually — just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance. I mean, there’s a number of old policies that we’re seeing the results of. That distress of communities, where communities don’t want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it’s a direct result of these failed policies. O’MALLEY: Well, let’s talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray’s tragic death. Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We’ve saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn’t easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office. COOPER: In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people. The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause. O’MALLEY: Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word “settle.” That’s true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together. COOPER: Thank you, Governor. O’MALLEY: Thank you. COOPER: Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action “state-sponsored racism.” In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren’t you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now? WEBB: No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I’ve decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That’s the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, “of color,” other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we’re not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have — by culture, by the way. COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much. Let’s move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We’re going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one. Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you’re reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not? SANDERS: Let’s begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let’s also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we’ve got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Also I believe, and I’ve fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can’t get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don’t have insurance or they’re too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately. COOPER: Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits? SANDERS: Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don’t. On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns? CLINTON: No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it’s time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country… (APPLAUSE) … supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do. Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn’t that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We’re not going to let it continue. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: We’re going to bring you all in on this. But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response. SANDERS: As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn’t convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston. How can you? O’MALLEY: And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it’s fine to talk about all of these things — and I’m glad we’re talking about these things — but I’ve actually done them. We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a — a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this — this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn’t even ask where it was going. And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It’s time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds. SANDERS: I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But here is the point, Governor. We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not. Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together. O’MALLEY: Senator — Senator, excuse me. (CROSSTALK) O’MALLEY: Senator, it is not about rural — Senator, it was not about rural and urban. SANDERS: It’s exactly about rural. O’MALLEY: Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas. SANDERS: Governor… O’MALLEY: And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA. SANDERS: Well, as somebody who has a D-minus voting record… (CROSSTALK) O’MALLEY: And I have an F from the NRA, Senator. SANDERS: I don’t think I am pandering. But you have not been in the United States Congress. O’MALLEY: Well, maybe that’s a healthy thing. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: And when you want to, check it out. And if you think — if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken. COOPER: Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint. Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA. You’ve said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns. Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting? WEBB: Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in ’07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information. So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence. COOPER: Senator… WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family. COOPER: Senator — Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said? CHAFEE: Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they’re coming to take away your guns. And, they’re successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we’ve got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we’ve go to change this. We’re not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let’s find common ground here. COOPER: I want to… O’MALLEY: …Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state — when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that’s why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn’t… SANDERS: …Excuse me… O’MALLEY: …dare to petition a referendum… SANDERS: …I want to make… O’MALLEY: …Because we built a public consensus… COOPER: …I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines. Secretary Clinton, Russia, they’re challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence, they’ve lied about who they’re bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria? CLINTON: Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan. There’s no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important — and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they’ve got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict. And, to — provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it’s important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it’s not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can’t do that if we don’t take more of a leadership position, which is what I’m advocating. COOPER: Senator Sanders, what would you do differently. SANDERS: Well, let’s understand that when we talk about Syria, you’re talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You’re talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS. You’re talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa. I’m the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria. COOPER: On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to… CLINTON: …Well, nobody does. Nobody does, Senator Sanders. COOPER: I want to go to Dana Bash. Dana? DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Governor Chafee, you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war. You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq. She has since said that her vote was a mistake. Why isn’t that good enough? CHAFEE: Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it’s the worst decision in American history. That’s very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders. So, as we look ahead, if you’re going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire — if you’re looking ahead, and you’re looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — I know because I did my homework, and, so, that’s an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that’s what’s important. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Secretary Clinton, he’s questioning your judgment. CLINTON: Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue. After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State. He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him… (APPLAUSE) …in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues. You know, I — I agree completely. We don’t want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition — in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department — to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region. Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. So I think while you’re talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran — I think I have a lot of evidence… (CROSSTALK) BASH: Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders, I want to bring you in here. My question for you is, as a congressman, you voted against the Iraq War. You voted against the Gulf War. You’re just talking about Syria, but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force? SANDERS: Let me just respond to something the secretary said. First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems. Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the — I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002. And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen. So I think… BASH: All right. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that’s the direction I believe we should have (inaudible). COOPER: But, Senator Sanders, you didn’t answer the question. Under what — under what circumstances would you actually use force? SANDERS: Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, “let’s stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,” I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan. When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action. (UNKNOWN): You’re at work with our allies. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: I’m gonna bring you all in on this. Governor — Governor O’Malley, Secretary Clinton… SANDERS: I don’t believe that any… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan. As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya. Is she too quick to use military force? O’MALLEY: Anderson, no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option. What disturbed people so much about — and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this — leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern American history. But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at — and saying, “it’ll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,” and I thought, “has this world gone mad?” Whenever we go — and contrary to John Quincy Adams’ advice — “searching the world for monsters to destroy,” and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our (inaudible). COOPER: Does she — does she want to use military force too rapidly? O’MALLEY: I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake. You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret. I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately — you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad’s invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you’ve been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the — for the military intervention. Senator — Secretary Clinton, you can respond. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I… WEBB: Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point? COOPER: Well — yes, you’ll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator. WEBB: Thank you. I’ve been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying. COOPER: OK. WEBB: It’s just — it’s gone back and forth over there. COOPER: Secretary? CLINTON: Well, I am in the middle, here, and… (LAUGHTER) Lots of things coming from all directions. WEBB: You got the lucky (inaudible). CLINTON: You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O’Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign. And I consider him, obviously, a friend. Let me say — because there’s a lot of loose talk going on here — we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone — which of course would be in a coalition — be put on the table is because I’m trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution. It’s about how you balance the risks. COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And I think we have an opportunity here — and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated — to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria. COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, “inevitable.” Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming? WEBB: Look, let’s start — I’ve been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes — let’s start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I’ve fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people. COOPER: Senator… WEBB: And I would say this. I’ve been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this. COOPER: You’re over your time as of now. WEBB: I will — well, you’ve let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this… COOPER: You agreed to these debate rules. WEBB: … to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that. COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond. SANDERS: Pardon me? COOPER: I’d like you to be able to respond and get in on this. SANDERS: Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that… COOPER: He doesn’t seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot. SANDERS: Well, I think he’s already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable. Should you have seen that attack coming? CLINTON: Well, let’s remember what was going on. We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I’m sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people. We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words. And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, “We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi.” Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. And I’ll say this for the Libyan people. COOPER: But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi. CLINTON: But let — I’ll get to that. But I think it’s important, since I understand Senator Webb’s very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time. And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed. But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk. COOPER: Governor O’Malley? WEBB: Can I… (CROSSTALK) O’MALLEY: Anderson, I think we are learning… (CROSSTALK) O’MALLEY: Anderson, I think there’s lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends. And I believe that’s what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today. And it’s a huge national security failing. COOPER: Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond. WEBB: Thank you. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Senator Webb? WEBB: This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack. There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings. It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can’t do it. COOPER: Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam. You’re a marine. Once a marine, always a marine. You served as a marine in Vietnam. You’re a decorated war hero. You eventually became secretary of the navy. During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector. Given his history, can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief? WEBB: Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president. I will say this, coming from the position that I’ve come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief. COOPER: Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status. SANDERS: Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Jim and I, under Jim’s leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history. We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans’ health care legislation in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: When I was a young man — I’m not a young man today. When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I am not a pacifist, Anderson. I supported the war in Afghanistan. I supported President Clinton’s effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do. Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? I want to go down the line. CHAFEE: OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I’m a strong proponent of what President Obama — and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in. No, that’s not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in. COOPER: OK. Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond. WEBB: I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran’s greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we’ve seen in the past several weeks. COOPER: Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? CHAFEE: It’s certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There’s no doubt about it. COOPER: OK. CHAFEE: And it all started with the Iraq invasion. COOPER: Governor O’Malley? O’MALLEY: I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible). COOPER: Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat? CLINTON: I — I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that’s why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that. COOPER: Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat? SANDERS: The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis. COOPER: Senator Webb? WEBB: Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East. COOPER: All right. We’re going to take a short break. Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans? That is next. We’ll be right back. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: And welcome back. We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate. The questions continue. We begin with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails. For the last eight months, you haven’t been able to put this issue behind you. You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake. What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president? CLINTON: Well, I’ve taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn’t the best choice. And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public. And you’re right. I am going to be testifying. I’ve been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to. But let’s just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. (APPLAUSE) It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that’s what they have attempted to do. I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. (APPLAUSE) And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt? COOPER: Secretary… CLINTON: How are we going to get health care for everybody… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it’s a little hard — I mean, isn’t it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue? There’s an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue. CLINTON: Well, I never said it wasn’t legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn’t happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it’s pretty clear what their obvious goal is. COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: But I’ll be there. I’ll answer their questions. But tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: Let me say this. (APPLAUSE) Let me say — let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too. Me, too. SANDERS: You know? The middle class — Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well. I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we’re going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union. Enough of the e-mails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Thank you, Bernie. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: It’s obviously very popular in this crowd, and it’s — hold on. (APPLAUSE) I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you’ve said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face? CHAFEE: Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn’t. So there’s an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That’s how I feel. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? CLINTON: No. COOPER: Governor — Governor… (APPLAUSE) Governor O’Malley… (APPLAUSE) Governor, it’s popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers. Governor O’Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, “being defined by Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.” You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight? O’MALLEY: I believe that now that we’re finally having debates, Anderson, that we don’t have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long — what the FBI’s asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why — and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table. We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable… COOPER: …Thank you, governor. O’MALLEY: …we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050. COOPER: I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Alright, Anderson, thank you very much. I’m not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me? Can’t hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said… WILKINS: …law school. My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? COOPER: The question from Arthur… LEMON: …There we go… COOPER: …Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Let’s put that question to Senator Sanders. SANDERS: Black lives matter. (CHEERING) SANDERS: And the reason — the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she’s going to end up dead in jail, or their kids… (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: …are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system… (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: …In which we have more people in jail than China. And, I intended to tackle that issue. To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor O’Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? O’MALLEY: Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color. When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction. Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn’t? CLINTON: Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so… (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: …So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice — I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world. But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we’ve got to do more about the lives of these children. That’s why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is… COOPER: …Thank you, Senator… CLINTON: …really hard to do if you don’t have early childhood education… COOPER: Senator… CLINTON: …if you don’t have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there’s a long list… (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: …We need a new New Deal for communities of color… COOPER: Senator Webb? WEBB: I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans. We’re talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide. We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn’t until then that the Republican Party started joining in. I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after — after three years. COOPER: Thanks, sir. WEBB: And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So, if you want someone who is — can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person. COOPER: Senator Sanders, let’s talk about income inequality. Wages and incomes are flat. You’ve argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s. We’ve had a Democratic president for seven years. What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn’t? SANDERS: Well, first of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world’s financial crisis was on — the world’s financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That’s where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: I’ll let you jump in a moment. Everybody will get in on this in a moment. Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue? In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class? CLINTON: Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we’ve worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs. I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It’s absolutely right. It hasn’t been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that’s why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, (inaudible). O’MALLEY: Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny’s increase in college tuition. But there’s another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he’s been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking — namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall. Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today. We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that’s a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates. COOPER: Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities. Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don’t. You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better? CLINTON: Well, my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly, it’s tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw. But we also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There’s this whole area called “shadow banking.” That’s where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from. CLINTON: So I’m with both Senator Sanders and Governor O’Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we’re going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours. SANDERS: Well, that’s not true. (LAUGHTER) COOPER: Why? SANDERS: Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. (APPLAUSE) Check the record. In the 1990s — and all due respect — in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, “what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,” Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. (APPLAUSE) Today, it is my view that when you have the three… COOPER: Senator… SANDERS: …largest banks in America — are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond. He brought you up. CLINTON: Yeah. You know, I — I respect the passion an intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 — before the big crash that we had — and I basically said, “cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.” I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we’re going to do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk. And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid… (APPLAUSE) COOPER: (inaudible) CLINTON: …and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks. COOPER: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders… CLINTON: But I’m telling you — I will say it tonight. If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees. (CROSSTALK) WEBB: Bernie, say my name so I can get into this. SANDERS: I will, just a second. WEBB: OK. Thank you. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: I’ll tell him. In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not — Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress. (APPLAUSE) And we have gotta break off these banks. Going to them… CLINTON: So… SANDERS: …and saying, “please, do the right thing”… CLINTON: …no, that’s not what… SANDERS: …is kind of naive. CLINTON: …that — I think Dodd-Frank was a very… WEBB: Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible). CLINTON: …good start, and I think that we have to implement it. We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart. We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers. (APPLAUSE) We have work to do. You’ve got no argument from me. But I know, if we don’t come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I’m recommending, we’re going to be behind instead of ahead… COOPER: Governor O’Malley? Where do you stand? CLINTON: …on what the next crisis could be. O’MALLEY: Anderson, look, this is — the big banks — I mean, once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP. And — (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton’s campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things. But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for Glass-Steagall. You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior. I am, and the people of our country need a president who’s on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. We have to fulfill… COOPER: Secretary Clinton… O’MALLEY: …our promise. COOPER: I have to let you respond. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two. We’ve been around a cumulative quite some period of time. (LAUGHTER) You know, we know that if you are learning, you’re going to change your position. I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone. But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they’d ever joined. So I’m… COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: …not taking a back seat to anybody on my values… COOPER: Thank… CLINTON: …my principles and the results that I get. COOPER: Senator Sanders… (APPLAUSE) Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that, you still voted against it. As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country’s financial stability? SANDERS: Well, I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, “guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It’s going to take the economy with them.” And you know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said, “Hank, your guys — you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?” So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse. But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: We’re going to talk about that in a minute. But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in. You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street. Is the system rigged? WEBB: There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector. And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can’t get into the discussion. COOPER: You agreed to these rules and you’re wasting time. So if you would finish your answer, we’ll move on. WEBB: All right. Well, I’m trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn’t been equal time. But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we’re going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world’s capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent. That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they’re going to get their compensation. They’re managing money from all over the world. We have to take that into consideration when we’re looking at ways to regulate it. COOPER: Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks. In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger. CHAFEE: The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I’d just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote. COOPER: Are you saying you didn’t know what you were voting for? CHAFEE: I’d just arrived at the Senate. I think we’d get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5. It was the… COOPER: Well, with all due respect, Governor… CHAFEE: But let me just say… COOPER: … what does that say about you that you’re casting a vote for something you weren’t really sure about? CHAFEE: I think you’re being a little rough. I’d just arrived at the United States Senate. I’d been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I’d been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report. But let me just say about income inequality. We’ve had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we’re going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy. So let’s go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That’s less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they’re doing fine. COOPER: Thank you, Governor. CHAFEE: So there’s still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I’m saying let’s have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion. COOPER: I want to bring in Dana Bash. CHAFEE: And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans — hard-working Americans. COOPER: Dana? BASH: Thank you. CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook. And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue. Senator Sanders, you’ve mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone. Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she’s not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump’s kids. Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children? SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today — taxes in the future than they’re paying today. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: But in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. I think we don’t need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you’re poor you have to work, and so forth and so on. I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country. (APPLAUSE) BASH: And, Secretary Clinton, it’s not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare. What’s wrong with that? CLINTON: Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt. As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. But I do believe — and maybe it’s because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school — I think it’s important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That’s why I call it a compact. BASH: Secretary Clinton… CLINTON: But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week… BASH: Can you answer the… SANDERS: … in order to make it possible for them to afford their education. And I want colleges to get their costs down. They are outrageously high in what they’re charging. BASH: Secretary Clinton, the question was not just about tuition, though. It was about Senator Sanders’ plan to expand Social Security, to make Medicare available to all Americans. Is that something that you would support? And if not, why not? CLINTON: Well, I fully support Social Security. And the most important fight we’re going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it. BASH: Do you want to expand it? CLINTON: I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security. We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn’t make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system. And I will focus — I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I’m going to defend Social Security. I’m going to look for ways to try to make sure it’s solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means. SANDERS: When the Republicans — when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by — and I don’t know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year — you don’t cut Social Security, you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol. We’re obviously in Nevada. It’s had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year. Juan Carlos? JUAN CARLOS LOPEZ, CNN EN ESPANOL ANCHOR: Gracias, Anderson. Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform. But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it. Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close? SANDERS: I didn’t leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in, they’re working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they’re thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton’s and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that. LOPEZ: Tom Harkin isn’t running for president. You are. SANDERS: I know that. But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now — and always has been — is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows. O’MALLEY: And Juan Carlos — Juan Carlos… LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton, Governor O’Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada. Do you? CLINTON: Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care. That’s why I helped to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others. I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Governor O’Malley has recommended, so that they would get the same subsidies. I think that is — it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer, it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform, when we finally do get to it. LOPEZ: Governor O’Malley? O’MALLEY: Juan Carlos, I think what you’ve heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that’s why it’s gridlocked. We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA. I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants. Do you think for a second that simply because somebody’s standing in a broken que on naturalization they’re not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn’t going to fall on to our insurance rates? I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we’re all in this together. We need comprehensive COOPER: Senator Webb… O’MALLEY: …immigration reform. It’ll make wages go up in America $250 for every year… LOPEZ: Senator Webb, do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare? WEBB: I wouldn’t have a problem with that. Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat– her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School. That’s not only American dream, that’s a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has — is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill… LOPEZ: …Thank you, Senator. WEBB: …Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards… COOPER: …Thank you, Senator. WEBB: …lost (ph) — I introduced that in 2007 — We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: I want to follow up because I think underneath Juan Carlos’ important questions, there is such a difference between everything you’re hearing here on this stage, and what we hear from the Republicans. (APPLAUSE) O’MALLEY: Here. Here. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Demonize hard-working immigrants who have insulted them. You know, I came to Las Vegas in, I think, May. Early may. Met with a group of DREAMers, I wish everybody in America could meet with this young people, to hear their stories, to know their incredible talent, their determination, and that’s why I would go further… COOPER: …Secretary… CLINTON: …than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I’m president. (CROSS TALK) COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me ask you. Two of your rivals from your left, Governor O’Malley, and Senator Sanders, want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants. Where do you stand on that? CLINTON: My plan would support any state that takes that position, and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing. COOPER: So, on the record, you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition. CLINTON: If their states agree, then we want more states to do the same thing. COOPER: Governor O’Malley? O’MALLEY: Anderson, we actually did this in my state of Maryland. We passed… (APPLAUSE) O’MALLEY: We passed a state version of the DREAM Act… (CHEERING) O’MALLEY: …And a lot of the xenophobes, the immigrant haters like some that we’ve heard like, Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party… (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) O’MALLEY: Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants. But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote. The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that’s true of children who have yet to be naturalized… COOPER: …Senator… O’MALLEY: …but will become American citizens… COOPER: Senator Sanders, you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee. You served on that committee for the last eight years, including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care. You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bi-partisan legislation. Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports, and a CNN investigation, and others, before you and your colleagues took action? SANDERS: Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action. What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines. And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them. COOPER: Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You’ve emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign. Aren’t these two things in conflict? CHAFEE: No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we’ve always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that. COOPER: Do you regret that vote? CHAFEE: No, no. As long as you’re getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant. That’s what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act? CLINTON: No, I don’t. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It’s not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind. COOPER: Senator — Senator Sanders, you’re the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001… (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one. I don’t know. COOPER: … and the reauthorization votes. Let me ask you, if elected, would you shut down the NSA surveillance program? SANDERS: I’m sorry? COOPER: Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program? SANDERS: Absolutely. Of course. COOPER: You would, point blank. SANDERS: Well, I would shut down — make — I’d shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me. But it’s not just government surveillance. I think the government is involved in our e-mails; is involved in our websites. Corporate America is doing it as well. If we are a free country, we have the right to be free. Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights. O’MALLEY (?): Anderson, the NSA… COOPER: Governor Chafee, Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero? CHAFEE: No, I would bring him home. The courts have ruled that what he did — what he did was say the American… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Bring him home, no jail time? CHAFEE: … the American government was acting illegally. That’s what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor? CLINTON: He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that. COOPER: Should he do jail time? ClINTON: In addition — in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, Snowden? (APPLAUSE) O’MALLEY: Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans’ lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that, he should be back here. COOPER: Senator Sanders, Edward Snowden? SANDERS: I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined. COOPER: Is he a hero? SANDERS: He did — he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible). COOPER: Senator Webb, Edward Snowden? WEBB: I — well, I — I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system. Here’s what I do believe. We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country. And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, “We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought — if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.” We’ve got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use. And they need to be destroyed. COOPER: Another — another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee. Name the one thing — the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama. CHAFEE: Certainly, ending the wars. We’ve got to stop these wars. You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm. We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria. They quickly join the other side. We bombed the… (CROSSTALK) COOPER: President Obama’s generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out. Would you keep them there? CHAFEE: I’d like to finish my question — my answer. And also we just bombed a hospital. We’ve had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. So I would change how we — our approach to the Middle East. We need a new paradigm in the Middle East. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, how would you be different than President Obama’s administration? O’MALLEY: I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama? CLINTON: Well, I think that’s pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we’ve had up until this point, including President Obama. COOPER: Is there a policy difference? CLINTON: Well, there’s a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I’m laying out, to go beyond. And that’s in my economic plans, how I would deal with the prescription drug companies, how I would deal with college, how I would deal with a full range of issues that I’ve been talking about throughout this campaign to go further. COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: I have a lot of respect for president Obama. I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues. But here’s where I do disagree. I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama? WEBB: I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I — Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come. And I don’t think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority. I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we’re doing. So I would lead — working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph). COOPER: Senator Sanders, he cited you. You don’t hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution. What do you mean? SANDERS: What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest. We need to raise public consciousness. We need the American people to know what’s going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know. (APPLAUSE) And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we could bring the kind of change we need. O’MALLEY: Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution. What we need is a green energy revolution. We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. COOPER: And we want to — and we’re going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up. Some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have pretty much — probably everybody in this room. (LAUGHTER) Others have not. Does that influence — does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate. It has been quite a night so far. We are in the final block of this debate. All the candidates are back, which I’m very happy to see. (LAUGHTER) COOPER: It’s a long story. Let’s continue, shall we? Secretary Clinton, welcome back. CLINTON: Well, thank you. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: You know, it does take me a little longer. That’s all I can say. COOPER: That’s right. Secretary Clinton, Governor O’Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families. This year has been the year of the outsider in politics, just ask Bernie Sanders. Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself? CLINTON: Well, I can’t think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I’m not just running because I would be the first woman president. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I’m running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds. And I know what it takes to get things done. I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground. And I think we’re going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we’re talking about up here accomplished. So I’m very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people. COOPER: Governor O’Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn’t get the crown? O’MALLEY: Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation. And I will share with you that I’ve traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there’s two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again. And they’re the phrases “new leadership” and “getting things done.” We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward. I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country. But our country needs new leadership to move forward. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want. CLINTON: Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. I would ask them to listen to what I’m proposing, look at what I’ve accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion. I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton. I’m campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States. COOPER: (inaudible). (APPLAUSE) Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff? SANDERS: I think — I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC. (APPLAUSE) I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties — 100,000 people in this country — watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. COOPER: we’ve got — we — a lot of questions we’ve got about climate change, and we’re gonna go to Don Lemon. Don? LEMON: All right. This one is for Martin O’Malley. Anderson, Governor O’Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: As a young person, I’m very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future. As a presidential candidate, what will you do to address climate change? (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: So, Governor O’Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage. O’MALLEY: Yeah. Anna, I have put forward a plan — and I’m the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this — to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one. So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We’re here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design. We can get there as a nation, but it’s going to require presidential leadership. And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the — an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. COOPER: Governor… O’MALLEY: We can do it. COOPER: …Governor O’Malley, thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats. You’re pro-coal, you’re pro-offshore drilling, you’re pro-Keystone pipeline. Are — again, are you — the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party? WEBB: Well, the — the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change? And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I’m a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here. We’ve done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they’re the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It’s a global problem and I have been very strong on — on doing that. The — the agreements — the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the — of the Chinese government itself. So let’s solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a — a way to address climate change. COOPER: Senator Sanders, are you tougher on — on climate change than Secretary Clinton? SANDERS: Well, I will tell you this. I believe — and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly. I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon. And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change… (APPLAUSE) …and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively. This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia. COOPER: Senator — thank you, Senator. SANDERS: The planet — the future of the planet is at stake. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I’m gonna go to (ph) (inaudible). CLINTON: Well, that — that’s exactly what I’ve been doing. When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world. They told us they’d left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, “We’ve been looking all over for you. Let’s sit down and talk about what we need to do.” And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed. Thanks to President Obama’s leadership, it’s now gone much further. COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant. Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there. COOPER: Dana Bash? BASH: Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave. CLINTON: Mm-hmm. BASH: Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, “hire fewer people and create fewer jobs.” What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can’t afford it? CLINTON: Well, I’m surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years. And it’s… BASH: It’s on the federal level. CLINTON: Well, but all — well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world. And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. And I think this is — this is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses. I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I’m supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law. I know what it’s like. And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms. I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row. She’s been a champion of this. We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I’m talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it. BASH: But Secretary — Secretary Clinton, even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today’s day and age. There are so many people who say, “Really? Another government program? Is that what you’re proposing? And at the expense of taxpayer money?” CLINTON: Well, look, you know, when people say that — it’s always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, “You can’t have paid leave, you can’t provide health care.” They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it. (APPLAUSE) You know, we can do these things. (APPLAUSE) We should not be paralyzed — we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, “big government this, big government that,” that except for what they want to impose on the American people. I know we can afford it, because we’re going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done. COOPER: Thank you. Senator Sanders? SANDERS: Yeah, Dana, here’s the point: Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. We are the only major country. That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family — paid family and medical leave. (APPLAUSE) Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can’t do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That’s not what the American people want. COOPER: Governor O’Malley? O’MALLEY: Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave. And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren’t penalized in having to drop out of the workforce. My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and — and keeping jobs and moving forwards. We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave. COOPER: Governor, thank you. The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana. I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez. LOPEZ: Thank you, Anderson. Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot. You’ve said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn’t quite work for you. If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote? SANDERS: I suspect I would vote yes. (APPLAUSE) And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs… (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: …which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we’ve got a lot of work to do in that area. O’MALLEY: Juan Carlos? (APPLAUSE) LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn’t smoke pot when you were young, and you’re not going to start now. (LAUGHTER) LOPEZ: When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let’s wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington. It’s been more than a year since you’ve said that. Are you ready to take a position tonight? CLINTON: No. I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today. I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we’re going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief. So, I think we’re just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana. Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don’t have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question. LEMON: Alright, Anderson. This is for Senator Sanders, OK? This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, “President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda. How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?” Senator? SANDERS: The Republican party, since I’ve been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists. Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no. Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President… (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: …But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can’t refuse. If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, “We know what’s going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job.” (APPLAUSE) COOPER: We’re going to hear from all the candidates coming up. We’re going to take a short break. More from the candidates in a moment. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate. This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to — 15 seconds if you can. Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.” You’ve all made a few people upset over your political careers. Which enemy are you most proud of? (LAUGHTER) CHAFEE: I guess the coal lobby. I’ve worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I’m proud to be at odds with the coal lobby. COOPER: Governor O’Malley? O’MALLEY: The National Rifle Association. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. (LAUGHTER) Probably the Republicans. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Webb? WEBB: I’d have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he’s not around right now to talk to. COOPER: All right. Time for closing statements. Each of you will have 90 seconds. Governor Chafee, let’s begin with you. CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate. America has many challenges confronting us — ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans. We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges? I’ve served in government at many levels. I know what it’s like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island. But what I’m most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I’m most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure — political pressure, public pressure. But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we live now with the consequences. CHAFEE: So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. And I’m running for president to end the wars. I want to be the peacemaker. I am a proven peacemaker. Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor Chafee, thank you very much. Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds. WEBB: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s been a pleasure to be with you tonight. You’ve heard a lot of promises up here; you’ve heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election’s over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done. One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I’ve always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution. We did it with criminal justice reform. We’ve had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government. I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of — of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House. COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much. Governor O’Malley, you have 90 seconds. O’MALLEY: Anderson, thank you. I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very — and all of you watching at home — was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates. (APPLAUSE) On this stage — on this stage, you didn’t hear anyone denigrate women, you didn’t hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn’t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief. What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you’ve become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. (APPLAUSE) That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor O’Malley, thank you very much. Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds. SANDERS: This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country. We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and — and parental leave — family and parental leave to all of our families. Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life. Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions. And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com. We are averaging $30 bucks apiece. We would appreciate your help. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Thank you very much, Anderson. And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. That’s in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president. What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people? Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. It’s whether you get back up. America’s been knocked down. That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. And although we’ve made progress, we’re standing but not running the way America needs to. My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. Please join me in this campaign. Please come and make it clear that America’s best days are still ahead. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate. On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee. Thanks also to Dana Bash, Juan Carlos Lopez, and Don Lemon. We’ll be back in Las Vegas December 15th, when CNN hosts our next Republican presidential debate. That will be moderated by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer. Correction: The original version of this story misquoted Sanders’ comments on gun purchases. Sanders said he has “strongly supported instant background checks” for gun buyers over the years. Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/10/04/donald-trump-guns-mass-shootings_n_8240916.html,"Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump said Sunday that lives would have been saved if more people had guns at the Oregon community college where a mass shooting took place this past week. ""I can make the case that if there were guns in that room other than [the shooter's], fewer people would have died. Fewer people would have been so horribly injured,"" Trump said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The real estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate rejected the argument that lax gun laws are to blame for the abundance of mass shootings in the United States, noting that cities with strict gun laws, like Chicago and Baltimore, still have high rates of gun violence. ""The strongest, the most stringent laws are in almost every case the worse places,"" Trump claimed. ""It doesn't seem to work."" He acknowledged that the U.S. has a higher rate of school shootings than other countries. But he faulted mental illness and ""copycat"" behavior that leads troubled individuals to imitate mass shooters, not the availability of guns. ""Guns, no guns, it doesn't matter,"" he said. ""You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks."" In fact, people with mental illnesses are no more likely to commit acts of violence than anybody else. They commit just 3 to 5 percent of all violent incidents, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump's comments echo those of conservatives who have claimed that Umpqua Community College was a gun-free zone. In fact, the college's ban on firearms and other weapons has a significant exception: In accordance with Oregon state law, students with licenses to carry a concealed gun may do so on campus.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2015/10/04/25000-strong-in-boston-for-bernie-not-much-on-taxes/,"Reports I have read on the Bernie Sanders rally at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center yesterday indicate attendance of 25,000, a five block line waiting to get in and thousands left out in the cold.  I can at least partially confirm some of that.  The room in the expo center was very big and very full.  My place in the line seemed to be a couple of blocks away from the center and there were plenty of people behind me and the retired school superintendent I had car pooled with.  It wasn't really cold though - more blustery.  Two other observations.  The crowd was very young and pretty white.  My big disappointment was that there was not that much on taxes, but maybe that is something of a tax story.  We'll get to that. BOSTON, MA - OCTOBER 3: Supporters of Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders listen during... [+] a rally at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) Getting In We'd been warned to get there early and had.  Frank and I met up in Westborough at 3:00 and were at the Center not much after 3:30 for the event that was slated to start at 6:00. I sprung the extra ten bucks for valet parking.  Then we had to hike to the end of the line, which was already a considerable distance although we were assured that we still had a good chance to get in.  While waiting people came along trying to sell us buttons and get us to sign petitions. There were a couple of requests for signatures for  a ""millionaires tax"" that would tack an additional 4% in state income tax onto people with incomes over $1,000,000.  The Massachusetts income tax rate of 5.15% is pretty middle of the road and by the state constitution has to remain flat, which is why the ballot question is needed to change it.  The thing about Massachusetts is that unless you stay on the East West thoroughfares like the Mass Pike and Route 20, you can't drive much over forty miles without crossing a state line, which might makes millionaire flight pretty easy. The other thing about the proposal is that it made me pine for the good old days when ""millionaire"" meant someone with a net worth of a million dollars, which I might actually aspire to soaking wet after a full meal with the wind at my back. We mostly chatted with an official of the ironworkers local who said that his local is all for Bernie, but the national union is not on board yet.  He told us that he is a third-generation ironworker with roots in Newfoundland.  Apparently the maritime tradition of climbing up on masts and the like translates into ironworking. Who knew? BOSTON, MA - OCTOBER 3: Supporters of Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders listen during... [+] a rally at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) The Warm-up After we finally got into the venue, there was a pretty long period of standing around as the room filled.  The traffic direction was handled pretty smoothly by the volunteers. Several hours of standing on a hard floor is tough on old guys like me and Frank, but the youth did not seem to be disturbed.  I wandered off after agreeing that we would meet under the huge American flag.  It might have been a mistake, since Frank and I had had a prime vantage point and I ended up far enough away from the lectern that I did not get any decent pictures.

Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) I ended up mostly chatting with some Harvard students.  They were interesting guys, attorneys who are getting Harvard LLMs, all from other countries - Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Pakistan.  The thing that bothered them most about Bernie is that, from their perspective, he is weak on gun control.  The Aussie told me that there had been one mass shooting in Australia and that was it they rounded up all the guns.  I didn't do a very good job of explaining why that would not be something worth trying in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Finally Symone Sanders, Bernie's new National Press Secretary, a young African American woman, took the stage, perhaps an indication that future crowds might not be so dominated by the melanin deficient.  (I didn't catch the name of the fellow who had come on before her.)  Prior to the main event she introduced four speakers who nicely linked his outreach to organized labor and concern about health care, students and the environment. Karen Higgins, President of the National Nurses Union spoke about ""breaking the class ceiling"" and Bernie being for education not incarceration and the that he would be the President of the 99%.  Jimmy O'Brien President of the Boston Carmen's Union spoke about a move to privatize parts of the MBTA.  They were followed by Jillian Brownsford, a nursing student at UMass-Boston and environmental author Bill McKibben, who took off his hat to show us he was as gray as Bernie.

(Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) It sometimes seems to me that Republicans when at all possible want to be seen as running against the IRS and Lois Lerner.  Bernie Sanders wants to be seen as running against Citizens United and the Koch brothers.   He let us know that he does not represent the billionaire class and does not want their money.  Although I found this intriguing group called Patriotic Millionaires who are in favor of higher taxes, something tells me  Billionaires for Bernie, will not be a thing, so the image of him spurning their money will probably remain hypothetical. I think ""Koch"" may have been the only name he mentioned more than once and it was always good for a rousing boo.  There were some interesting zingers as when he talked about Republicans being in a parallel universe and being a national embarrassment as a political party that refuses to believe science when it comes to climate change.  He talked about how as husband, father and grandfather that he supports family values, but just does not think that that includes interfering with how women control their own bodies and preventing gay people from marrying one another.  Pretty  sure that part rated the biggest cheers. We heard about the grotesque level of inequality and the impossibility of surviving on $7.25 per hour.  He also called for amnesty and a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people living among us. On Taxes Much to my disappointment, the only mention of taxes was in the part about providing tuition-free public education.  It would be financed by a ""tax on Wall Street speculation"".  For whatever it is worth Tim Worstall in his piece - Bernie Sanders And His Adventures With The Magic Money Tree - argues that scored dynamically the Financial Transactions Tax being floated by Sanders is a revenue loser.  I don't think too many people in the crowd have read that.  Personally, I remain agnostic on the Final Transactions Tax, although every time I have mentioned it I have heard that it would turn lower Manhattan into a ghost town or something like that. So I remain waiting for the other shoe to drop on the Sanders tax plan.  The high points of the unofficial summary I received from the campaign were lifting the cap on earnings subject to social security tax and taxing dividends and capital gains the same as ordinary income.  There was not mention of an increase in the top marginal rate.  Given his interest in rebuilding the middle class, it might be worth reflecting that in any given year, some of the high incomes and capital gains are middle-class people having a brief moment in the sun when a small business or rental building tended for decades is sold.  Maybe they are thinking about that in crafting their plan.  We can hope. How Many People Are Feeling The Bern? Yesterday is pretty good evidence that there is quite a bit of enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders.  Several of my Jewish friends have told me that the country is just not ready for a Jewish President, but I really think that that ship has sailed.  If the Sanders campaign can craft a tax plan that could conceivably pay for everything without squashing real entrepreneurs, he might find support in all sorts of odd places.  Oddly enough, Jeb Bush with his proposal to eliminate the deduction for business interest may have failed in that regard.  I just hope that Sanders doesn't go crazy with the top marginal rate. We'll see. If you don't believe I was really there.  The evidence is at 00:15 on this clip.  I have been a CPA for over 30 years focusing on taxation.

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/atf-thomas-brandon-acting-head-demotion-214542,"ATF agents inspect an apartment building in Los Angeles after a raid. The White House will opt to leave the top job at the ATF vacant, avoiding a potentially difficult nomination battle amid a larger ongoing debate over gun control. | AP Photo The move is aimed at avoiding a confirmation battle at the scandal-plagued agency blamed for the 'Fast and Furious' gun-running operation. By SARAH WHEATON 10/08/2015 08:56 AM EDT Updated 10/08/2015 11:15 AM EDT The White House thinks the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is doing such a great job, they’re planning to demote him. The unusual move allows the administration, which has said fighting gun violence is a top priority, to avoid a nasty confirmation hearing for a troubled agency. The Obama administration has no plans to name a permanent director for the agency, and career agent Thomas Brandon has been serving as the acting chief since April. But by law, he can’t hold that interim title for longer than 120 days, and that clock runs out on Oct. 27. Brandon confirmed to POLITICO that he has agreed to stay on while re-assuming his previous title of deputy director – but still serving as the agency’s highest-ranking official. “We're not going to nominate you, but we have full confidence in you if you stay at the ATF,” Brandon said, recounting the explanation he received from the White House. ""If they don't nominate anybody and I revert back to just the deputy director, but I'm still the CEO, I will give the taxpayers what I've always given them: a hard day's work,'' Brandon said in an interview Wednesday following a summit on violent crime hosted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The arrangement would leave the federal agency in charge of regulating the firearms industry and investigating illegal guns without an official leader indefinitely, even as gun violence has once again become an administration priority. President Barack Obama has vowed to do all he can to reduce gun violence in the wake of last week's college shooting in Roseburg, Oregon -– where he plans to travel to pay respects to the victims on Friday -– all while continuing to castigate Congress for refusing to pass new gun control laws. By BURGESS EVERETT and SEUNG MIN KIM A White House official did not deny that Brandon's title would be changing even as he remains the ATF's top-ranked official, adding that he “is currently fulfilling the role and is providing the outstanding leadership the Bureau needs at this time.” The ATF has faced chronic vacancies since 2006 when Congress started requiring that appointees win Senate approval for the top position, which oversees 2,500 agents charged with enforcing federal laws on alcohol, tobacco and firearms. In recent years, the bureau has faced continuing accusations of scandal and mismanagement, most notably the “Fast and Furious” gun-running operation in which the agency sold weapons to Mexican drug cartels in an effort to track them. In fact, the ATF has only had one permanent director under Obama: B. Todd Jones. His confirmation became a priority as part of a flurry of executive activity to reduce gun violence in early 2013 in response to the mass shooting of 20 schoolchildren and six educators in Newtown, Conn. But Jones left on March 31 to take a job at the National Football League. Brandon, then Jones’s deputy, has been serving as acting director since. Over the summer, the administration showed signs that it planned to nominate Brandon to the position permanently, but it later reversed course. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, who would oversee any ATF confirmation hearings, has stepped up his criticism of the agency recently. On Sept. 14, he wrote to Lynch expressing concerns about whistleblowers’ claims of sexual harassment at the bureau -- and their accusation that Brandon and Jones were both aware of the allegations. Grassley said on Wednesday that such issues would definitely come up in confirmation hearings for a future ATF director. “There’s no question that anybody nominated to lead the ATF will face difficult questions about the agency and its future,” Grassley said in an email. “There are far too many questionable activities going on at the agency like the alleged sexual harassment and discrimination that the Judiciary Committee is investigating.” Brandon joined the ATF in 1989, after spending four years in the Marines. He spent most of his career in the Detroit field division, rising to the top rank there before taking charge of the Phoenix field division in the wake of Fast and Furious. But he was only there for about two months before moving to Washington to be the bureau’s deputy director in October 2011. Brandon, 55, could have retired five years ago. “But I’m a public servant and remain that,” he said. The mission of the ATF is “in my blood,” he said, saying he is committed to the ATF “troops” and holds respect for the Justice Department’s top officials. To keep up morale in the face of the leadership vacancy, Brandon said he plans “a lot of internal messaging, and I do know that the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, and the White House have said they want to show a lot of support to me.” He also said he expected the current political emphasis on guns would ensure that ATF remains a top administration priority. But gun control advocates aren’t so sure. Congress By BURGESS EVERETT “As a matter of policy and politics, it's clear that President Obama should nominate an exceptionally well-qualified law enforcement veteran to be the nation's top cop in the fight against illegal guns,” said Arkadi Gerney, a senior vice president of the Center for American Progress who has also advocated folding the ATF into the FBI. “If the Republican-led Senate, which claims to want to enforce the laws on the books, fails to confirm the nominee -- well, then it's on them."" The ATF has long suffered something of an identity crisis, growing out of an agency first created by the Treasury Department to collect taxes on tobacco and liquor in the late 1800s. Guns became part of the portfolio in the 1930s, and they became its main focus in the second half of the 20th century. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the ATF moved under the umbrella of the Justice Department. Brandon was philosophical about being asked to take a drop in stature while holding the same authority, paraphrasing a quote from Gen. Colin Powell: ""Don't align the position so close to your ego that your ego goes with it."" The agent currently serving as acting deputy director, Ronald Turk, would remain Brandon’s No. 2. It’s unclear what his job title would be, Brandon said, but Turk would be the equivalent of the Chief Operating Officer to his chief executive role. “We’re in uncharted waters here,"" Brandon said, ""and looking long-term.""

Monday, 05 October 2015 04:41 PM Clinton detailed proposals Monday aimed at closing gun-sale loopholes and holding sellers more accountable for how the weapons are used. President Barack Obama last week said he would pressure Congress to enact legislation that would curb firearms violence after a gunman killed nine people in Oregon. “There’s a joke in the firearms industry that President Obama is the world’s best gun salesman and there is data to support increased purchases of firearms heading into the 2008 and 2012 elections,” said Andrea James, an analyst with Dougherty & Co. “Of course, Hillary Clinton is vying for the same job.” Smith & Wesson, whose brands also include M&P and Thompson/Center Arms, surged 7.3 percent to close at $17.81 in New York, the biggest one-day jump since Aug. 28. Sturm Ruger, maker of Ruger American, Gunsite Scout and Hawkeye weapons, increased 2.6 percent to $57.93. Retailers that sell firearms also benefited. Cabela’s Inc. gained 2.9 percent to $45.40, while Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. increased 2.5 percent to $52.28. Past Surges The gunmakers’ shares have seen gains in recent years in the wake of mass shootings that have led to increased calls for gun-ownership restrictions. Both companies also have seen sales rise in response to the politicians’ demands for tougher legislation. Those efforts have all fizzled. “The threat of legislation can cause temporary buying surges,” said James, who has a buy rating on both gunmakers. “The best thing for firearms demand is to have the constant threat of legislation without ever actually having the legislation.” James estimated that firearms sales will rise at about two times the U.S. gross domestic product, as more women, young people, and urban dwellers want personal protection and as target shooting increases in popularity. “Target shooting is basically the new bowling,” James said. The Oregon mass shooting occurred Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg. The gunman then killed himself, authorities said.  © Copyright 2021 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senators-to-scrutinize-betsy-devos-trumps-pick-for-education-secretary/2017/01/17/3a0e6168-da8f-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.01df103e08b0,"Democrats attacked Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump’s education nominee, calling her unfit for the job during a contentious confirmation hearing Tuesday evening, while Republicans defended her as a bold reformer who would disrupt the status quo in U.S. education. DeVos told skeptical senators that she looked forward to working with them to improve the nation’s schools. But she sidestepped several issues important to Democrats and their allies, declining to take a position on whether guns belong in schools or to commit to upholding the Obama administration’s aggressive approach to handling sexual assault on college campuses, and she called Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (D-Vt.) ideas about free college “interesting.” A Michigan billionaire, DeVos has lobbied for decades to expand charter schools and taxpayer-funded vouchers for private and religious schools, but she has no professional experience in public schools, never attended public schools or sent her own children to public schools. She also has not held public office. [Trump could reverse Obama’s actions on sexual assault, transgender rights] DeVos’s inexperience in the realm of public education appeared at times to be a liability. During rapid-fire questioning by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), she seemed to demonstrate a lack of understanding of one of education’s major federal civil rights laws, which requires states that take federal funding to provide children with disabilities the services they need to benefit from a public education. DeVos said states should decide whether schools should be required to meet those special-education requirements. “So some states might be good to kids with disabilities, and other states might not be so good, and then what, people can just move around the country if they don’t like how their kids are being treated?” Kaine said. When Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) — who has a son with a disability — challenged DeVos to explain whether she understood that the law was a federal civil rights law, DeVos said she “may have confused it.” DeVos also declined to say whether she believes that all schools receiving taxpayer funding — public, public charter, or private — should be held accountable to the same performance standards. She also declined to say whether such schools should be required to report suspensions and expulsions, and incidents of bullying and harassment, to the federal government. Joe Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, introduced DeVos Tuesday and vouched for her leadership, arguing that her status as an outsider is an asset. “She doesn’t come from within the education establishment. But honestly, I believe that today that’s one of the most important qualifications you could have for this job,” the former senator from Connecticut said. “We need a change agent.” DeVos is an unusually polarizing nominee for education secretary; most of her recent predecessors have sailed through the confirmation process, winning Senate approval on voice votes. The strong feelings about DeVos were evident in the line of more than 100 people waiting to enter the Capitol Hill hearing room Tuesday evening, including supportive students in plaid uniforms and bright yellow scarves embroidered with “National School Choice Week,” and a large contingent of parents and teens from Detroit who came by bus to oppose DeVos’s nomination. GOP senators cheered DeVos’s nomination, saying they hope she will champion alternatives to the nation’s public schools and scale back the federal footprint in K-12 education. [Teachers unions mount campaign against Betsy DeVos] “Betsy DeVos, in my opinion, is on our children’s side,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, said in his opening remarks Tuesday. “She’s devoted her life to helping mainly low-income children have access to better schools.” Alexander dismissed DeVos’s critics as out of step with public opinion, arguing that Democrats, including President Obama, have embraced charter schools, and that vouchers are patterned on “the most successful social policy this Congress has ever enacted — the GI Bill,” which provides tuition assistance for veterans to attend the college of their choice. “Why is such a great idea for colleges deemed to be such a dangerous idea for K-12 schools?” Alexander said. He restricted senators to one five-minute round of questions, saying he was adhering to committee precedent and the “golden rule,” treating Trump’s pick as the committee treated Obama’s nominees. Democrats were dismayed, arguing that the committee has never before cut off questions, and that they needed more time to examine DeVos’s record. “I think we’re selling our kids short by not being able to ask follow up questions,” said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). Franken had asked DeVos for her views on the debate — common in education circles — about whether standardized tests should measure the progress students make during a year, or their grade-level proficiency. He was unimpressed with what he said was her lack of familiarity with that debate. “I’m surprised you don’t know this issue,” Franken said. Teachers unions and civil rights groups have argued that DeVos’s support for a free-market approach to education has undermined public schools, which they see as a critical civic institution. DeVos’s opponents also point to the fact that she has no record on higher education or protecting children’s civil rights, two areas critical to the work of the department she aims to lead. [Betsy DeVos and her family members are major donors to the senators who will vote on her confirmation] Asked about her relatives’ contributions to anti-LGBT groups, DeVos said she believes in equality: “I believe in the innate value of every single human being and that all students, no matter their age, should be able to attend a school and feel safe and be free of discrimination,” she said. But she declined, under questioning from Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat, to say whether she plans to rein in the Office for Civil Rights, which investigates allegations of discrimination in schools. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked questions about DeVos’s qualifications to run the trillion-dollar federal student loan program, with DeVos acknowledging that she has no experience running or managing anything near the size and complexity of the program. DeVos also acknowledged that she had never taken out a federal student loan for herself or her children. [Dems raise concerns about possible links between DeVos and student debt collection agency] DeVos declined to take a stand on whether guns belong in schools, saying that decision should be left to local and state officials. She pointed to a rural Wyoming school that is surrounded by a fence to keep bears out: “I would imagine there’s probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.” Asked by gun control advocate Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — whose constituents include parents who lost children in the mass shooting at Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 — whether she would support Trump if he moves forward with his proposal to ban gun-free school zones, she said she would “support what the president-elect does.” The hearing went forward Tuesday evening over the objections of Democrats, who are concerned that the Office of Government Ethics, which is responsible for vetting presidential nominees for potential conflicts of interest, has not finished its review of DeVos’s vast wealth and financial investments. Alexander has said that the committee won’t vote until the ethics office’s work is complete. DeVos promised to resolve any conflicts of interest the office identifies. “I will not be conflicted, period,” she said. “I commit that to you all.” She said that if confirmed, she will be a “strong advocate for great public schools.” But when public schools are “troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child,” she said, parents should have a “right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.” “I share President-elect Trump’s view that it’s time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve,” she said. [Betsy DeVos omitted $125,000 anti-union political donation from Senate disclosure form] On the campaign trail, Trump proposed a new $20 billion grant program to encourage states to expand such efforts, but he offered few details about how that might work, and there is a tension between the incoming administration’s interest in expanding vouchers and charter schools and conservatives’ interest in leaving decisions about education to states and school districts. DeVos said Tuesday that she would not coerce states to expand vouchers or charters. But in an exchange with Murray, she also refused to say that she would not work to privatize schools. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), an advocate for vouchers and charters, called DeVos a champion for low-income children who don’t have access to great schools. “Mrs. DeVos is not opposed to accountability,” he said, rejecting one of the Democrats’ charges against her. “What she is opposed to is leaving children trapped in schools that we know are failing, failing the very students that will have no hope if they do not receive a high-quality education.” Ed O’Keefe contributed to this report.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/VasQ0CebjGA/,"Liberal documentarian Michael Moore praised President Obama’s response to the horrific mass shooting in Oregon this week, calling Obama’s renewed calls for gun control “awesome” and expressing hope that the president would take action before he leaves office. The director’s comments came Friday afternoon at the New York Film Festival premiere of his new documentary Where to Invade Next, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film follows Moore as he “invades” other countries to explore what America could learn from them. “I am, as I said in the film, an optimist. I’m not a cynic, I don’t think it’s all f***ed,” Moore told the audience after the screening. “I feel like that sometimes, especially when things happen like yesterday’s shooting in Oregon, what do we do about that? [President Obama’s response] was awesome, and he inches his way toward that place where he needs to go. I hope he goes there. He’s got a year left.” Of course, Moore’s position on gun control is not exactly a surprise; the director’s 2002 film Bowling for Columbine, a critical look at gun culture in the United States, won him a Best Documentary Oscar and cemented his status as America’s premiere progressive documentarian. Moore couldn’t help but refer to his earlier film while discussing the shooting deaths in Oregon: “We’re like, ‘what’s the point of making that film? Here we are, 13 years later.’ But we know that’s the rabbit hole not to go down, because as I said at the end of the film, we know things can change and will change.” “I said after Newtown — and I didn’t say this glibly and it’s upsetting to think about — if they actually showed the crime scene photo of 20 first graders with their heads blown off, how long would the NRA stay in power?” he added. Moore also weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, saying he doesn’t believe a Republican could win the White House because of the country’s shifting demographics. “Seventy-nine percent of the United States are either women, people of color or between the ages of 18 and 30,” Moore explained. “Young people. That’s the block you have to win to get elected. That’s 79 percent of the country! Women, people of color, young people. Donald Trump has none of those blocks! He can’t win the majority of any of those blocks.” He continued: “The candidate [who will win] will appeal to the issues that women care about, that young people care about, and acknowledge that black lives matter and there are people of color in this country that have made it what it is. When they debated the GOP [and say] the American people, they’re thinking of the white guy, or the angry white guy, and that’s just not America anymore. That America is over. It is more of the melting pot… To just ignore that or to not address that or to say that you have the right to regulate a woman’s uterus but not guns? It’s like, I think the only safe place for guns is in a woman’s uterus, then they would be regulated by our Republican Congress!” While his new film examines so much of what America has gotten wrong, Moore thinks America has gotten things right in at least one respect: “In terms of public policy, we elected Barack Obama over John McCain — that was a good idea, I think. I think that saved us a little bit… There’s a lot of great things about us.” Where to Invade Next will be distributed by a new joint venture formed by former Radius-TWC executives Tom Quinn and Jason Janego, and Alamo Drafthouse CEO Tim League.

http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/10/03/time-to-retire-the-phrase-trigger-warning/#disqus_thread,"America’s college campuses have been dominated by the political left for decades. The latest manifestation of that dominance is the “trigger warning”–a signal to students and faculty that they may be about to hear a politically incorrect idea that might cause some discomfort, or provoke (heaven forbid!) an unusual or unexpected thought. Yet after yet another mass shooting on campus, the time may have come to retire the phrase “trigger warning” itself. The disconnect between the violence that students have actually faced, and the sort of imagined psychological harm they are thought to risk in what used to be called academic debate, is beyond jarring. Words have meaning, and the use of violent imagery to describe the non-violent process of higher learning is offensive–not ban-this-word-lest-any-potential-members-of-a-victimized-group-feel-uncomfortable, but just repulsive, as in poor intellectual taste. We are shielding students from thoughts, but not from weapons. It is well past time to recognize that the common denominator in recent mass shootings is the fact that most of the targets were unguarded. The Umpqua Community College reportedly had one guard, who was unarmed. It seems easier and more effective to make sure someone at school can deter a would-be shooter, rather than trying to pry handguns away from millions of law-abiding citizens. The left is obsessed with pursuing campus “rape culture” and creating “safe spaces”–emotionally and intellectually safe, that is. Little thought seems to have gone into the physical protection of students, whether at colleges or high schools. Since there is virtually no gun law–short of repealing the Second Amendment–that would have stopped the shooter at Umpqua, perhaps it is worth exploring a fewalternative proposals? Or does that idea need a trigger warning? 2nd AmendmentEducationLocalacademiaMass ShootingsNRApolitical correctnessrape culturetrigger warningUmpqua Community College .

http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/trump-carries-gun-sometimes/2015/10/11/id/695670/?ns_mail_uid=38413596,"Sunday, 11 October 2015 10:44 AM Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump says he sometimes carries a gun to protect himself, after a spate of shootings at colleges ramped up debate about firearms in the United States. The revelation is likely to spark a backlash from advocates calling for tighter control of guns, after three separate shootings at US universities or colleges this month left 11 people dead. Asked why years ago he obtained a concealed weapons permit, Trump told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"": ""Because I like to have myself protected."" Host John Dickerson then asked Trump: ""Do you carry?"" ""Sometimes,"" replied Trump, whose popularity has surged on the back of a series of bombastic comments on a range of sensitive topics, including immigration and gun control. Last week, days after a gunman shot dead nine people at a college in Oregon on October 1, Trump  said that gun laws had ""nothing to do"" with the spate of shootings and that such incidents were simply a fact of life. The mass shooting at the community college in Roseburg was ""horrible,"" Trump told CBS. ""Had somebody in that room had a gun, the result would've been better,"" he said, adding that ""I feel much better being armed.""  © AFP 2021 Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/highlights-outtakes-from-obama-60-minutes-interview/,"Steve Kroft asks President Obama about the crisis in Syria, mass shootings -- and what he thinks of Donald Trump With the end of his second term on the horizon, President Obama spoke to 60 Minutes this week, reflecting on his achievements -- and on the problems not yet solved. At the top of that list is the protracted crisis in Syria, where more than 250,000 people have died, according to UN reports, and some 12 million have been forced from their homes. Correspondent Steve Kroft asks President Obama about the lack of progress in Syria, but Obama says improvement takes time. ""In a situation that is as volatile and with as many players as there are inside of Syria, there aren't any silver bullets,"" he says. One of those players, Kroft points out, is Russia, which recently stepped up airstrikes and naval bombardments in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. President Putin ""is challenging your leadership, Mr. President,"" Kroft says. Obama disagrees. ""Steve, I've got to tell you, if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in in order to prop up your only ally, is leadership, then we've got a different definition of leadership,"" he says. Kroft and Obama discuss domestic issues as well, including gun violence. At a press conference after last week's mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama urged the country to do more to prevent these tragedies. In the unaired clip below, Kroft asks the president if he can personally make a difference. Obama acknowledges that his options are limited.  ""We are running out of administrative actions that could really move the needle in reducing gun violence in this country,"" he says. At the same time, he adds, ""it is not realistic to think that this Congress will pass any common sense gun safety legislation."" But that doesn't mean a public outcry can't effect change, Obama says. ""The most important thing I can do right now is just to keep on lifting up the issue and saying, 'It doesn't have to be this way,'"" he tells Kroft. ""I genuinely believe that."" The two-part interview also touches on the 2016 presidential race, and the candidates on both sides of the aisle. Kroft asks the president what he thinks of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. ""He is, you know, the classic reality TV character,"" Obama says. ""At these early stages, it's not surprising that he's gotten a lot of attention.""  As to whether that attention will evaporate, the president declines to speculate. ""I'll leave it up to the pundits to make that determination,"" Obama says. ""I don't think he'll end up being president of the United States."" At different moments in the interview, the president turns reflective, taking stock of his time in office and eyeing the year ahead. In the unaired clip below, he tells Kroft that, at this point, he's learned to trust his instincts.  ""The nice thing about being a veteran in anything is your fear kind of goes away,"" he says. ""There's no doubt I'm better at this job now than I was when I started."" At the end of the interview, Kroft asks Obama if he's glad he can't run for president again. Obama says he feels a mixture of satisfaction at what he's accomplished and a desire to still do more. ""But by the time I'm finished, I think it will be time for me to go,"" he says, adding that new blood in the White House is essential for a healthy democracy.  ""Do you think if you ran again, could run again, and did run again, you would be elected?"" Kroft asks. ""Yes,"" says Obama, without missing a beat.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/us/politics/martin-omalley-counting-on-debate-to-urge-voters-to-think-beyond-2-democrats.html?ref=politics&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland has been introducing himself to Democratic voters for months in speeches, at rubber-chicken dinners and most recently in a Snapchat video in which he is shown studying on his iPad while doing a plank, in a tank top, at the gym. But he still is almost nowhere in the polls. On Tuesday he will have what could be his best chance to grab the kind of attention that could get his candidacy off the ground. The first Democratic presidential debate, held in Las Vegas and hosted by CNN, will give Mr. O’Malley, the opportunity to share a stage, and the spotlight, with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, who have marginalized him so far this year, leaving him with little in the way of media attention, voter support or donations. It is also the only one of the four Democratic debates scheduled for a weeknight — meaning viewership is not likely to increase at the others. Mr. O’Malley acknowledged this week that the debates would be “make or break.” “Right now, the people in my party, the only two candidates people have heard of are the inevitable front-runner and the senator from Vermont,” he told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. “So once the debates happen, people will be able to hear from all of the candidates.” A talented politician and forceful speaker with a long record of accomplishment, Mr. O’Malley, 52, began his campaign in May with a great deal of potential. He has assiduously courted Democratic activists and has delivered well-received speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, promoting his early advocacy for same-sex marriage in Maryland and his liberal views on immigration. History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. Yet his efforts have yielded little support. Mr. O’Malley’s polling average on the website Real Clear Politics stands at 0.7 percent. “People would pay big money if they could fix that problem,” said Kevin Geiken, an Iowa-based Democratic operative who is not committed to a candidate but praises Mr. O’Malley’s political talent and what he called his in-depth focus on issues. “It seems to be sort of a curious thing with him. His speeches are all received very enthusiastically. It seems like he’s doing the work in policy, he’s doing the work getting people excited — but it’s not showing up in the polls.” The same is true in New Hampshire. “I’ve seen him,” State Representative Steve Shurtleff, who is not yet supporting a candidate, said. “He was very good, and the crowd seemed to appreciate his remarks.” So why isn’t Mr. O’Malley attracting greater interest? “I really don’t know,” Mr. Shurtleff said. His allies say they expect him to gain attention later this year, when voters in the early primary states begin sharpening their preferences. Until then, Mr. O’Malley is trying to position himself to pick up support if there are major shifts in the race. He has also become overtly critical of Mrs. Clinton, after refraining from mentioning her name early on. And, showing flashes of outrage — or a toothy grin — he has lobbed verbal grenades at the Democratic National Committee, accusing it of scheduling the primary debates to aid Mrs. Clinton while starving her rivals of critical exposure. An effective attack dog, Mr. O’Malley was one of the few Democrats willing to publicly and frequently defend President Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign. But he may tone down the aggressiveness during Tuesday’s debate, his first appearance in front of a large national television audience, when voters are just getting to know him. Mr. O’Malley has made no secret of how he will portray himself as the most progressive alternative to Mrs. Clinton. On the campaign trail he blasts what he calls the lax regulation of Wall Street. He notes his support for gun control laws as governor of Maryland, his signing of a bill legalizing same-sex marriage that survived a referendum to overturn it, and Maryland’s enactment of in-state tuition rates for undocumented immigrants at state colleges and universities. He came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in April, although he appeared open to supporting it in 2013; Mrs. Clinton declared her opposition to the pact on Wednesday. And privately, Mr. O’Malley has described himself to voters who had clamored for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to run as the candidate who most shares her views. More recently on gun control, Mr. O’Malley has repeatedly called for reinstating the assault-weapons ban since the mass shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., which could give him an opening to attack both Mr. Sanders, who was friendly to the gun lobby in Vermont for years, and Mrs. Clinton, whose recollections in the 2008 presidential primary of being taught to shoot by her father prompted Senator Barack Obama to say, “She’s talking like she’s Annie Oakley!” At a taping of “Iowa Press,” Mr. O’Malley said, “Secretary Clinton can come on the show and answer for herself why she shifted her positions on so many issues over the course of these last few months.” Mrs. Clinton would have an easy response to just about any attack from Mr. O’Malley: He supported her in that 2008 contest, and wrote an op-ed essay in which he praised the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, of which he was once a member. “O’Malley was one of Senator Clinton’s strongest and most vociferous supporters in 2008 — a fact that I’m pretty sure is not lost on Hillary, who will have those quotes in her pocket on Tuesday night,” said David Axelrod, once Mr. Obama’s chief strategist. “It could make his task a little more complicated in drawing contrasts.” Mr. O’Malley could also face tough questioning about his time as mayor of Baltimore beginning in 1999, where he put in place the type of tough-on-crime practices that members of the Black Lives Matter movement say led to the use of excessive force by police officers. Mr. O’Malley’s campaign kickoff came weeks after the death of Freddie Gray, who died in April of a spinal cord injury while he was in Baltimore police custody, set off days of protests and looting. Mr. O’Malley’s luck has scarcely improved since. And, with Mr. Sanders the fiercer threat to Mrs. Clinton, the super PAC coordinating with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Correct the Record, no longer routinely sends a tracker to Mr. O’Malley’s events to record material to use against him. Yet he has not let up. Asked in Washington this week about his chances in Tuesday’s debate, he sounded decidedly upbeat. “I believe our country is looking for new leadership,” Mr. O’Malley told reporters, according to a transcript provided by his campaign. “We can’t be this dissatisfied with our national politics and our national economy, and resort to old names to break us out of this gridlock of inaction. America is looking for a new leader.” Advertisement"

          / AP WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are preparing a legislative push to curb guns, a week after a mass shooting at an Oregon community college refocused attention on the nation's toll of firearms deaths. Republicans controlling Congress have shown scant interest in restricting guns and the Democratic effort has little chance of success. But their drive could keep the issue alive during next year's elections and complicate Republican senators' re-election campaigns in some closely divided states. Democrats plan to eventually demand votes on their proposals and use procedural delays to thwart legislation if Republicans refuse to do so, a Democratic aide said Wednesday. The aide wasn't authorized to discuss the plans publicly and requested anonymity. Democrats said their effort would include broadening background checks, now required only for sales by federally licensed firearms dealers, to cover all sales at gun shows and online. A bipartisan version of that plan was blocked in 2013 by Republicans and a few Democrats, months after the fatal shooting of 20 students and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. They said they would propose making it harder for people to buy guns if their background check, which is run by the FBI, is not completed. Currently, if a background check is still not complete after three days -- often because the FBI is awaiting information from local law enforcement agencies -- the sale is allowed. Democrats said they would extend that period but didn't yet know for how long. They also said they would seek to add all domestic abusers to the list of those prohibited from purchasing firearms, and make it a federal offense to be a straw purchaser, or someone who buys a firearm for somebody else. The plans were described in a letter to Democratic senators written by Sens. Chuck Schumer and Debbie Stabenow, leaders of Senate Democrats' messaging efforts. A gunman killed nine people last week at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Authorities said Wednesday that the shooter, Christopher Harper-Mercer, killed himself in a room where many of his victims lay after he was wounded by plainclothes detectives. President Barack Obama plans to travel to Roseburg on Friday to meet with victims' families. As he has after several mass shootings, he has called on Congress to strengthen gun restrictions but expressed frustration with lawmakers' inaction.

http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/19/clinton-campaign-backs-off-candidates-support-for-australia-like-gun-confiscation-program-video/,"Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is backing off of the Democratic frontrunner’s recent support for a mandatory gun buyback program modeled on one instituted in Australia following a 1996 mass shooting. Asked during an interview on MSNBC Monday whether Clinton supports confiscating guns, Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri said “of course not.” “What she was referring to is places where there have been mass shootings and the countries have done something to act on it,” Palmieri told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “She has put forward a very common-sense proposal that would have background checks for everyone, that would remove the special protections the gun industry has from liability. But it’s all very common-sense measures the majority of the public supports.” During a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week, Clinton said that she thinks it a program like Australia’s is “worth considering.” “Communities have done that in our country,” Clinton said. “Several communities have done gun buyback programs, but I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level, if that could be arranged.” The National Rifle Association and other gun rights supporters jumped on Clinton’s remarks, pointing out that Australia’s gun buyback initiative was actually a gun confiscation program. Owners of a wide variety of guns were forced to sell their firearms to the government. (RELATED: Hillary Says She’d Consider A National Gun Buyback Program Like Australia’s) Asked if Clinton supports gun buyback programs in general, Palmieri said she does. “Yes. A number of cities do do that. It’s been effective,” Palmieri said.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/02/what-liberals-dont-want-to-admit-about-gun-control/,"This article is more than 1 year old Following the fatal shooting of nine people at a community college in southern Oregon last week, President Obama renewed his call for ""sufficient, common-sense gun-safety laws."" Yet there is only limited evidence that piecemeal regulation of the kind that policymakers in Washington and in state houses around the country are considering would substantially reduce gun fatalities. Take a prohibition on assault weapons, one of the most common proposals. The ban might make mass shootings less deadly, but most homicides are committed with handguns. A rule that owners must store their guns under lock and key -- if it were followed -- would help keep guns away from suicidal adolescents, but wouldn't protect adults in a violent domestic dispute. Requiring background checks for private sales and transfers would make it harder for convicted felons to buy guns secondhand, but some would still buy guns as a favor to brothers or boyfriends who wouldn't qualify themselves. Civilians in the United States already own more than enough guns to arm every American man, woman and child. Each of those weapons could end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. As a result, experts say, the main reason that guns cause the deaths of so many Americans is just that America has so many guns. And while most gun-control proposals aim to keep guns out of the wrong hands -- measures that could certainly save lives -- they do not generally address the sheer quantity of guns in this country. ""The big problem is the guns,"" said David Hemenway, a professor of public health at Harvard University. ""Guns are incredibly lethal,"" he said. ""It's easy to kill with a gun."" There aren't other ways to take a life that are equally effective. A knife wound is about eight times less likely, for instance, to take a life than a gunshot wound. A mandatory buy-back program, along the lines of Australia's highly successful ban on shotguns and semiautomatic and automatic rifles, could be effective in reducing the number of firearms. In Australia's case, a mass shooting at a tourist destination on the island of Tasmania led the country's conservative prime minister to require owners to sell their guns to the government in 1996. The government seized at least 650,000 guns -- about one in five guns in civilian hands at the time. The result was a reduction of nearly 80 percent in the rate of suicides by firearm. And the data suggest that Australians didn't simply use other methods besides guns to commit suicide. The policy likely saved hundreds of lives a year. [Read more: Did gun control work in Australia?]
Homicides by firearm also declined sharply, although since there were so few homicides in Australia before the ban, it is hard to know what to make of the data. Yet such broad programs aren't discussed in the current political climate in the United States. On Monday, Hillary Rodham Clinton laid out a plan to require buyers at gun shows to pass background checks. And Obama is considering similar measures, The Washington Post reported -- bypassing Congress through his executive authority as president to expand background checks into what are currently considered private sales. There is reason to believe that requiring background checks for all purchases -- not just for transactions at licensed retailers, as current law requires -- could prevent some firearms deaths, though it is not clear how many. ""The best we can do is say, 'The evidence is very suggestive, and it seems to make sense,' "" Hemenway said. Researchers have studied laws in Connecticut and Missouri requiring a purchaser to pass a background check and get a permit in order to buy guns privately. These laws prevented about a few dozen homicides a year, according to those studies. In the case of Connecticut, the law appeared to cause a substantial, 40 percent decline in the gun homicide rate, but again, in a small state with relatively few homicides to begin with, researchers need more information to determine whether the background checks would have a similar effect elsewhere. In Missouri's case, the change in the gun homicide rate was smaller, and it is unclear whether background checks reduce the rate of suicide. And shootings such as the one last week show that background checks sometimes aren't enough to avert violence. Authorities say Chris Harper Mercer had 13 guns and took six with him on his rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. He or members of his family reportedly acquired all of the weapons from retailers, meaning that they passed background checks. Adam Lanza, who authorities say shot and killed 26 at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, is said to have killed his mother before taking guns she had purchased. Maybe more thorough background checks, involving more than just a review of a buyer's criminal and medical records, could have prevented these killings, but it's hard to say. Dylann Roof, the young man who allegedly killed 9 people at a church in Charleston, S.C. in June, passed a background check despite his arrest on a narcotics charge. The arrest should have barred him from purchasing a weapon. No system of background checks will be perfect at capturing the rare person who sets out to kill many. That said, most gun related deaths a year aren't mass killings, but disputes involving one or two people that go wrong. So far this year, there have been fewer than 400 deaths in shootings in which four or more people were killed or wounded, and about 10,000 firearm homicides in total, according to organizations that monitor gun violence in the United States. Clinton's plan also calls for revoking the licenses of dealers who ""knowingly supply"" guns to the black market. It's difficult, though, for law enforcement to prove that a dealer knows who is buying his wares and to what end, said Jay Wachtel, a former agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who spent much of his career on the trail of gun traffickers in Los Angeles. [Read more: So far in 2015, we’ve had 274 days and 294 mass shootings] It is true that there are far fewer deaths involving guns in states with more restrictive rules on firearms, according to Hemenway and his colleagues, who thoroughly examined the issue in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2013. At the same time, there are also far fewer guns in those states to begin with. So it's hard to know what to make of the connection. The study noted that deaths involving firearms (including both suicides and homicides) were more than twice as common in the states with the most lax laws on guns compared to the states with the most stringent laws. Yet when adjusting for the number of guns -- along with demographic variables and the rate of violent deaths not involving firearms -- these two groups of states had identical rates of gun fatalities. It could be that where fewer people own firearms, more people are willing to support gun-control legislation. That legislation itself might not reduce the rate of fatalities, but because there are fewer guns, there are fewer deaths. In any case, as long as guns remain so prevalent in American life, it appears that violent shooting deaths will continue. Another shooting, this time on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, wounded three people and killed another Friday morning. ""The availability of firearms feeds this problem, but then, what the hell are you going to do about it?"" asked Wachtel, who now teaches criminal justice at California State University, Fullerton. Meaningful changes to the nation's firearms policy aren't politically feasible, he said: ""We're screwed.

http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/05/not-naming-the-oregon-shooter-helps-gun-control-enthusiasts/,"The horrific shooting of a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, has pushed America to look for answers. As what is too often the case for any mass shooting, many of America’s leaders have decided guns are ultimately responsible for the deaths of nine innocent people. At the same time, guns are getting the brunt of the blame. The actual shooter, Chris Harper-Mercer, is getting relatively little attention when compared to previous mass murderers. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, the chief local law enforcement official in Roseburg, has made it clear to reporters that they “will never hear me mention his [Harper-Mercer’s] name.” Hanlin’s said that his decision to not utter the shooter’s name is due to the sheriff’s desire to deny Harper-Mercer’s wish to gain fame through the slaughter. The Oregon sheriff does have a point in not wanting to give the killer more attention. From what has been revealed so far, Harper-Mercer had a marked interest in mass shooters like Vester Flannigan and Adam Lanza and could’ve been potentially been inspired to kill by such heinous acts. It also appears that the Roseburg shooter felt like he was a nobody who could only achieve notice through violence. So it’s a reasonable, and even commendable decision for Hanlin to not indulge the killer’s twisted wish. But it is not commendable for the media and political leaders to overlook the fact that a human being killed nine people, especially in light of the renewed calls for gun control. Refusing to discuss the shooter, his background and what drove him to kill in favor of hyperbolic talk on how dangerous guns are is asinine. The responsibility for this murder is being taken away from Harper-Mercer and placed on a disembodied gun that somehow wandered into the school on its own accord. Failing to scrutinize the man who pulled the trigger allows the conversation to center entirely on guns, which is exactly how President Obama and others want it to play out. Even though none of the proposed gun restrictions would have likely prevented the shooting, plus the massacre took place in a state with some of the most stringent restrictions on firearms in the country, those facts don’t matter. (RELATED: Obama: We Need More Gun Control) Before the public had known any concrete details of the shooting, Obama made a speech placing the blame squarely on guns and called for “common sense gun safety laws” in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Liberals have already set their sights on exploiting the shooting to try to push gun legislation — forgetting the man behind the trigger helps them in this task. It’s a great irony that the sheriff who’s largely responsible for calling upon the media to not focus on the shooter has publicly spoken out against gun control. The media framing also leads to this incredulous softball interview with Harper-Mercer’s father. The killer’s dad, Ian Mercer, abandoned his child at an early age and was by all accounts a terrible parent. But instead of accepting some blame for the tragic shooting or saying how his troubled son was ultimately responsible for the carnage, the elder Mercer said guns were the primary perpetrator and absolved his son of responsibility. (RELATED: Chris Mercer’s Dad Wants To Know Where He Got Those Guns) I guess guns have the power to possess humans, and Harper-Mercer had no agency when he kept pulling the trigger. This situation is very different from how the media treated the Charleston, S.C. church shooting back in June. Then, once it was realized that it was more politically favorable to blame “white America” and the Confederate flag for the murder of nine people, the media zeroed in on the killer and was happy to announce his name from sea to shining sea. Dylann Roof, somehow, was transformed into the living embodiment of every sin committed by white people throughout the centuries. His parents were not given softball interviews and were not able to deflect blame onto firearms. The reason why Roof got intense scrutiny is because his identification as a white supremacist made it easy to turn his crime into a cornucopia of left-wing advocacy. Harper-Mercer, on the other hand, appears to have no political affiliations and was raised by his African-American mother. So it’s hard to say he was a neo-Nazi or tea party extremist — except the media has already managed to imply the mixed-race shooter was somehow a white supremacist. The Los Angeles Times reported on Friday that Harper-Mercer had “white supremacy leanings” — whatever the hell that means. Several news outlets reported that his parting message was “full of hate,” a subtle allusion it was the kind of “hate” the left loves to associate with the right. If the public was made more aware of the killer’s background, these silly assertions would not be able to be passed off as fact. However right it may seem to not mention Harper-Mercer’s name, it comes at the price of understanding the situation and is an open invitation to the media to frame the shooting the way they want to frame it. And we wonder why the Roseburg narrative centers entirely around inanimate objects instead of the sick men who use them to kill innocent people.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harlan-green/australia-is-not-like-us_b_8269866.html?utm_hp_ref=world&ir=WorldPost,"Editor/Publisher ""Australia is not like the U.S."" said commentator Michael Pascoe in the Sydney Morning Herald in response to President Obama's remarks on the Umpqua Community College killings by a deranged killer, whose mother kept at least 8 guns at home, in addition to the 6 guns plus ammunition carried by the shooter in the slaughter of college students and a teacher. ""We know that other countries in response to one mass shooting have managed to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings,"" said President Obama. ""Friends of ours, allies of ours, Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours."" We happened to be in Australia while this happened, where the minimum wage for full-time, working adults is more than $16Aus per hour and Australian's have created a health care system that pays for all normal health care costs (as opposed to catastrophic events), though hospital care is free for every Australian citizen. In fact, the US now has a gun homicide rate 370 times that of Australia's. ""Unlike the US,"" said Pascoe, ""we collectively decided to have a decent social safety net, the concept of a living wage and make good education freely available. Most of us are wary of those with extreme views of any kind."" Our gun problem of course extends beyond mass violence, says the LA Times. In 2014 alone, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 11,208 people shot to death, 33,636 injured by gunfire and 21,175 who killed themselves with a gun. That's a total of 66,019 people who were killed or injured by a gun, which comes out to 1,269 per week, 180 a day or 7.5 per hour. Current Australian gun laws were passed after 35 were killed and 23 wounded in 1996. There hasn't been a mass shooting in Australia since. At the heart of the new laws was a massive buyback of more than 600,000 semi-automatic shotguns and rifles, or about one-fifth of all firearms in circulation in Australia. The country's new gun laws prohibited private sales, required that all weapons be individually registered to their owners, and required that gun buyers present a ""genuine reason"" for needing each weapon at the time of the purchase, as well as a 28-day waiting period while backgrounds were checked. (Self-defense did not count.) In the wake of the tragedy, polls showed public support for these measures at upwards of 90 percent. ""The US is too immature a society to be allowed to play with guns,"" said Pasco. ""It has never shed its Wild West mythology. Americans still use their courts to kill people, which sends a message in its own way."" What would cause the mother of the Umpqua college killer to have what can only be called a fanatical devotion to guns? ""I keep all my mags full. I keep two full mags in my Glock case. And the ARs & AKs all have loaded mags. No one will be 'dropping' by my house uninvited without (acknowledgment),"" the mother, wrote in her Tweety Bird tweet several years earlier, according to a CNN account. It has been known for years by those who research gun violence that more gun killings occur in households owning guns. A new survey in the Annals of Internal Medicine narrows down some of the causal relationship between guns and death by finding conclusively that having a gun in your home makes you more likely to successfully attempt suicide. The authors of the survey also found with a lesser degree of certainty that people with guns in their home are more likely to be the victims of a homicide. According to data gleaned from State and Justice departments for the period between 2001-2011, there have, in fact, been many, many more Americans killed by gun violence than by terrorism. During that 10-year period, some 130,347 have lost their lives to gun violence, compared to the approximately 3,000 Americans killed in acts of terrorism. ""It's all fodder for the deranged fanatics of the American gun lobby, with a bible in one hand and an assault rifle in the other. It's fuel for the paranoid interpretation of a line in the constitution that is a blatant anachronism."" We have to be a very sick society to have allowed this to happen. We are so good at preventing foreign terrorists from attacking us, but not protecting Americans from domestic terrorists. Then we should understand that gun violence itself is an act of terror. And those that support unrestricted use and purchase of guns are the sponsors of domestic terrorism. Harlan Green © 2015 Editor/Publisher Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oregon-shooter-plans-4chan_us_560da551e4b0768127016099,"Reporter, HuffPost A comment on the web bulletin board 4chan eerily warned of a school shooting in the Northwest on Wednesday, prompting speculation that the gunman responsible for Thursday's mass shooting  at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College may have indicated he was planning the deadly attack the day before. “Some of you guys are alright,” an anonymous commenter wrote on 4chan’s /r9k/ board at around 5 p.m. EDT. “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. Happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning. So long space robots.” Many 4chan users replied to the original poster -- known as “OP” in 4chan lingo -- with encouragement. “DO IT,” an anonymous commenter replied. Another commenter gave detailed advice: “I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire.” The “OP” responded with gratitude and announced that he would be live-messaging his actions again on Thursday morning. “Thanks fam,” he offered. In response to the detailed instructions, he said, “Thanks. Keep me in your prayers.” It is not clear how seriously to take any of these comments. The threads, some excerpted below, contain explicit, often confrontational, language. 4chan users are known to joke about violence and other dark topics. They often pride themselves on being social misfits who can vent their frustration on the online platform. But the coincidental timing and specific nature of the message make it, as well as the comment thread, worth sharing. 4chan removed the comment thread from its site. 4chan’s rules forbid discussions or images that violate U.S. law. The site’s content moderators can remove posts or block users that they believe have violated the rules, but 4chan also regularly “prunes” old threads from the site. 4chan’s press office did not immediately respond to a request to confirm that it had removed the thread for violating the message board’s rules. There is no evidence of the new comment thread the user promised to post on Thursday morning. Authorities also appear to be unconvinced that the messages portended the attack. Law enforcement sources say they are skeptical that postings on 4chan regarding a shooting are connected to what happened today in Oregon. It is nearly impossible to confirm the identity of a 4chan user, since they have anonymity by default. They can choose a username if they want, but it is typically not a real name. In addition, only the site administrators know the user’s IP address. And even then, a skilled computer user could use a fake IP address. But it would not be unheard of for law enforcement to use 4chan content to identify or prosecute a murderer. Oregon police arrested David Kalac for murdering his girlfriend in November 2014, after Kalac posted photos of her on 4chan and implied that he would soon be shot and killed by police. Twitter users drew attention to the thread on Thursday as possible evidence of a warning from the shooter. Looks like the Oregon college shooter warned of his attack on 4chan's /r9k/ board the day before

 https://t.co/twnJ0DJV6s pic.twitter.com/eVCmqDjcfZ The news media soon followed up on the leads, asking notoriously insular and acerbic 4chan users for help identifying the murderer -- but they were, predictably, having none of it. 4chan users seemed to make the connection between the comment thread, however, continuing to respond to the original comment on an archived version of the thread on Thursday. They expressed surprise that the foretold attack had occurred. And their comments, whether sincere or intended as jokes, were mostly positive. “GOOD SHOW OP / MAY YOU RIP IN PEACE,” one anonymous commenter wrote. “THIS IS DAY A HISTORY REEEE,” a user named MC RIDE said. Below is an image of the moment on Thursday when users began to connect the thread with the shooting: Also on HuffPost: Reporter, HuffPost"
