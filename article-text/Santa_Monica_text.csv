Goh will remain at Napa State Hospital until doctors determine he is mentally fit to stand trial. A new progress report on his mental status will be presented to the court in December. Goh could face the death penalty for the alleged mass shooting last year in which he is accused if using a .45-caliber handgun to kill six Oikos University students and a receptionist because the school refused to refund his tuition.

It was a rare instance of a gun rampage in China, where few civilians own firearms. On Saturday, the employee, identified by only his last name, Fan, is said to have used a tool from the chemical plant where he had worked to fatally beat a colleague, and then grabbed a hunting rifle hidden in the factory’s living quarters, the Shanghai Bureau of Public Security said on its Web site. Mr. Fan got into a private vehicle — the statement did not specify what kind — and killed the driver, and then a soldier who was guarding an army barracks. Mr. Fan returned to the factory and killed three more people. Four people were injured. Police officers who had gone to investigate the initial killing at the factory caught Mr. Fan there near midnight. The episode was rare and alarming enough to prompt the national Ministry of Public Security to convene an emergency video meeting and demand a nationwide check on the availability of firearms. China is not immune to crimes of violent rage, despite the sweeping powers wielded by the police. But few civilians have permits to own firearms, and shooting rampages are rare. Meng Jianzhu, the secretary of the Communist Party committee that runs the legal and police apparatus, and Guo Shengkun, the minister of public security, issued orders for the case to be promptly investigated and to “resolutely strike hard against violent criminal activities that seriously menace public safety, ensuring overall social stability,” the Ministry of Public Security said on its Web site. The official statements did not give details about the business dispute involving Mr. Fan, who is in his early 60s. One former employee at the chemical factory said Mr. Fan was embroiled in a conflict with the owner, according the Xinmin Evening News, a newspaper in Shanghai. Advertisement"

The package, which includes 23 executive actions announced by President Obama earlier this year, is intended to bolster the nation’s database used for background checks and make it harder for criminals and people with mental illnesses to get guns. Among other things, the executive orders relax health care privacy regulations that some state executives say prevent them from putting the names of those Americans with mental health records into the database. The orders also give states more money to help them add data to the system and compel federal agencies to share more mental health data on workers. The goal is to add thousands of new people into the database — those with a history of mental illness, for example — who would not legally be allowed to buy a gun under current law. Gun control groups said that they admired the efforts, but that they would never carry the weight of legislation to expand the number of gun buyers who are subjected to the background check system. “Everything they have done helps,” said Mark Glaze, the director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “They are important and significant and will make a big difference, but the biggest reduction in gun violence will come when every American gets a background check.” This week, families from Newtown visited Capitol Hill to press for new legislation, while B. Todd Jones, Mr. Obama’s choice to head the embattled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, endured a testy nomination hearing. “We’ve only just finished round one in our fight to get Congress to pass common-sense measures to save lives, and we will continue to join 90 percent of Americans in calling on them to close loopholes in the background check system,” Denis McDonough, Mr. Obama’s White House chief of staff, said Wednesday in an e-mail. “But in the meantime, we are doing everything in our power without them — including strengthening the existing background check system.” The administration’s progress enrages some Republicans and the National Rifle Association, which has aggressively fought any changes to gun laws. “The reason President Obama is using executive actions is to circumvent the will of the people and to bypass Congressional oversight,” said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the group. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS, is a database made up of law enforcement, mental health and other records maintained by the F.B.I. to screen out prohibited firearms purchasers, including people with a record of felonies, those with active domestic violence protection orders lodged against them or those who have been involuntarily committed. The background check database contains more than 10 million active records, but states have been lax in some cases about uploading records to the system, particularly ones related to mental health. Without an act of Congress, the administration is unable to significantly expand the number of gun buyers who are subject to background checks, nor curb certain types of weapons and clips, both central to Mr. Obama’s gun agenda. Those efforts failed in April on the Senate floor and have yet to be revived. The executive orders also direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin research into gun violence, which administration officials and gun control groups say will help make the case for new gun safety regulations. During the gun debate this past spring on Capitol Hill, there was little available data about the reasons for gun violence, buying patterns and other gun-related public health issues. The reason is that Congress, under pressure from the gun lobby in the 1990s, redirected money that had been allocated for gun research by the C.D.C. and wrote legislation that was interpreted as a ban on government-financed studies of gun violence. The Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit organization, released a 69-page report this month that recommended research on the characteristics of firearm violence, preventive strategies, gun safety technology and the role of video games and other popular media on gun violence. The Centers for Disease Control is now moving to study some of these areas. Gun control groups say that the administration’s actions are the closest thing they have to rolling back two decades of an expansion in gun rights in both state legislatures and on Capitol Hill. “The simple act of saying we are no longer going to prohibit agencies from doing basic research on what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands and kill people is a sea change,” Mr. Glaze said. He also said that states had responded well when they had been given the resources and historically tended to respond well when they faced the risk of losing scarce funds. “There are a lot of people who are not in the system who should be,” Mr. Glaze said. Administration officials say that a few states, like Pennsylvania, have already started to increase entries in the database. “As a group these efforts work in tandem,” said Sarah Bianchi, the director of economic and domestic policy for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “But among the most important was expanding the background check system. There are different reasons some states don’t send all their records: resources, confusion about the law. We wanted to do everything we could to strengthen the system.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, expressed dismay at the recent developments. “President Obama abused his power by imposing his administration’s policies through executive action instead of working with Congress and allowing the issue to be debated,” he said. “As a strong defender of the Second Amendment, I will continue to oppose the president’s attempts to undermine Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms.” Next week Mr. Biden will speak to gun groups, his first public event on gun control since the failure of the Senate bill.

Liveblog: Debate on privacy in a digital world. Timothy B. Lee in The Washington Post.

Investigators would like to lodge some charge against him quickly, even under seal, which could prevent Mr. Snowden from traveling easily. But there are incentives to proceed slowly with extradition cases."" Devlin Barrett in The Wall Street Journal. The strange politics of spying. ""What may be just as significant is the way in which attitudes toward the security state could split voters and elected officials within each party — possibly creating a wedge issue in both party primaries in 2016. Politicians who are normally associated with being on the far left and the far right may find common cause with grass-roots voters in their objection to domestic surveillance programs, fighting against a party establishment that is inclined to support them."" Nate Silver in The New York Times. @kjhealy: You know, we could interpret the appalling quality of most online comments as a kind of social immune system response to NSA surveillance.

Rand Paul can take on the NSA. ""Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has pledged to spearhead a class-action lawsuit against the NSA on behalf of the millions of Americans whose phone and Internet activity logs have been vacuumed up under sweeping Patriot Act orders for “business records.” Yet the NSA program’s defenders insist it’s entirely legal -- that the Constitution doesn’t even protect these records, making any court challenge a nonstarter. The terrifying thing is they may be right, which means we need to seriously rethink how the Fourth Amendment works in the 21st century."" Julian Sanchez in Bloomberg. NOLAN: The vain media cynics of surveillance. ""[T]he cynics on this story reside in the ultra-establishment. They are the journalists and pundits who feel compelled to demonstrate their own sophistication by dismissing these revelations as old hat (though documented proof of these programs has never been seen before). They are those who have grown so inured to the gross overreach of government power that they can no longer conceive of it as scandalous. They prefer to comfort the NSA, and afflict the leaker."" Hamilton Nolan in Gawker. SIMON: Is this an issue or is it not? ""The U.S. government has two contradictory responses to the leaks. First, it says, the stuff Snowden has leaked is no big deal and the media are guilty of “hyperbole” in their reporting on it."" Roger Simon in Politico. FOURNIER: The dirty secrets of Washington elites. ""There must be a way to shed a modicum of light on how far Presidents Bush and Obama stretched the Patriot Act. Surely, it's possible to start an open and honest conversation about drone warfare, domestic surveillance, and big data in general terms that don't expose cherished ""sources and methods."""" Ron Fournier in NationalJournal. SHAFER: The selective leak. ""Without defending Snowden for breaking his vow to safeguard secrets, he’s only done in the macro what the national security establishment does in the micro every day of the week to manage, manipulate and influence ongoing policy debates. Keeping the policy leak separate from the heretic leak is crucial to understanding how these stories play out in the press..Secrets are sacrosanct in Washington until officials find political expediency in either declassifying them or leaking them selectively. It doesn’t really matter which modern presidential administration you decide to scrutinize for this behavior, as all of them are guilty."" Jack Shafer in Reuters. IRWIN: Moore’s Law, J. Edgar Hoover and the real roots of the NSA surveillance scandal. ""When Moore’s Law was conceived, and J. Edgar Hoover was at the height of his power running the FBI, a world in which the government could plausibly suck in all the data created by hundreds of millions of Americans or billions of earthlings was simply beyond imagining. (Well, not completely beyond imagining. George Orwell did a quite good job)."" Neil Irwin in The Washington Post. CROOK: Is the U.S. still the 'land of the free'? ""I’m mainly struck by the weaknesses of the constitutional checks and balances that one thinks of as quintessentially American -- so often, they seem to be failing where they’re needed most. There’s a pattern here, and you don’t need to be an NSA data-miner to see it...Obama is right that there’s a trade-off, and most Americans seem to be happy, as I am, to accept some modest invasion of their privacy in return for more effective protection against terrorism. But that can’t mean carte blanche."" Clive Crook in Bloomberg. SARGENT: The right 'balance' on the NSA. ""Is there a way to continue giving the government the surveillance tools it says it needs to ensure national security, even as we do a better job safeguarding Americans’ civil liberties? Here, with the help of Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel for the ACLU, are steps that could be taken to mitigate current government overreach."" Greg Sargent in The Washington Post. FRIEDMAN: Blowing a whistle. ""Yes, I worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another 9/11 — abuse that, so far, does not appear to have happened. But I worry even more about another 9/11. That is, I worry about something that’s already happened once — that was staggeringly costly — and that terrorists aspire to repeat. I worry about that even more, not because I don’t care about civil liberties, but because what I cherish most about America is our open society, and I believe that if there is one more 9/11 — or worse, an attack involving nuclear material — it could lead to the end of the open society as we know it."" Thomas L. Friedman in The New York Times. ROSENTHAL: Clapper lied. ""On March 12, James Clapper, director of national intelligence, testified at an open congressional hearing. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked him whether the National Security Agency collects “any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.” His answer: “No sir.” Then he added: “Not wittingly.” It was a lie, as everyone now knows from the articles about the N.S.A.’s data-mining program."" Andrew Rosenthal in The New York Times. DAVIDSON: Should contractors be doing national-security work? ""In an attempt to clarify what inherently governmental means, the Office of Management and Budget issued guidance in 2011 that said: “The FAIR [Federal Activities Inventory Reform] Act defines an activity as inherently governmental when it is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by Federal employees.” Federal employee unions have long argued too many contractors are doing work meeting that definition."" Joe Davidson in The Washington Post.

A state spokesman said the gunmen arrived before dawn riding motorbikes. They climbed over a hill that overlooks Kizara village and randomly opened fire before going house-to-house, attacking residents. The attack lasted more than five hours and some of the gunmen positioned on the hill also shot at residents of neighboring villages who tried to help those in Kizara. ""I woke up in the morning to get my children set for work on my farm. I suddenly started to hear gun shots. I listened attentively and I realized that sounds of the gun shots were coming directly behind me,"" said Alhaji Ali Hakimi, who survived the attack. More from GlobalPost: Nigeria violence kills nearly 200 as government's Boko Haram Committee talks peace ""I then sensed trouble and quickly ran into my house. I saw one of my children standing at the compound and I told him to hide himself in a room close to mine but before he did that they came and shot him dead."" The mass shooting has been dubbed a revenge attack after the villagers had formed vigilante groups to try to end a string of violent thefts. The gunmen searched for suspected members of the groups and shot them and their families. Among the dead is the chief imam, as well as a man believed to be the head of a vigilante group. Africa's most populous country and biggest oil producer, Nigeria has also been battling an insurgency of Islamist militants, although the latest attack is not believed to be linked to the other violence.

Last week, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg sent a letter to hundreds of the biggest Democratic donors in New York, urging them to refrain from giving money to the four Democratic senators who voted against a bill that would have expanded background checks on gun purchases. But interviews with a number of these top Democratic givers reveal that like some other Bloombergian initiatives—soda bans, bikes shares, and breast-feeding mandates, to name a few—this directive is being met with some skepticism. “His heart is in the right place, and I have respect for his values, but his political judgments are just wrong,” said Victor Kovner, who, along with his wife, Sarah, has been a regular contributor to Democratic causes for decades. “He has little experience in politics. He has experience running the city and running as a billionaire for office, and running the city well, but by reason of his limited political background, he has been mostly focused on the merits [of the gun legislation] and not on the politics.” The gun control bill, named after West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, would have required that all gun purchases be subject to a background check. (Current law exempts guns sold by private dealers and at gun shows.) Bloomberg has been a longtime proponent of stricter gun laws, founding Mayors for Illegal Guns in 2006, but the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, late last year precipitated a furious lobbying push by him and other gun control advocates. In the end, it was not enough. Four Democrats—Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota—joined all but four Republicans to ensure the bill’s defeat. All four of the Democrats hail from swing states and are expected to face tough reelection fights that would be crucial for Democrats to win if they hope to hold on to their slender majority in the Senate. Both Begich and Pryor are up for reelection in 2014; Heitkamp isn’t up until in 2018. After the vote, Baucus announced his retirement. Most political analysts put the odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate at about even. A number of donors who spoke to The Daily Beast expressed disappointment in the vote of the four senators, but thought the chances of getting even the most modest kind of gun legislation passed would be brought to zero if Mitch McConnell led a GOP majority in the Senate after November. “It took me a long time to figure this out, but it actually matters a lot which party has more members in the Senate,” said Sally Minard, one of the top Democratic fundraisers in New York. “It is just critical that Democrats take back the House and control the Senate.” Bloomberg’s efforts are not entirely alone. Kenneth Lerer, chairman of BuzzFeed, and David Bohnett, a technology entrepreneur in Los Angeles, have both said they are withholding contributions to Democrats who aren’t right on the issue. And former White House chief of staff Bill Daley wrote a Washington Post op-ed urging his fellow Democrats not to  give to Heitkamp and the others. But it is one thing to hear from Bill Daley, who hails from one of the most prominent Democratic families in the country, and another to hear from Mike Bloomberg on the matter. New York’s top Democratic donors are some of the city’s titans in real estate, finance, and law, exactly the kind of community that the billionaire media mogul turned mayor moves easily in. But some bristled at suggestions on political giving put forth by an independent who was three times elected mayor of New York as a Republican and who has regularly donated to Republicans around the country, including to some with shaky records on gun control. “As much as you are not happy with the way [the four] voted, do we really want to jeopardize the Senate majority in states where it is already jeopardized?” asked one top New York donor, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing the mayor. “God forbid we lose this.” It was a letter, some noted, that could have easily been endorsed by the likes of Karl Rove and other Republican operatives who would like nothing more than to see marginal Democrats starved of campaign funds. “If the mayor didn’t send his letter to Republicans also,” said Kovner. “Then it wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on.” Gun control advocates have long strategized around ways to defeat the immense power of the National Rifle Association, which has used a scorecard and a checkbook to keep lawmakers in line. Other gun control groups, however, have traditionally preferred a far less confrontational approach than Bloomberg is taking, and top Democratic officials noted that none have officially lined up behind his letter. Ladd Everitt, the director of communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said that his group largely supported what the mayor was doing, and that they did not endorse the letter because “we were not asked to.” “If the NRA has chips in the game, we want to have chips in the game too, and a way to pressure people who are not voting on principle is to deny them chips,” he said. “We have reached the point where we have these insane gun laws precisely because we have been too afraid to go after our ‘friends.’ If we had taken a harder line on this maybe we wouldn’t be in this situation.” And a number of Democratic donors who spoke to The Daily Beast said they supported what the mayor was doing. “It is not about advocating for their defeat. But if a public official is going to cast a vote that is going to endanger the welfare and the lives of New Yorkers and citizens throughout this country, we are going to hold them accountable,” said Robert Zimmerman, a major Democratic donor in New York. “Look at Chuck Schumer. He has been a role model and a hero when it comes to gun safety, and we have a right to elect senators of a similar caliber.” It remains unclear how much of an effect all of this campaign-fund withholding will have in the end. Heitkamp doesn’t face the voters for five and half more years. Begich recently had a New York fundraiser canceled, but the host insisted it was due to scheduling and not to the mayor’s letter. Last month, Bill Clinton hosted a fundraiser for Pryor. “Our fundraising has been pretty good. I haven’t seen any change in any of that at all,” said Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager. “We haven’t had donors turn us down because of what the mayor wrote. We are continuing to fundraise as we always have.” Instead of withholding funds and encouraging others to do the same, top Democratic donors suggested that there were other ways to change the conversation around gun control. Some suggested that the money would be better spent rewarding those Democrats and Republicans who took tough votes in favor of the measure. Or defeating some of the vulnerable Republicans in the House who do not support gun control. If the House flipped back to Democratic control because of the gun issue, this thinking goes, it would send a message to GOPers around the country. And others noted that the four took votes that they thought would reward them politically in their home states; instead of punishing them, better to educate voters in each of those states around the dangers of gun violence. “It would be wonderful if we were able to give Democrats who were afraid to vote for it some kind of cover,” said Minard. She said advocates needed to do more old-fashioned arm-twisting in order to get their way. “I mean, we have all seen the movie Lincoln, haven’t we?”"

The setting was the same, but the political dynamics far different than they were five months ago when Biden and President Obama used the same auditorium to propose the most expansive overhaul of the nation’s gun laws in generations. They hoped to prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and to require that every gun buyer undergo a background check. But with their agenda blocked on Capitol Hill, Biden acknowledged that the progress report on the administration’s actions — he said 21 of 23 executive actions rolled out in January have been nearly completed — would not be enough to make serious headway in the fight against gun violence. “As proud as the president and I am of progress we’ve made, we need Congress to act,” Biden said, speaking to an audience that included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. “We need everyone in the country to know the fight is not over. Far from it. . . . I assure you one thing each of us says to our colleagues about the votes: ‘The country has changed. You will pay a political price for not getting engaged and dealing with gun safety.’ ” Gun-control advocates described the administrative actions as baby steps that would do relatively little to prevent the next mass shooting. “What can be accomplished through executive action is real and necessary, but not sufficient,” said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “If all that comes out of this once-in-a-generation debate is teaching kids how to duck and cover during a mass shooting, some members of Congress are going to have a lot to explain when it happens. And it will happen,” added Glaze, whose group is financed and led by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). In the weeks since the Senate blocked the administration’s gun proposals in mid-April — including a background-check compromise that polls showed 90 percent of Americans supported — Obama and Biden have rarely mentioned gun violence. With his speech Tuesday, though, Biden renewed the call for universal background checks and reminded the public that gun control remains on the administration’s agenda despite the defeat. “Because of the invocation of a rule, a perverted filibuster rule requiring 60 votes for everything, we lost,” Biden said of the Senate vote on universal background checks. Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December, he said, “more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. And Iraq. That’s no way to run a country. The country knows it. They know we can do something about it.” National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the White House is sidestepping Congress and “the will of the people” with its unilateral executive actions. “It is clear that the reason the White House is resorting to doing executive actions and administrative actions is because they are trying to bypass the will of the people and circumvent Congress,” he said. The executive actions were the product of Biden’s task force, which reviewed ways to stem gun violence after the Newtown massacre, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. Several of the actions were bureaucratic steps designed to strengthen the existing background-check system, including making federal agencies provide relevant criminal records and improving incentives for states to share information with the system. Other steps could help empower law enforcement, including enhancing data to trace firearms and allowing police to run background checks on released suspects before returning seized guns to them. In addition, Obama has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes and prevention of gun crimes, including links between video games, media images and violence, officials said. Biden held up several documents, which he described as detailed emergency management plans that would help communities and schools prepare for mass shootings or attacks. “I personally was getting calls from around the country: ‘Joe, what do we do if anything remotely similar to what happened at Sandy Hook happens in our community?’ ” Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group founded by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), pointed to new laws in some states, such as Delaware and Colorado, which have toughened firearm restrictions. “There’s a lot that can be done to make our communities safer, some of which can be done at the executive level and some of which can be done at the legislative level,” Carusone said. “In the absence of any federal action legislatively, there’s been a lot of good work that’s been done at the state level.” White House aides and gun-control advocates hope the Senate will reconsider the measure this summer or fall. But a senior administration official would not disclose whether any progress had been made on the legislative front since the April vote, or detail any conversations Obama, Biden or other White House officials may have had with key senators. Biden was introduced Tuesday by Stephen Barton, who was struck twice during the mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last year. “If you want reason for optimism, you’re looking at it,” Biden said of Barton. Turning to him, the vice president said, “I look forward to working with you and finishing the job.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Declaring that “we have not given up,” Vice President Biden warned Tuesday that lawmakers who opposed the Obama administration’s proposals to stem gun violence “will pay a political price.” Biden appeared in a White House auditorium to announce that the administration has completed or made significant progress on nearly two dozen smaller-scale executive actions aimed at strengthening existing background checks, improving record-keeping, and providing schools and communities with emergency management plans.

The Judiciary Committee finally held a confirmation hearing for B. Todd Jones, the part-time acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who also serves as the U.S. attorney for Minnesota. ATF has not had a full-time director in seven years; President Obama nominated Jones to head the agency five months ago as part of his guns initiative after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. The confirmation hearing came the same week that gun-control advocates, including parents of children killed in Newtown, are pushing lawmakers to reconsider Obama’s stalled legislative package, particularly the bill expanding background checks for firearm purchases. Senate Democratic aides said there are no imminent plans to revive the bill or other elements. Prospects for Jones also appeared dim as the crowded hearing got off to a fiery start. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), the committee’s ranking Republican, criticized Jones on several fronts, including over an inquiry into a controversial civil case involving the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota, a harsh letter about Jones’s leadership from a former FBI official in the state, and allegations by a whistleblower assistant U.S. attorney that Jones took actions against him. “Why are we even here today?” Grassley asked rhetorically. “There are allegations of gross mismanagement and abuse of authority in Mr. Jones’s office, and there is a complaint that Mr. Jones retaliated against a whistleblower.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) defended Todd’s tenure in Minnesota and as acting ATF director, citing letters of support from police chiefs and other law enforcement officials across the country. “Something is wrong when the Senate fails to confirm the head of an agency for seven years,” Klobuchar said. “Something is wrong when we have ATF agents, over 2,000 of them, on the front lines of major investigations like the Boston Marathon bombing. While victims lay dismembered in the hospital, the agents were on the front line figuring out who did it and what happened. And yet the Senate still will not confirm a permanent leader of this agency.” Law was changed in 2006 to require the head of ATF to be confirmed by the Senate. Attempts to win approval for other nominees have failed, and Jones appears headed for a wait, too. The ghost of Operation “Fast and Furious,” the botched effort to track guns from U.S. deals to Mexican drug traffickers, hung over the hearing. Jones was not at ATF during Fast and Furious; he was brought in 15 months ago as acting director to help reform the embattled agency. But there was no escaping the lingering controversy. “Was anyone disciplined?” asked Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), pressing Jones to name ATF officials who were demoted or terminated after a report this fall by the Justice Department’s inspector general that said federal agents ignored risks in the gun-tracking operation. Jones, who said ATF “was very much in distress” when he arrived, told Flake that several employees have been disciplined. He said privacy rules prohibit him from providing details, but he acknowledged that William McMahon, the deputy assistant ATF director who oversaw the Western region during the operation, had been “terminated.” Democrats rose to Jones’s defense. “You’ve had a long, distinguished career,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.). “You were passed unanimously for U.S. attorney by this committee a few years ago. And now, it’s taken a long time to get your nomination approved by this committee and by the Senate.” For his part, Jones, a former Marine, maintained his composure and even his humor. At one point, he mistakenly called Grassley “your honor.” “This is like a courtroom,” Jones said, smiling. “I feel like a defendant.” “As a farmer, I feel honored,” Grassley replied.

Wonkbook's Quotation of the Day: “No sir.” That, of course, was Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper's answer to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden, who asked whether Clapper's agency, the National Security Agency, operated any wide data-collection program -- a question that would have fit the telephone-metadata collection program, or PRISM, exactly.

They only begin with the facts that the programs at issue are highly classified and that Mr. Snowden is now a hunted man, potentially facing a prison sentence for disclosing the very secrets that started the discussion that Mr. Obama welcomed."" Scott Shane and Jonathan Weisman in The New York Times. ...But that hasn't stopped some pushback. ""The challenge to the secrecy surrounding the NSA's activities stands in contrast to the reaction in Washington, where forces including the White House and senior members of both parties in Congress have rallied behind the status quo, saying the programs strike a balance between protecting privacy rights and combating terrorism."" Evan Perez in The Wall Street Journal. Liveblog: Debate on privacy in a digital world. Timothy B. Lee in The Washington Post. Americans say leaks didn't hurt national security. ""A new CBS News poll shows just 30 percent of Americans think Snowden’s leaks have weakened national security, while 60 percent say his disclosures either have no effect or will strengthen national security."" Aaron Blake in The Washington Post. Tech giants want to reveal data requests. ""Google, Facebook and Microsoft on Tuesday asked the government for permission to reveal details about the classified requests they receive for the personal information of foreign users...[T]he companies say they are frustrated that they are unable, because of a government gag order, to give more details of sharing user data with the government."" Claire Cain Miller in The New York Times. @StephenAtHome: If you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide from the giant surveillance apparatus the government's been hiding. ...And about 500,000 private contractors have access to top-secret info. ""Clearance doesn’t mean all these workers get to see every classified document out there. And, as various analysts have pointed out, Snowden likely would have needed even higher clearance than “top secret” to gain access to PRISM and other surveillance programs. (One former NSA official told the Post that “maybe 30 or maybe 40″ people would have access to the secret court orders that Snowden leaked.)"" Brad Plumer in The Washington Post. Senators ask NSA to declassify more information. ""The Senate Intelligence Committee is asking the director of the National Security Agency to declassify some pieces of information in order to better explain how the agency uses telephone and Internet intercept programs revealed in recent news reports to thwart terrorist attacks."" Ed O'Keefe in The Washington Post. @RameshPonnuru: Snowden may not make good arguments against this surveillance program, but he is a good argument against this surveillance program. NSA chief briefs senators. ""Gen.

It's scary, period. Hackers vs. suits: why nerds become leakers. ""Laptops with EFF or Tor stickers are common at technology conferences, and people who have them tend to have a lot in common. They tend to be technically-savvy, skeptical of authority, and comfortable defying social conventions. Like Snowden, a high school dropout, they tend to have unconventional career paths."" Timothy B. Lee in The Washington Post. Prosecutors develop extradition strategy for Snowden. ""The investigation of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has become a legal game of cat and mouse, as federal prosecutors weigh what criminal charges would help bring him back to the U.S...Several U.S. officials described competing interests as they prepare a criminal case against Mr. Snowden. Investigators would like to lodge some charge against him quickly, even under seal, which could prevent Mr. Snowden from traveling easily. But there are incentives to proceed slowly with extradition cases."" Devlin Barrett in The Wall Street Journal. The strange politics of spying. ""What may be just as significant is the way in which attitudes toward the security state could split voters and elected officials within each party — possibly creating a wedge issue in both party primaries in 2016. Politicians who are normally associated with being on the far left and the far right may find common cause with grass-roots voters in their objection to domestic surveillance programs, fighting against a party establishment that is inclined to support them."" Nate Silver in The New York Times. @kjhealy: You know, we could interpret the appalling quality of most online comments as a kind of social immune system response to NSA surveillance. NSA opinion roundup: SANCHEZ: How Sen. Rand Paul can take on the NSA. ""Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has pledged to spearhead a class-action lawsuit against the NSA on behalf of the millions of Americans whose phone and Internet activity logs have been vacuumed up under sweeping Patriot Act orders for “business records.” Yet the NSA program’s defenders insist it’s entirely legal -- that the Constitution doesn’t even protect these records, making any court challenge a nonstarter. The terrifying thing is they may be right, which means we need to seriously rethink how the Fourth Amendment works in the 21st century."" Julian Sanchez in Bloomberg. NOLAN: The vain media cynics of surveillance. ""[T]he cynics on this story reside in the ultra-establishment. They are the journalists and pundits who feel compelled to demonstrate their own sophistication by dismissing these revelations as old hat (though documented proof of these programs has never been seen before). They are those who have grown so inured to the gross overreach of government power that they can no longer conceive of it as scandalous. They prefer to comfort the NSA, and afflict the leaker."" Hamilton Nolan in Gawker. SIMON: Is this an issue or is it not? ""The U.S. government has two contradictory responses to the leaks. First, it says, the stuff Snowden has leaked is no big deal and the media are guilty of “hyperbole” in their reporting on it."" Roger Simon in Politico. FOURNIER: The dirty secrets of Washington elites. ""There must be a way to shed a modicum of light on how far Presidents Bush and Obama stretched the Patriot Act. Surely, it's possible to start an open and honest conversation about drone warfare, domestic surveillance, and big data in general terms that don't expose cherished ""sources and methods."""" Ron Fournier in NationalJournal. SHAFER: The selective leak. ""Without defending Snowden for breaking his vow to safeguard secrets, he’s only done in the macro what the national security establishment does in the micro every day of the week to manage, manipulate and influence ongoing policy debates. Keeping the policy leak separate from the heretic leak is crucial to understanding how these stories play out in the press..Secrets are sacrosanct in Washington until officials find political expediency in either declassifying them or leaking them selectively. It doesn’t really matter which modern presidential administration you decide to scrutinize for this behavior, as all of them are guilty."" Jack Shafer in Reuters. IRWIN: Moore’s Law, J. Edgar Hoover and the real roots of the NSA surveillance scandal. ""When Moore’s Law was conceived, and J. Edgar Hoover was at the height of his power running the FBI, a world in which the government could plausibly suck in all the data created by hundreds of millions of Americans or billions of earthlings was simply beyond imagining. (Well, not completely beyond imagining. George Orwell did a quite good job)."" Neil Irwin in The Washington Post. CROOK: Is the U.S. still the 'land of the free'? ""I’m mainly struck by the weaknesses of the constitutional checks and balances that one thinks of as quintessentially American -- so often, they seem to be failing where they’re needed most. There’s a pattern here, and you don’t need to be an NSA data-miner to see it...Obama is right that there’s a trade-off, and most Americans seem to be happy, as I am, to accept some modest invasion of their privacy in return for more effective protection against terrorism. But that can’t mean carte blanche."" Clive Crook in Bloomberg. SARGENT: The right 'balance' on the NSA. ""Is there a way to continue giving the government the surveillance tools it says it needs to ensure national security, even as we do a better job safeguarding Americans’ civil liberties? Here, with the help of Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel for the ACLU, are steps that could be taken to mitigate current government overreach."" Greg Sargent in The Washington Post. FRIEDMAN: Blowing a whistle. ""Yes, I worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another 9/11 — abuse that, so far, does not appear to have happened. But I worry even more about another 9/11. That is, I worry about something that’s already happened once — that was staggeringly costly — and that terrorists aspire to repeat. I worry about that even more, not because I don’t care about civil liberties, but because what I cherish most about America is our open society, and I believe that if there is one more 9/11 — or worse, an attack involving nuclear material — it could lead to the end of the open society as we know it."" Thomas L. Friedman in The New York Times. ROSENTHAL: Clapper lied. ""On March 12, James Clapper, director of national intelligence, testified at an open congressional hearing. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked him whether the National Security Agency collects “any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.” His answer: “No sir.” Then he added: “Not wittingly.” It was a lie, as everyone now knows from the articles about the N.S.A.’s data-mining program."" Andrew Rosenthal in The New York Times. DAVIDSON: Should contractors be doing national-security work? ""In an attempt to clarify what inherently governmental means, the Office of Management and Budget issued guidance in 2011 that said: “The FAIR [Federal Activities Inventory Reform] Act defines an activity as inherently governmental when it is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by Federal employees.” Federal employee unions have long argued too many contractors are doing work meeting that definition."" Joe Davidson in The Washington Post.

PORTER: Health care's overlooked cost factor. ""[A]n elephant in the room appears to have been overlooked in the debate over how to rein in the galloping cost of health care: a lack of competition in what is now America’s biggest business — accounting for almost 18 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product...The share of metropolitan areas with highly concentrated hospital markets, by the standards of antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, rose to 77 percent from 63 percent over the period."" Eduardo Porter in The New York Times. SOLTAS: The U.S. economy still isn't churning. ""The rate of labor market ""churn"" -- the number of people moving from job to job per quarter -- dropped by 2.3 million during the recession and hasn't recovered...Low churn means that people may be choosing to hold down jobs that aren't quite right for them. The average job change produces a $1,000 productivity gain, according to Lazear and Spletzer, who found a total cost of $208 billion since 2008."" Evan Soltas in Bloomberg. COHN: You call this insurance? ""[T]o engage in this debate, all of the trade-offs should be clear. And that includes the ones Taylor declined to highlight.

The setting was the same, but the political dynamics far different than they were five months ago when Biden and President Obama used the same auditorium to propose the most expansive overhaul of the nation’s gun laws in generations. They hoped to prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and to require that every gun buyer undergo a background check. But with their agenda blocked on Capitol Hill, Biden acknowledged that the progress report on the administration’s actions — he said 21 of 23 executive actions rolled out in January have been nearly completed — would not be enough to make serious headway in the fight against gun violence. “As proud as the president and I am of progress we’ve made, we need Congress to act,” Biden said, speaking to an audience that included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. “We need everyone in the country to know the fight is not over. Far from it. . . . I assure you one thing each of us says to our colleagues about the votes: ‘The country has changed. You will pay a political price for not getting engaged and dealing with gun safety.’ ” Gun-control advocates described the administrative actions as baby steps that would do relatively little to prevent the next mass shooting. “What can be accomplished through executive action is real and necessary, but not sufficient,” said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “If all that comes out of this once-in-a-generation debate is teaching kids how to duck and cover during a mass shooting, some members of Congress are going to have a lot to explain when it happens. And it will happen,” added Glaze, whose group is financed and led by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). In the weeks since the Senate blocked the administration’s gun proposals in mid-April — including a background-check compromise that polls showed 90 percent of Americans supported — Obama and Biden have rarely mentioned gun violence. With his speech Tuesday, though, Biden renewed the call for universal background checks and reminded the public that gun control remains on the administration’s agenda despite the defeat. “Because of the invocation of a rule, a perverted filibuster rule requiring 60 votes for everything, we lost,” Biden said of the Senate vote on universal background checks. Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December, he said, “more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. And Iraq. That’s no way to run a country. The country knows it. They know we can do something about it.” National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the White House is sidestepping Congress and “the will of the people” with its unilateral executive actions. “It is clear that the reason the White House is resorting to doing executive actions and administrative actions is because they are trying to bypass the will of the people and circumvent Congress,” he said. The executive actions were the product of Biden’s task force, which reviewed ways to stem gun violence after the Newtown massacre, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. Several of the actions were bureaucratic steps designed to strengthen the existing background-check system, including making federal agencies provide relevant criminal records and improving incentives for states to share information with the system. Other steps could help empower law enforcement, including enhancing data to trace firearms and allowing police to run background checks on released suspects before returning seized guns to them. In addition, Obama has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes and prevention of gun crimes, including links between video games, media images and violence, officials said. Biden held up several documents, which he described as detailed emergency management plans that would help communities and schools prepare for mass shootings or attacks. “I personally was getting calls from around the country: ‘Joe, what do we do if anything remotely similar to what happened at Sandy Hook happens in our community?’ ” Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group founded by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), pointed to new laws in some states, such as Delaware and Colorado, which have toughened firearm restrictions. “There’s a lot that can be done to make our communities safer, some of which can be done at the executive level and some of which can be done at the legislative level,” Carusone said. “In the absence of any federal action legislatively, there’s been a lot of good work that’s been done at the state level.” White House aides and gun-control advocates hope the Senate will reconsider the measure this summer or fall. But a senior administration official would not disclose whether any progress had been made on the legislative front since the April vote, or detail any conversations Obama, Biden or other White House officials may have had with key senators. Biden was introduced Tuesday by Stephen Barton, who was struck twice during the mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last year. “If you want reason for optimism, you’re looking at it,” Biden said of Barton.

The setting was the same, but the political dynamics far different than they were five months ago when Biden and President Obama used the same auditorium to propose the most expansive overhaul of the nation’s gun laws in generations. They hoped to prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and to require that every gun buyer undergo a background check. But with their agenda blocked on Capitol Hill, Biden acknowledged that the progress report on the administration’s actions — he said 21 of 23 executive actions rolled out in January have been nearly completed — would not be enough to make serious headway in the fight against gun violence. “As proud as the president and I am of progress we’ve made, we need Congress to act,” Biden said, speaking to an audience that included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. “We need everyone in the country to know the fight is not over. Far from it. . . . I assure you one thing each of us says to our colleagues about the votes: ‘The country has changed. You will pay a political price for not getting engaged and dealing with gun safety.’ ” Gun-control advocates described the administrative actions as baby steps that would do relatively little to prevent the next mass shooting. “What can be accomplished through executive action is real and necessary, but not sufficient,” said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “If all that comes out of this once-in-a-generation debate is teaching kids how to duck and cover during a mass shooting, some members of Congress are going to have a lot to explain when it happens. And it will happen,” added Glaze, whose group is financed and led by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). In the weeks since the Senate blocked the administration’s gun proposals in mid-April — including a background-check compromise that polls showed 90 percent of Americans supported — Obama and Biden have rarely mentioned gun violence. With his speech Tuesday, though, Biden renewed the call for universal background checks and reminded the public that gun control remains on the administration’s agenda despite the defeat. “Because of the invocation of a rule, a perverted filibuster rule requiring 60 votes for everything, we lost,” Biden said of the Senate vote on universal background checks. Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December, he said, “more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. And Iraq. That’s no way to run a country. The country knows it. They know we can do something about it.” National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the White House is sidestepping Congress and “the will of the people” with its unilateral executive actions. “It is clear that the reason the White House is resorting to doing executive actions and administrative actions is because they are trying to bypass the will of the people and circumvent Congress,” he said. The executive actions were the product of Biden’s task force, which reviewed ways to stem gun violence after the Newtown massacre, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. Several of the actions were bureaucratic steps designed to strengthen the existing background-check system, including making federal agencies provide relevant criminal records and improving incentives for states to share information with the system. Other steps could help empower law enforcement, including enhancing data to trace firearms and allowing police to run background checks on released suspects before returning seized guns to them. In addition, Obama has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes and prevention of gun crimes, including links between video games, media images and violence, officials said. Biden held up several documents, which he described as detailed emergency management plans that would help communities and schools prepare for mass shootings or attacks. “I personally was getting calls from around the country: ‘Joe, what do we do if anything remotely similar to what happened at Sandy Hook happens in our community?’ ” Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group founded by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), pointed to new laws in some states, such as Delaware and Colorado, which have toughened firearm restrictions. “There’s a lot that can be done to make our communities safer, some of which can be done at the executive level and some of which can be done at the legislative level,” Carusone said. “In the absence of any federal action legislatively, there’s been a lot of good work that’s been done at the state level.” White House aides and gun-control advocates hope the Senate will reconsider the measure this summer or fall. But a senior administration official would not disclose whether any progress had been made on the legislative front since the April vote, or detail any conversations Obama, Biden or other White House officials may have had with key senators. Biden was introduced Tuesday by Stephen Barton, who was struck twice during the mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last year. “If you want reason for optimism, you’re looking at it,” Biden said of Barton.

Authorities have not named the gunman who was killed by police. But law enforcement sources in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles identified him as John Zawahri, 23. Several of the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Zawahri had struggled with his parents' bitter divorce. He also had a history of mental issues, the sources said, but they could not be more specific. Santa Monica police said Saturday that the department had dealt with the gunman in connection with an incident in 2006 but would not provide details because he was a juvenile at the time. Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks also said officers had previously gone to the home where the rampage began. Just before noon Friday, the home was set on fire, and authorities found the gunman's father, Samir Zawahri, 55, and brother, Chris, 25, dead, sources said. Police said the rampage lasted about 10 minutes, with the gunman cutting a sharp, bloody path through normally quiet streets. It ended when Zawahri, who'd been firing a semiautomatic rifle, was shot on the campus. ""Any time someone puts on a vest of some sort, comes out with a bag full of loaded magazines ... has a handgun and has a semiautomatic rifle, carjacks folks, goes to a college, kills more people and has to be killed at the hands of police,"" Seabrooks said, ""that's premeditated."" A close friend of the family, who asked not to be identified, said that John struggled with mental health problems. Details on the gunman and his victims weren't available Saturday, partly because the shooter's mother, identified by the sources as Randa Abdou, was said to be out of the country and had not been reached by police. John Zawahri's parents had been divorced for years, neighbors said. Court records show two divorce filings. One was filed in 1993, by Samir Zawahri. Another, noting domestic violence, was filed by Abdou in 1998. The family moved into a Santa Monica home on Yorkshire Avenue about two decades ago, neighbors said. After the couple split up, Abdou eventually settled into an apartment about 2 miles away with son Chris. John had remained with his father. Police are still searching for what may have caused the rampage. Seabrooks said the gunman would have turned 24 Saturday."

Lanza might have been inspired by the ESL shooting and other massacres.

We've received your submission. Newtown gunman Adam Lanza feverishly edited Wikipedia entries about mass shootings and tried to find ways to turn semiautomatic guns into fully automatic killing machines, according to a new report. The online habits of the then 17-year-old Lanza are being examined after authorities in Connecticut linked Lanza to a user name that posted on a gun message board, in gaming chat rooms and made edits to Wikipedia, The Hartford Courant revealed. Showing off impressive technical knowledge of both computers and guns, the user thought to be Lanza also revealed in a post that he had a “fetish” for .32 ACP bullets. Gun-obsessed Lanza slaughtered 20 first-graders and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012 before killing himself with a shot to the head from a Glock handgun. Prior to arriving at the school, 20-year-old Lanza shot his mother Nancy four times in the head. Now state investigators have linked the deranged mass killer to a number of Wikipedia edits and gun message board posts made between April 2009 and February 2010 related to firearms and mass killings, The Courant reported. In one October 2009 post on a gun message board, Lanza allegedly asks whether Connecticut’s ban on certain semiautomatic pistols would be extended to other weapons, with another user replying that Lanza should contact the police. “I always prefer asking through proxy when I can avoid speaking to someone directly,” Lanza wrote back, “I was just wondering if anyone knew because I have a fetish for .32 ACP [bullets].” After revealing his bullet fetish, Lanza returned to the same site in April of 2009 to learn how to modify firearms to make them fully automatic. “In Connecticut, fully automatic firearms are legal to own but selective fire is prohibited,” starts one post. “I vaguely recall reading … about a company which alters them to fire exclusively automatically (or something in that vein), but I don’t know how that process works. For example, with whom would I correspond to modify a Title II M2 Carbine that is currently in another state to fire fully automatically before it is sent to Connecticut?” The Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle Lanza fired 154 times at Sandy Hook is in the same family of guns as the Title II M2 Carbine he asked about in the message board post. Both guns are related to the M16 rifle used by the US military. During the same 2009 to 2010 time period, Lanza obsessively combed through 12 Wikipedia entries about mass shootings around the world, according to the Courant. In one revision made to the Wiki about the September 13, 2006 shooting at Dawson College in Montreal where one student was killed and 19 others injured, the user thought to be Lanza testily described the gun the shooter used. “‘9mm’ was listed as ‘.9mm.’ People say that 9mm is anemic, but this is ridiculous,” Lanza supposedly wrote explaining his edit. The same user also spent time revising the Wiki entries about both the October 1991 massacre at Luby’s cafeteria in Killeen, Texas when 23 were killed and 20 injured and the Wiki about the 1988 massacre at ESL Inc., in Sunnyvale, California. Lanza supposedly edited the ESL entry four times in February 2010. Wearing ear plugs and a vest with over 1,000 rounds of ammunition on it, ESL shooter Richard Farley shot through the glass door of the California software company before gunning down seven people and injuring four more. Twenty years later, Lanza would shoot his way through the glass front windows at Sandy Hook wearing ear plugs and carrying hundreds of round of ammo on a military-style vest.  Share Selection"

Six people were killed in a shooting rampage, and the shooter was killed by police. (Associated Press) The nation faces the shock of another mass shooting, Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks described a violent shooting rampage that appears to have begun just before noon, according to the Los Angeles Times. In addiction to killing four, the gunman The shooting was a short distance from where President Obama was attending a private fund-raising lunch before heading to Palm Springs for a meeting with the president of China. The gunman, who was not immediately identified, was described as white or Latino with curly hair and 20 to 30 years old, according to USA Today. He reportedly was wearing body armor and a helmet. He was reportedly carrying a military-style assault rifle, a shotgun, a handgun and an ammunition belt. CBS News said that Seabrooks told reporters the rampage began at a house in the California coastal city before the gunman made his way to Santa Monica College. Seabrooks said the gunman killed two people in the house, which caught fire. ""The officers came in and directly engaged the suspect and he was shot and killed on the scene,"" Seabrooks said. Three other women went to UCLA Medical Center Santa Monica with relatively minor injuries, Morgan said. One has shrapnel-type injuries and the two others had injuries not related to gunfire, he said.

Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more in an Aurora movie theater. He will wear the harness, which will be anchored to the floor,  because of the violent nature of his alleged crimes, a judge said. Judge Carlos Samour Jr. will send out 5,000 jury summons and expects at least 3,200 people will end up in court, he ruled on Thursday. That would mean each of the 450,000 Arapahoe County residents eligible for jury duty would have a 1 in 90 chance of being called, for this one case alone, court spokesman Rob McCallum told CNN. The idea is to bring in 800 prospective jurors at a time on Thursdays and Fridays early next year, a process that McCallum says could take three to four weeks. Those thousands will be winnowed down to 12 men and women for the start of the trial, which is set to begin February 3. It is expected to last four months. Judge accepts theater shooting suspect's insanity plea Asking more people than usual to come to court for high-profile cases is common in the U.S. justice system, given concerns many of them already know the story and have strong opinions about it. In Florida, for example, there was a 500-person jury pool for the now-ongoing murder trial of George Zimmerman, who is accused in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin -- a case that drew national headlines for weeks. So too, of course, did what happened just after midnight the night of July 20, 2012, in the Denver suburb of Aurora. It was then and there, authorities say, that a man walked through an exit door into a crowded Theater 9 of the Century movie complex as a late-night premiere of the Batman sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises"" played. The former neuroscience graduate student wore all-black, a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector, and a gas mask, police say. And he carried an arsenal that included two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Steve Beggs has testified. ""He didn't care who he killed,"" prosecutor Karen Pearson told a judge during a preliminary court hearing in January, adding Holmes chose his venue carefully to cage his victims. ""He intended to kill them all."" After the carnage and Holmes' subsequent capture outside the theater, he was charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons violations. Rescue workers weren't prepared for chaos of Aurora shooting Since his arrest, much of the in-court discussion has resolved around Holmes' mental state. Judge Samour earlier this month accepted the defense's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. He was then taken to the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo for evaluation, and is expected to be back in Arapahoe County Jail on August 2. Prosecutors in Arapahoe County announced in April they would seek the death penalty. Despite the notoriety of the mass shooting, the judge ruled Thursday that the empaneled jury will not be sequestered, as Holmes' defense team requested. Making it so they couldn't go home throughout the prolonged trial, Samour said,  was an ""unnecessarily drastic, expensive and impractical remedy that ... will create an extreme and undue hardship for jurors."" The judge also ruled against the defense's attempt to prevent jurors from using phones or computers, barring their use in court but saying preventing them from using them outside is ""unreasonable and unfair."" One thing jurors won't be able to see is restraints on Holmes. As someone accused of ""multiple violent crimes,"" Samour says that Holmes must be restrained carefully during his trial. But the judge said he needn't wear handcuffs or shackles. Instead, the judge ruled, Holmes will ""wear a harness under his clothing which will not be visible to the jury"" and will be anchored to the floor."

By REID J. EPSTEIN 06/18/2013 06:44 PM EDT Updated 06/19/2013 10:45 AM EDT Vice President Joe Biden insisted to a subdued audience Tuesday that he and President Barack Obama “haven’t given up” on gun control. But his remarks came at the first White House event since the Senate’s failed April 17 background checks vote. And all that he had to show gun control supporters by way of progress was a list of completed or mostly completed executive actions — and a set of new guidebooks for churches and schools on how to deal with a mass shooting situation. Over the past two months, the White House has dramatically dialed back its gun push. ( PHOTOS: Politicians speak out on gun control) Biden chief of staff Bruce Reed’s Friday White House strategy meetings for representatives of gun control groups ended weeks ago. The barnstorming tour Biden pledged would pressure senators who voted against background checks hasn’t materialized. No new sponsors or votes for the background check bill have emerged publicly. Neither has any sort of timeline for when Congress might take up the measure again. “I had hoped we would have assembled in this auditorium earlier,” Biden said. “I had hoped we would have assembled here a couple of months ago celebrating the first in a number of victories that we will have.” ( PHOTOS: Stars call for gun control) So Biden conceded the obvious Tuesday: the White House gun push in Congress has faltered. Instead, Biden claimed a partial victory based on what he described as an evolution in the mood of the country. More voters, he said, are willing to punish members of Congress who oppose gun control measures. ( PHOTOS: Politicians with guns) “I assure you, the one thing that each of us have been saying to our colleagues about these votes is the country has changed,” Biden said. “You will pay a price, a political price, for not, for not getting engaged and dealing with gun safety.” Yet Tuesday’s event illustrated how the White House and the gun control groups with which it has worked closely since January have grown apart: The groups received no briefing before the White House unveiled its report to the press on Monday. The White House’s public silence over the last two months has essentially ceded the issue to these outside groups. “I don’t know how much there is for [the White House] to do,” said a representative from one of the groups that had been meeting with Reed. “The president doesn’t twist arms and have lunch, there’s no money to put a post office or a research facility in somebody’s district. What do you do other than travel places — and now they don’t even travel.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said after Biden’s speech that the White House now has less influence on senators than the gun control groups do. “The five or six senators who are going to move our way aren’t going to do so because of pressure from the White House,” Murphy said. “They’re going to do so because of political pressure from outside groups who have millions of dollars to spend against them.” Yet Murphy said it will still be necessary for Obama and Biden to speak more about gun control. “The White House should be talking about this every chance that they get,” he said. “I’m not disappointed in the level of interest, but if I could have the president and vice president talking about gun violence every day, I’d be happy.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), overhearing Murphy’s remarks, added: “And outside of Washington, it shouldn’t be in the Executive Office Building, it ought to be out there.” Without action from the White House and with little happening in Congress, gun control groups spent the last week trying to manufacture events to keep the cause in the public spotlight. To mark six months since the Newtown massacre, Sandy Hook Promise has brought Newtown family members to the Capitol to lobby House members this week. Mayors Against Illegal Guns is launching a bus tour “to persuade Senators to take a second look at the background check bill they failed to pass this spring.” And Obama’s political arm, Organizing for Action, hosted a series of local events Friday, with mixed results. One Wisconsin chapter advertised a “chalk body flash mob” on the sidewalk four floors below Sen. Ron Johnson’s Milwaukee office. A rally in San Bernadino, Calif., drew only three supporters, according to the San Bernadino Sun. “If all that comes out of this once-in-a-generation debate is teaching kids how to duck and cover during a mass shooting, some members of Congress are going to have a lot to explain when it happens,” said Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mike Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “And it will happen.” The gun control picture in the Senate is at best the same as it was before the background checks vote. The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) has been temporarily replaced by Republican Jeff Chiesa, who hasn’t taken a public stance on the background checks deal brokered by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Chiesa has yet to be lobbied on the gun issue by Manchin, Toomey or any other senators, an aide said Tuesday. There’s almost no hope of winning red-state Senate Democrats like Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who opposed the background checks bill proposed by Manchin and Toomey. Pryor, considered the most vulnerable Democrat up for re-election next year, launched his first re-election TV ad by boasting that he opposed the gun control proposal. Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), targets of more than $1 million of negative ads, have seen their approval ratings drop. Biden, as he has before, cited the polls as evidence the nation has turned against senators who opposed background checks. “I will not mention names, but look at those who voted no, and look at what their poll results are in their states immediately after voting no,” Biden said. “Many who were popular and were in the 50s and 60s now find their favorable ratings in the 40s.” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) asked Manchin for a briefing last week on the status of his proposal, but has no intention of bringing up the measure for another vote unless there is a dramatic boost in its support, said Democratic senators and aides. Like Biden, who said senators who voted against background checks have asked him to “find a way for us to revisit this,” Blumenthal said he remains optimistic that 60 votes will materialize to support expanded background checks. But he said there is no way to measure progress. “This is not like, you know, a yardstick where you can say, ‘Well, it’s this far along on the yardstick.’ There’s no metric here for percentage measurement,” Blumenthal said. “We’re not going to ask someone, ‘Are you there yet?’ unless they actually are. We’re not going to take a count until we get 60.” - John Bresnahan contributed reporting Missing out on the latest scoops?

Jan. 15, 2013: Accessories manufacturer Kevin Kao, of Irvine, Calif., examines a military grade Remington ACR Special Purpose Rifle at the 35th annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas. (AP) MADISON, Wis. – Wisconsin police would be forbidden from enforcing any new federal gun and ammunition restrictions, bans or registration requirements under a bill a Republican lawmaker is circulating. Rep. Michael Schraa of Oshkosh, a first-term legislator and a member of the National Rifle Association, sent out an email Tuesday to his fellow lawmakers seeking co-sponsors for the proposal. He also issued a statement to the media saying the bill is meant to send a message that Wisconsin won't help the federal government restrict the public's constitutional right to bear arms. ""I'm not this cowboy, gun-toting legislator,"" Schraa said in a telephone interview. ""I just think it's ultimately important to protect our constitutional rights. When I raised my right hand on Jan. 7 and took the oath of office, I took an oath that I would defend the Wisconsin Constitution and the federal constitution. That's the motivating factor."" Rep. Chris Danou, D-Trempealeau, said he thought the Civil War determined that federal law pre-empts state law. ""States don't get to pick and choose what federal laws apply to the states or not,"" Danou said. ""This is settled law. (The bill is) just not rational."" The bill comes after President Obama introduced a gun control plan in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December. The president's proposal included banning assault-style rifles and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and extending background checks to almost all gun sales. The plan ultimately died in the Senate, but the president has urged supporters to pressure Congress to reconsider the issues. Under Schraa's bill, a state or local law enforcement officer would be prohibited from enforcing any federal act, law, rule, regulation or order enacted after Jan. 1, 2013, that bans or restricts semi-automatic weapons, assault weapons or magazines; requires people to register their guns, ammunitions or other firearm accessories; regulates magazine capacities or how much ammunition a person can possess; prohibits types of ammunition; or requires people to turn their weapons into the government. Any police officer who knowingly enforces any of those federal statutes or orders would be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and nine months in jail. The measure also would specify that guns manufactured in Wisconsin and stamped ""Made in Wisconsin"" haven't traveled across state lines and aren't subject to the federal interstate commerce clause. Some gun advocates fear the federal government could argue the commerce clause gives it the ability to regulate weapon movements within a state; eight other states have adopted similar provisions, according to the Council of State Governments. The proposal would ban doctors from asking patients about whether they own guns when gathering their medical history. Schraa said he included the prohibition because the federal health care overhaul doesn't ban such communication. ""It just doesn't make any sense,"" Schraa said. ""It's an intrusion in our privacy and I don't think there's any place for it."" United In Freedom, a group that supports conservative candidates, and Wisconsin Gun Rights, a gun rights advocacy group, have organized a rally for the bill in Madison on Saturday. Charles Brey, president of United in Freedom, said the legislation is about ""correcting federal overreach."" ""If you look at what's been coming out of (Washington), D.C., in recent months, it's more like active resistance. They've been striking at us,"" Brey said. ""We need to make sure it's clearly enumerated where we stand and where we draw the line as a state."" Donald Downs, a political science and law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the federal government can't compel state and local officials to assist in enforcing federal law. But states and their citizens are subject to constitutional federal laws, including statutes stemming from the commerce law, he said. ""For the state to pass a law that says outright, 'We're not going to abide by a federal law,' is pretty extreme,"" Downs said. ""The best thing is, if you don't like it, just go to court."" Sheboygan Falls Police Chief Steve Riffel, president of the Wisconsin Chiefs of Police Association, didn't immediately return telephone and email messages seeking comment on the bill late Tuesday afternoon. The bill's prospects are unclear. Schraa set the deadline for co-sponsors to sign on for Friday, June 21. Republicans control the Assembly and Senate, but both houses are consumed with passing the state budget before lawmakers recess for the summer. GOP leaders were noncommittal. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington, said he hadn't seen the bill's exact language yet. A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, said he also hasn't had a chance to review the measure.

According to a BuzzFeed report, a Reddit user claiming to be an employee of the Aurora theater where 12 died and 70 were injured last summer during a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" hosted an Ask Me Anything chat. Asked whether the theater had built a memorial to the victims of the shooting, the user named Rorschachismyhubby replied that there isn't and expressed a a wish to have one. We get crap for this alot (sic), the mayor asked us not to as he wanted to handle it as a community event and not a commercial business' memorial. Besides, the company would have to buy the land to put the memorial on, making it not a public space. So no we don't :( ... I would like one because I feel like right now it seems like we are trying to pretend like it never happened. Alot of people come in simply to pay respects and all I can do is show them the fancy new chairs we used to replace the ones people had died in. Rorschachismyhubby also claimed to be working on the night of the shooting but said she was clocking out and was getting into her car as the 911 calls were coming in. Six months after the shooting, Cinemark reopened the theater and renamed individual theaters with letters rather than numbers. The theater where suspected gunman James Holmes opened fire has been renamed Theater I and has been turned into an ""XD"" or an ""extreme digital cinema"" with a screen that stretches wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling. Though a decision on a permanent memorial has not yet been announced, Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan had said that reopening the theater would be ""part of the recovery process"" and said the Aurora community had expressed support in reopening it. Some 5,000 potential jurors are expected to get a summons for Holmes' trial which is expected to begin in February."

Todd Jones of  Minnesota, President Barack Obama's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 11, 2013, before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination. Five months after President Barack Obama called on lawmakers to approve his choice to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Senate is considering the nomination.   (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON — It was remarkable enough that President Barack Obama’s choice to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives got a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. Only one other nominee to lead the ATF has had a hearing, and none has been confirmed.
But then, hardly any senators showed up to grill B. Todd Jones, making the appearance all the more surreal and, perhaps, indicating that he faced the same likely fate as his predecessors: limbo.
The Senate has been authorized to approve the agency’s leader since 2006 but has never done so. As a result, the bureau charged with enforcing the nation’s patchwork of gun laws has had only interim chiefs for the past seven years.
The gun lobby has worked aggressively and successfully behind the scenes to persuade lawmakers to forgo the hearings — and the confirmations. Michael Sullivan is the only other nominee to make it as far as Jones. 


A U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Jones is the current acting ATF director and, like others before him, has split his time between two jobs.
His nomination followed a mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed in December. It was one of several mass shootings around the country in recent years that pushed both Obama and some lawmakers to call for increased gun control. So far, those efforts have failed.
That was the backdrop to Tuesday’s hearing.
At times, Jones supporters greatly outnumbered the senators who popped in and out of Tuesday’s hearing — some for just a few minutes and most hardly long enough to ask a question. The two exceptions were Charles Grassley of Iowa, the panel’s top Republican, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat.
The process was on both of their minds. 


Grassley complained early and often that Tuesday’s confirmation hearing was premature, saying there were still outstanding questions Jones needed to answer.
“Why are we even here today?” Grassley asked after outlining a series of concerns he had about Jones’ work as a U.S. attorney in Minnesota. The senator also wanted to know what, if anything, Jones may know about the agency’s widely criticized Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting operation.
Jones said he had not seen the details of the internal complaints about his Minnesota work and couldn’t comment on them. And he said he came to the ATF after the gun-smuggling sting and has since replaced special agents in charge in 22 of the 25 field divisions.
Klobuchar led the Democratic inquiry in place of committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont. She spent much of the morning clarifying that Jones took over the agency after the gun-smuggling scandal was revealed, and she repeatedly criticized her Senate colleagues for failing to confirm an ATF director.
“That’s wrong. Something is wrong when the Senate fails to confirm the head of an agency for seven years,” Klobuchar said. “It seems that some members of the Senate don’t want to (give) the ATF the benefit of a director.”
Jones, for his part, told the sparse panel that the ATF was “in distress” when he took the acting director job in 2011.
“There had been a lack of strong visionary leadership, and of accountability and attention to detail,” Jones said.

Bloomberg is asking big-money donors to withhold contributions to Democratic senators who voted against stricter gun-control laws. New York Mayor Michael I. Bloomberg. (Seth Wenig/AP) Bloomberg is sending a letter to more than 1,000 top New York-area campaign donors on Wednesday specifically urging them not to contribute to four Senate Democrats -- Max Baucus (Mont.), Mark Begich (Alaska), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) -- who voted against a bipartisan gun bill that failed to advance in the Senate. By asking campaign donors to withhold funds, the mayor -- who also has deep pockets -- is going against the will of his congressional Democratic allies who tried, but failed to advance gun legislation in April and have warned that increased public criticism of vulnerable Democratic lawmakers could lead to Republican gains. The Senate failed to advance a bipartisan bill that would have expanded the national gun background check system in April, when supporters fell short of the 60 votes necessary to proceed to final debate. In the weeks since, Bloomberg's anti-gun group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars targeting several senators of both parties for voting against the measure. ""Instead of rising above politics to pass a law that would save lives,"" Bloomberg, a political independent, wrote, the four senators ""sided with a gun lobby increasingly out of touch with Americans' priorities."" ""The next time these four senators want you to support them with donations to their campaigns, tell them you cannot,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""Until they show that they will stand up for the American people and not the gun lobby, tell them you cannot support their candidacy."" Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and is responsible for promoting Democratic gains during next year's midterm elections, defended his colleagues against Bloomberg's efforts Wednesday morning by calling the Democratic senators ""very strong candidates."" But he stopped short of criticizing Bloomberg directly. ""Mayor Bloomberg is entitled to make choices he wants to make, he obviously feels very strongly about this issue and he has for a long time and I’m not going to make a judgment about that. He’s entitled to do what he feels he needs to do,"" Bennet said at a breakfast meeting hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Begich and Pryor face difficult races next year, while Heitkamp is a freshman and wouldn't face reelection until 2018. Baucus has announced plans to retire. A spokesman for Begich declined to comment, while a Heitkamp spokesman said the senator would have no comment. A Baucus spokeswoman said that ""the only thing that ever influences Senator Baucus' policy decisions is what's right for Montana and what he hears from his constituents back home. Campaign contributions have never and will never influence Senator Baucus' decisions on any legislation."" Pryor is trying to use Bloomberg's criticisms to his advantage by airing a campaign ad that highlights his opposition to the gun bill. “The mayor of New York City is running ads against me because I opposed President Obama’s gun-control legislation,” Pryor says in the ad. He later adds that ""no one from New York or Washington tells me what to do; I listen to Arkansas.” But John Feinblatt, Bloomberg's chief policy adviser in New York, struck back sharply at Pryor's tactics Wednesday morning. ""I think that certainly when senators push back and say they’re not going to take directions from New York, they ought to stop the hypocrisy, because they clearly like to listen to New Yorkers when it comes time to scoop up their donations,"" Feinblatt told reporters on a conference call. ""They ought to address what’s on the minds of voters and constituents and explain why they chose to take a vote that was in direct conflict with the people they represent."" Bloomberg's personal appeal to campaign donors comes as several parents of some of the youngest victims of gun violence are scheduled to meet this week with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Parents of children killed during the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. last December plan to meet Wednesday with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.), the lead sponsor of the defeated gun bill, and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). Read Bloomberg's complete letter to donors below: On April 17, four Democrats joined with most Senate Republicans in voting ""no"" on the Manchin-Toomey background checks compromise, legislation that would have strengthened public safety by tightening loopholes in our current gun laws that allow felons and the dangerously mentally ill to get guns without passing a background check. Instead of rising above politics to pass a law that would save lives, these four Senators—Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Mark Pryor of Arkansas—sided with a gun lobby increasingly out of touch with Americans' priorities. I am writing to ask you: the next time these four Senators want you to support them with donations to their campaigns, tell them you cannot. Until they show that they will stand up for the American people and not the gun lobby, tell them you cannot support their candidacy. These ""no"" votes were a slap in the face to Americans everywhere. Polls consistently show that 90% of Americans—including 82% of gun owners and 74% of NRA members—support requiring background checks for all gun sales so that illegal guns do not fall into the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. But instead of standing up for what's right, and for a common-sense measure their constituents support, these Senators made a calculated vote designed to pander to the gun lobby in anticipation of their next election. When confronted with a tough vote, we expect our leaders to show courage and support the interests of the American people—and many of them did. The background checks compromise was fashioned by two NRA ""A""-rated Senators, Joe Manchin (D) of West Virginia and Pat Toomey (R) of Pennsylvania, who bridged the partisan divide crippling the Senate to offer bipartisan legislation that strengthens the federal background check system. Most Senators, including Senators from states with strong traditions of gun ownership, rose to the occasion by supporting the Manchin-Toomey compromise. They understand that closing loopholes that make it easy for felons to buy guns will not weaken gun rights one bit. But the background checks compromise still fell short of the 60 votes it needed to pass. Senators Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp, and Pryor sided with the minority, reminding us of why so many people are angry at Congress. Astonishingly, the four Senators did this even as they ask New Yorkers, who contributed a significant share of the funding for their last election bids, to donate to them once again. Their votes were an affront to the nation. Make no mistake: loopholes at the federal level undermine our efforts to keep our streets safe. By voting against background checks, these Senators told us they would rather bow down to a special interest group than support a common-sense measure to help law enforcement fight gun crime. Now you can tell these Senators: by voting against background checks, they voted against your values and your family's safety. And until they show they will stop bowing to pressure from the gun lobby, you should not support them. Sincerely, Michael R.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: DOVER, Del.—A bill that would have expanded the ability of Delaware authorities to prohibit people with mental health issues from having guns was defeated Thursday in the state Senate even after being revised to placate the National Rifle Association and other critics. Senators voted 13-to-6 Thursday to reject the measure, which was pushed by Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden. His father, Vice President Joe Biden, has been spearheading the administration’s efforts to expand background checks and pass other gun restrictions since the mass shooting last December at a Connecticut elementary school that left 26 dead. The Delaware legislation had cleared the House with only one dissenting vote. “I’m very disappointed. This was a commonsense piece of legislation,” Beau Biden said. “… I can’t explain what happened today in the state Senate.” The bill had been pulled from the Senate agenda Tuesday, but Rep. Michael Barbieri, the chief sponsor, said he was unaware of any problems prior to Thursday’s Senate vote. “I’m pretty shocked, especially since we compromised on our side” said Barbieri, D-Newark. “I thought we had appeased everybody, including the NRA.” After successfully pushing for an amendment to raise the standard of proof for taking away someone’s guns, the NRA took a neutral stance on the bill, neither endorsing nor opposing it. The NRA had said it would oppose the bill unless the standard of proof for declaring a person dangerous was changed from “a preponderance of evidence” as initially written, to “clear and convincing evidence.” “We no longer consider the bill a significant threat to law-abiding gun owners,” NRA lobbyist Shannon Alford told the Senate. But lawmakers said they received several calls in opposition to the bill just prior to the vote. “Today, our phones were flooding,” said Senate sponsor Margaret Rose Henry, a Wilmington Democrat. “… It was a grassroots effort at the last minute that really threw things off.” The bill would have required mental health providers, including licensed school counselors, to call police if they believed a person posed a danger to himself or others. Police would investigate and would refer the case to the attorney general’s office if they believed the person shouldn’t have access to a gun. The attorney general’s office could then ask a judge to prohibit the person from buying or possessing a gun. The judge also could order the seizure of any guns that the person owns. But some critics feared the legislation would infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms and make it difficult for them to get their guns returned. Some lawmakers also expressed concern that the legislation could discourage people from seeking mental health treatment for fear that their firearms could be seized. “I think it went beyond what was correct in being able to confiscate someone’s guns,” said Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford. Beau Biden described the bill as a direct response to mass shootings such as the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo. The suspect in that shooting, which left 12 people dead and 70 injured, was being seen by a psychiatrist before the attack. Said Biden: “I’m not giving up on this.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

The second is a slim black male with a white tank top and hat. The violence occurred around 1a.m. Sunday at 616 E. 52nd Street. Authorities say the shooting erupted after a person was either denied entry or told to leave the party.

131851318,2013-06-26 18:20:30,Jim Carrey Stars in New Kind of Actor Protest,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/ampgjw6iMLg/,en,False,motion pictures,40362,time,http://www.time.com/time/,"The comedian isn't the first to back-pedal on a project, but he's doing it in a new way Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey) strategizes with Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in 'Kick-Ass 2' Follow @TIMECulture If you didn’t guess from the title, Kick-Ass 2 is—like its predecessor—pretty violent. At least one person involved in the production isn’t so happy about that. On June 23, actor Jim Carrey (who plays mobster-cum-crimefighter Colonel Stars and Stripes) tweeted to his 10 million followers that he could not back the film, which is due in theaters Aug. 16 . “I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote, following it up with an apology to his colleagues and the clarification that he was not ashamed of the film itself but, rather, had changed his position on on-screen violence. As Alyssa Rosenberg at ThinkProgress points out, Carrey has not elaborated on what exactly he’s bothered by and why—or even what he means by “cannot support.” Some of his fans have suggested that he donate his earnings from the film to a cause related to violence prevention, but consensus seems to be that he will at least refrain from promoting the movie. Mark Millar, the creator of the comic on which Kick-Ass is based, wrote in response to the tweet that the movie is “one of Carrey’s best-ever performances” and he’s “baffled” by what Carrey said, because it’s: (a) a work of fiction, (b) less violent than superhero blockbusters, (c) a movie that spends time talking about the consequences of violence, and (d) about a vigilante, Carrey’s character, who refuses to carry a gun. (More on that in the video below.) (MORE: TV’s Bumper Crop of Blood) Carrey isn’t the first actor to back-pedal on a project—but he’s still bringing something new into the mix. Most stars do it after the fact, and mostly because they think the movie in question just isn’t much good. Mark Wahlberg, for example, made 2008’s The Happening but then publicly said it was “a bad movie” while promoting The Fighter about two years later. Christopher Plummer waited even longer: he apparently dissed what he called “The Sound of Mucus” for the beloved musical’s 40th anniversary. There’s little incentive for actors to say something before a movie even has a chance to be a success, something they benefit from regardless of quality, unless they think it’s so bad that it will reflect badly on them—which is what happened when Brad Pitt said he tried to walk away from The Devil’s Own, just about a month before that 1997 movie was due in theaters. Likewise, the New York Times review of 1990’s The Freshman includes Marlon Brando‘s public statement that the movie is “horrible” and “going to be a flop” and “a stinker.” On the I-won’t-do-promotions side, Edward Norton refused to promote The Hulk in 2008, due to personal differences with the film’s producers; Sean Connery also refused to participate in 50th-anniversary celebrations for the James Bond franchise. There’s a potential reason few actors follow in Norton’s footsteps: many actor contracts require participation in publicity events; if that’s the case for Carrey, he may face legal repercussions if he follows through on his tweeted intent. Carrey, however, isn’t saying that Kick-Ass 2 is bad—he’s saying it’s, according to his thinking, wrong. This has also happened before; for example, Katherine Heigl told Vanity Fair she thought Knocked Up was sexist. A more apt comparison, however, since that also took place months after the movie was already a hit, is perhaps the decision by movie studios and TV networks to delay violent content in the days and weeks that directly follow events like the Newtown shootings. As TIME’s James Poniewozik wrote back in December, examining that phenomenon on TV, those decisions seem to make sense at the time—but also seem to imply that everything is suddenly all better at some randomly chosen point in the future, when the news cycle has moved on and gun violence (or whatever the tragedy is in a particular case) is no longer in the news. So that’s where Carrey is doing something we don’t see very often: he’s talking about violence in the movies when there hasn’t been a mass shooting in the last couple of days. If he follows through on his tweet, he’ll be bringing the issue into the news independent of anyone actually getting shot—which, no matter one’s take on the issue and no matter the movie, is refreshing to see.

According to an Associated Press report, Perry met officials from the various industries at a downtown Hartford restaurant. As Perry held his meeting, Malloy was setting up shop outside. ""I just thought it would be an appropriate thing, since you guys were all so interested in all this, that I should welcome him to the state,"" Malloy told reporters gathered outside Perry's session, the Connecticut News Junkie reported. Malloy reportedly went on to jab Perry and Texas, suggesting that the Republican could tout his state's ""higher crime rate, the higher murder rate and higher assault rate,"" according to the Hartford Business Journal. After Perry emerged and talked briefly with Malloy, the Texas governor told reporters that the meeting had been cordial, commending Malloy's ""great show of hospitality."" ""It’s a rough business. I get that. But so is competition on an athletic field. I hope we can shake hands, realize that we’re just competitors. We’re all Americans first,"" he said. ""Your governor was hospitable and civil today and I greatly appreciate that.

128941953,2013-06-18 06:00:02, Joe Biden To Make Another Gun Control Push To Congress,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/joe-biden-gun-control_n_3457178.html,en,False,"politics and government,finances,united states politics and government,medicine and health",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost WASHINGTON -- Working to maintain gun policy reform's place in the political conversation, Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday will urge Congress to act on the White House slate of proposals. It's unclear whether Biden will explicitly call for a vote on expanded background checks, the centerpiece of those proposals. But a senior administration official told reporters that Biden ""will make that push"" when it came to arguing for the president's policy prescriptions, which were filibustered in the Senate in April. Biden also will announce on Tuesday that the administration has done well on the scorecard of executive actions to reduce gun violence. President Barack Obama outlined 23 administrative actions he could take without Congress during a speech on Jan. 16. On 21 of them, the administration has ""completely or made significant progress,"" Biden will say, pointing to new money for gun violence and mental health research, greater data sharing between federal and state agencies, and updated emergency management plans. In anticipation of Biden's speech, the White House released a fact sheet detailing the accomplishments on the executive actions. That fact sheet is embedded below. That the administration is marking actions it has taken without congressional approval shows how the gun policy debate has played out this year. On one hand, it shows that the White House isn't ducking the debate, to the delight of many reform advocates. ""I think what the administration thinks -- what can be accomplished through executive action -- is real and necessary, but not sufficient,"" said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ""If all that comes out of this once-in-a-generation debate is teaching kids how to duck and cover during a mass shooting, some members of Congress are going to have a lot to explain when it happens. And it will happen."" The administration's statements also underscore the limits of the president's powers of persuasion when it comes to the legislative branch and gun policy reform. One executive action the administration lists as unaccomplished is getting Todd Jones confirmed as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Senate approval is required for that. And while the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing, the broader chamber hasn't done much more. But that isn't stopping the White House from plowing forward. One administration official quibbled when The Huffington Post asked what prompted the renewed focus on guns. ""I reject the premise,"" the official said. Another senior administration official, who like the others would only speak about legislative plans on condition of anonymity, said that the White House remains ""engaged with members of Congress on this issue"" and has been buoyed by the political backlash to the Senate's rejection of background checks legislation.   ""This is something that continues to be at the top of the agenda of both the president and vice president,"" the official added. The official declined to name members of Congress who have participated in those conversations. Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

Real sorry. Deeply sorry. Deeply, irrevocably sorry to the innocent man that I casually, baselessly, and publicly accused of, I don’t know, maybe being a mass murderer. Because when I was Googling his name I saw the phrase ‘the Tea Party’ and I thought ‘Ooh, that’s an interesting narrative, I should get that on the TV.” Treacher adds: Alex Pappas has provided a helpful list of past smears against the Tea Party. I can’t remember if Jon Stewart got this worked up about any of those, but it’s helpful to look at the pattern. This didn’t happen in isolation, and if it’s still happening after the media’s bizarre, credibility-eroding coverage of Jared Loughner — Palin did it, guys? Really? — then it’s going to keep happening. You can’t shame the shameless. Hell, ABC made George Stephanopoulos an anchor. They have not yet begun to stoop. Oh and speaking of shameless, Ross was also involved as part of the group at ABC that wrote up their first phone call to the terrorist’s mother and tossed in a little editorializing in what should be a straight news story, as this passage with text bolded by Hot Air’s Allahpundit highlights: A California woman who identified herself as the mother of James Holmes, the 24-year-old man federal authorities said is the suspect in a mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, told ABC News her son was likely the alleged culprit, saying, “You have the right person.” The woman, contacted at her home in San Diego, spoke briefly with ABC News and immediately expressed concern her son may be involved in the shooting death of at least 12 people overnight. “You have the right person,” she said, apparently speaking on gut instinct. “I need to call the police… I need to fly out to Colorado.” Don’t miss Kathy Shaidle’s take on this: “Oh great: ‘You have the right person’ is the new ‘Let him have it.’” Update:“The purpose of the news media is not primarily to present news as impartially as possible. It is to improve society — which to liberals means, above all, fighting the Right,” Dennis Prager writes. “So when Brian Ross linked the Aurora mass murderer to the Tea Party, in his mind, he was doing the right thing. Is there one person in America who believes that if Ross had discovered a James Holmes in Aurora active in the ACLU, he would have reported it?” Which dovetails perfectly with John Nolte’s response at Big Journalism: For ABC, the buck must stop not with Ross, but with George Stephanopoulos.

        J. Lester Feder Posted on June 19, 2016, at 12:46 p.m. ET LGBT rights supporters had gathered at the office of Istanbul Pride, where organizers told BuzzFeed News they had planned to gather on the street to read a press statement before dispersing; They did not plan to march. ""They chose to attack although at first they told [the activists] they would let them read their statement,"" Mehmet Akin of LGBT rights group SPoD told BuzzFeed News. ""This is not only against [the] constitution — This is [a] hate crime."" The protesters moved along Istiklal Street, one of Istanbul’s major shopping districts, some chanting slogans like “Gays exist, trans people exist.” #İstanbul: #TransOnurYürüyüşü için #MisSokak'ta toplananlara polis tekrar #PlastikMermi'lerle saldırdı @ahmetsaymadi Polis ekipleri, #TransOnurYürüyüşü'ne katılmak üzere gelen bir kişiyi gözaltına aldı. The activists were hemmed in by nationalist groups and Islamist organizations who had gathered on surrounding streets, pride organizer Görkem Ulumeric told BuzzFeed News. He said they tried to shelter in bars along the thoroughfare. Ultranationalist groups had issued threats to the march, which organizers said felt especially ominous after posts appeared on social media praising last weekend’s mass shooting in an Orlando gay club by a man who pledged allegiance to ISIS. Homo/transphobics burned rainbow flag in Taksim a few minutes ago #TransOnurYürüyüşü Ulumeric witnessed police firing rubber bullets at least twice and saw them deploy tear gas at least three times — scenes also shown on video shared on social media. Mehmet Akin told BuzzFeed News that he was hit by a rubber bullet in the arm. Ulumeric told BuzzFeed News that at least three other LGBT rights activists were detained, but said he did not have a full list of those taken by police. Local media also reported some anti-LGBT protesters were detained. Video sent to BuzzFeed News a man holding a camera being led away. ""The calls to massacre by the jihadists and Salafist groups in the media and on social media complemented the decision of the Governor’s Office to forbid the march and exposed the coalition amongst these groups,"" Trans Pride organizers said in the press statement published online after the gathering was dispersed. ""None of us are safe in a country where jihadist terrorist groups move freely, where borders are opened from one end to the other, where militants are treated in hospitals and sent back to the war zone."" #TransOnurYürüyüşü ne polis saldırısından hemen önce. Buradayız! This weekend may just be a prelude to a clash between LGBT rights supporters and police next weekend, when the city’s LGBT pride march was scheduled to be held; Organizers were expecting as many as a 100,000 people to attend. The event — the largest in the region — was shut down last year by police using tear gas and water cannon. Ema O'Connor and Alp Ozcelik contributed to this post.

If that's what the NSA is trying to do with its mass surveillance of phone records and Internet use, how do Americans feel about that? Loading... June 9, 2013 Every time foreign-influenced attackers successfully strike the United States – the mass shooting at Ft. Hood, the Boston Marathon bombing – government agencies are faulted for failure to “connect the dots.” Why weren’t US Army Maj. Nidal Hasan’s e-mail contacts with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (the American-born imam later killed in a US drone attack in Yemen) seen as reason enough to possibly head off Hasan’s killing 13 people at the Army post in Texas? Why weren’t the Tsarnaev brothers’ possible links to radical Islam – including older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s six-month trip to Russia, where he spent considerable time in the Islamic republics of Chechnya and Dagestan – enough to tip off the FBI to investigate further? Shortly after that trip, Tamerlan began posting YouTube videos exhorting jihad. Connecting the dots is exactly what the National Security Agency says it’s trying to do with the now-revealed programs vacuuming up billions of bits of “meta-data” on telephone calls and Internet use. How do Americans feel about this? With the latest revelations just days – in some cases, hours – old, it’s too soon to know for sure. But since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the public has been generally supportive of national security efforts – sometimes finding those more important than any concern about privacy and other things dear to civil liberties advocates. “Voters give government leeway to snoop” reads the headline on James Hohmann’s piece on Politico.com. “Privacy is sort of like the deficit: In the abstract, voters rate it a serious concern,” Mr. Hohmann writes. “But drill down, and they don’t want to cut the entitlements that balloon federal spending – or end programs that have prevented terrorist attacks. Especially if Americans don’t believe their own computers and phones are being monitored, they are willing to give the government a long leash.” A Pew Research survey in 2011 found that only 29 percent favored “the U.S. government monitoring personal telephone calls and emails” in order to curb terrorism. But Pew found in another poll that 47 percent are more concerned government policies “have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country,” while only 32 percent said they were more concerned the government has gone “too far.” “I wouldn’t want to minimize the concern over privacy at all because it’s definitely there. But at the same time, especially in the wake of Boston and the constant threat people are feeling … protection is foremost,” Carroll Doherty, associate director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, told Politico. “In this general tradeoff, when push comes to shove … more people consistently since 9/11 said protecting the country is a greater concern than restricting civil liberties.” John Dickerson at Slate takes a similar line, headlining his piece “Why Americans Don’t Fear the NSA.” “Polls suggest that people often support measures to catch terrorists that infringe on civil liberties,” he writes. “In a New York Times/CBS poll taken after the Boston Marathon bombing, 78 percent of people said surveillance cameras were a good idea. A CNN poll taken a month later showed the same support for cameras….” But there’s a big caveat here: People were asked in the recent CNN poll if they would allow ""expanded government monitoring of cell phones and email to intercept communications"" to catch suspected terrorists. Fifty-nine percent said no. Similar polls back in 2006 (when similar revelations about the NSA were emerging), got pretty much the same results. Phone surveillance targeting specific individuals or groups was OK; anything seen as a fishing expedition netting vast amounts of data – including from the unwary and innocent – was not. What’s changed since then? A vast expansion in social media, plus much wider use of e-mail and Internet searches – the kind of thing the NSA now has under constant surveillance. These days, too, distrust of government may be wider and deeper – from tea party activism to current Obama administration “scandals” involving Benghazi, IRS shenanigans, and secretly obtaining the phone records of Associated Press and Fox News journalists.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

Manchin counters NRA with his own gun ad,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/usatoday-NewsTopStories/~3/_gYJJ88nevY/,en,False,"law and legislation,computers and the internet,advertising and marketing",4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"Sen. Joe Manchin is fighting back at the NRA's criticism of his gun bill with an unusual TV ad declaring his support for the Second Amendment and independence from the powerful group. ""I'm a lifetime NRA member, but I don't walk in lockstep with the NRA's Washington leadership, this administration or any special interest group,"" Manchin, D-W.Va., says in the spot unveiled Thursday. ""West Virginia, you know me. I haven't changed and you know I've always fought for our gun rights,"" he continues. ""I believe that we can protect the Second Amendment and make the community safer. I think most law-abiding gun owners agree."" Manchin is co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation to expand background checks on gun buyers -- a proposal that died in the Senate this spring. He has tried to revive the bill and is now the target of a six-figure ad campaign led by the National Rifle Association. The ad is unusual because Manchin is dipping into his campaign funds -- reportedly spending slightly more than $100,000 -- well ahead of his next election. The Democrat won a full term last year and isn't up for re-election until 2018. Manchin previewed his ad Thursday on MSNBC. In an interview with the network, Manchin said the NRA leadership has exhibited ""paranoia"" as lawmakers try to adopt gun-control measures in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School six months ago in Newtown, Conn.

But states have been busy passing gun laws of their own in the wake of the December 14 massacre in Newtown. Six months since Sandy Hook: Newtown residents find their voice At least five states have tightened gun laws, including Connecticut, Colorado and New York, while more than a dozen others have loosened them. Several states are still considering measures. Connecticut added more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons, banned armor-piercing bullets and limited gun magazines to a capacity of 10 rounds. Kansas adopted a law saying that federal statues that violate the Second Amendment are no longer applicable in the state, and that any federal agent who tries to enforce federal gun laws faces jail time. At least eight states -- including Arizona, where a 2011 mass shooting killed six people and left then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords badly wounded -- have passed laws that exempt gun permits from public records. Those laws were largely in reaction to a suburban New York newspaper that published an online map pinpointing the addresses of people with gun permits. Meanwhile, states where new gun control measures have been enacted already face court challenges by gun rights supporters. At Colt's Connecticut factory, no apologies for arming America Below is a state-by-state summary of key parts of new gun laws that are in effect or will take effect this year: States that have loosened gun laws: Alabama: Residents can carry loaded guns in their vehicles to their workplace if they have a concealed-carry permit. If they don't have a concealed weapons permit, they can bring a gun to their car but it must be unloaded and locked away. Arizona: There should be no record of ""the identifying information of a person who owns, possesses, purchases, sells or transfers a firearm."" In addition, police departments that conduct gun buyback programs to get guns off the street must sell the guns instead of destroying them. Arkansas: Guns are allowed in church, and licensed faculty and staff at public universities and colleges can carry concealed handguns. Employees of bars and liquor stores who have concealed permits can bring their guns to work. Prosecutors and deputy prosecutors can now carry a firearm, as can members of the parole board, their investigators and a parole revocation judge. A list of residents with concealed weapons permits will no longer be part of the public record. In addition, the governor can no longer suspend the sale of guns during a declared disaster emergency. Idaho: Concealed gun permits are no longer public record, and the state recognizes concealed permits from any state. Kansas: Federal gun laws will no longer be enforced, and any federal agent who tries to enforce federal laws faces arrest, jail time and a fine. The state also now recognizes concealed carry permits from any state. Kentucky: Citizens can openly carry guns in formerly banned public places, including the State Capitol, city halls, council chambers, libraries, community centers, zoos and parks. The only exceptions to the law are schools and colleges. Maine: Names and other personal information of people with gun permits are no longer part of the public record. Mississippi: Concealed weapons permits are no longer public record, and people can now carry partially visible pistols. A new grant will assist law enforcement agencies in providing additional school resource officers in primary and secondary schools. North Dakota: Guns are now allowed in churches. Oklahoma: Recognizes any valid concealed weapons permit from any state. People who seek certain renewals of gun permits will no longer be fingerprinted, effective November 1. District court judges, the state attorney general and assistant attorney generals can carry firearms, effective November 1. South Dakota: Local school boards can train and arm employees, including volunteers, inside the classroom. Concealed weapons permits are now valid for five years, instead of four. Tennessee: Gun owners with concealed permits can keep guns in their vehicles in public or private parking lots effective July 1. Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record. Utah: Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record. A person currently not allowed to possess a firearm because of mental health reasons can petition the state for the right to bear arms. Virginia: Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record, but the state can still release ""statistical summaries, abstracts, or other records containing information in an aggregate form."" West Virginia: Recognizes concealed permits from additional states. Guns can no longer be seized during a declared emergency. Wyoming: Judges can carry a gun into a courtroom, effective July 1. States that have tightened gun laws: Colorado: The state where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora in 2012 made background checks mandatory for all gun purchases and has limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds. Connecticut: More than 100 guns have been added to the state's list of banned assault weapons. Armor-piercing bullets are banned, and gun magazines are limited to a capacity of 10 rounds. Gun owners who currently own magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds can keep them but must register them with the state. All firearms sales, including ones at gun shows, must go through background checks. Stiffer penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns have been authorized. Also, the nation's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons is being created; such information will only be available to law enforcement. Delaware: Background checks on all gun purchases are required, assault weapons are prohibited, and magazine capacity is limited to 10 rounds. Maryland: The state banned the sale of 45 types of assault weapons, including the AR-15, and limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds. Residents purchasing a handgun must be fingerprinted and go through safety training. A single automated gun application process between gun dealers and Maryland state police has been established. New York: High capacity magazines are banned. Assault weapons must be registered within the state, including those already owned by residents. All gun buyers must undergo background checks, including at gun shows and private sales except transactions among immediate family members. Anyone who purchases ammunition must also undergo a background check. Sales of assault weapons on the Internet are banned. Mental health professionals who believe a mental health patient might be a danger to society must report that information to a health care director, who must then relay what they determine to be serious threats to the state Department of Criminal Justice Services."

By BURGESS EVERETT and JAKE SHERMAN 06/10/2013 07:32 AM EDT Updated 06/11/2013 10:06 AM EDT Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) will meet this week with the families who lost relatives in the Newtown, Conn., shooting. The meeting will be Thursday, during the group’s most recent swing through Washington, D.C. “Speaker Boehner’s heart goes out to the victims of this senseless tragedy, and their families,” Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. “He wants to hear their stories and talk about ways to reduce the culture of violence in our country.” The Republican House hasn’t attempted to tighten gun laws in the wake of the shooting — and has shown little appetite to do so. GOP leadership has prepared some options if the Senate passed tighter gun restrictions, but a move to tighten background checks on commercial gun sales failed in March. ( PHOTOS: Politicians speak out on gun control) House Republicans have privately considered renewing the current background check system, promoting legislation to deal with violence in society. They would also consider moving a Republican gun control bill drafted by Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa). Families of several Sandy Hook shooting victims arrive on Capitol Hill this week to try and resurrect the gun control debate. A nonprofit group called Sandy Hook Promise, which was created in the wake of the shootings is intended to spark a legislative dialogue and action on guns, is bringing to the Hill members of seven families of Sandy Hook Elementary School victims, a spokeswoman confirmed to POLITICO. The families will meet with members of both the House and the Senate and will be pushing the background check legislation and the House companion bill. The families will also begin discussions with lawmakers on mental health legislation. The nonprofit will host Nelba Marquez-Greene, Neil Heslin, Nicole Hockley, Terri and Matthew Rousseau, Bill Sherlach, David and Francine Wheeler, and Mark Barden, whose family was the subject of a long profile in The Washington Post on Sunday. The return to Washington by the families will occur on Tuesday and Wednesday and was first reported by The Associated Press. The Capitol Hill lobbying comes the same week as the six-month anniversary of the mass shooting. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, will lead a moment of silence for victims in Newtown on Friday at 9:30 a.m., which will kick off a national bus tour by Mayors Against Illegal Guns to lobby members of Congress to support background checks. The Senate’s background check legislation authored by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) failed in April, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has indicated he plans to huddle with Manchin and Vice President Joe Biden on ways to revive the legislation.

I don't feel any more personal or horrified by the recent mass shootings in Santa Monica that left five dead, just because it happened about three miles from me -- or about half a mile (or to put it another way, 900 yards) from where I had planned to go that day but got too busy and so put it off. I was under no threat, and my reaction is the same wherever it would have occurred. My reaction is -- okay, is it not ""too soon"" to talk about the tragedy yet? And by ""the tragedy,"" I mean the mass shooting at Newtown. Or, maybe I mean Aurora, Colorado. Or perhaps Virginia Tech. Or... The point is that I lose track. It's always ""too soon"" to talk about these mass gun tragedies for the gun manufacturer-owned NRA far-right fringe group. So, we've built up a big backlog of these mass gun tragedies. Having read over the weekend that the gunman had 1,300 rounds of ammunition, it would seem like a perfectly fine time to start talking about this mass gun-killing in Santa Monica, too. But hey, that's just me. Me, I think a killing with one round is appropriate to start talking about, and 1,300 rounds would demand it. After all, imagine if the gunman has been able to use all 1,300 rounds, which one has to figure was the point. That we lucked out that he didn't get that far is what makes it all the more palatable that we can talk about it. Otherwise, the world would probably be speechless. Having read on Tuesday that a teacher once spotted the alleged killer surfing the Internet about assault weapons, and that the police were informed and he was admitted to a psych ward, it would seem reasonable to assume that even when measures are taken properly with someone who has mental problems, that guns can still get in their hands. But hey, that's just me, too. Me, I just think that when someone with psychiatric problem can get his hands on so much guns and ammunition, it's an appropriate time to be taking about better controls. I keep thinking of the late-Charlton Heston's infamous line, when he was the president of the gun manufacturer-owned NRA, about us having to pry his guns from his ""cold, dead hands."" What tends to get lost in the chest-thumping bravado of the statement is that while the mass-murdering gunman was able to keep his gun in his warm, live hands, it was the innocent victims whose hands ended up very cold and even more dead. Though it's another quote from Mr. Heston -- who apropos of nothing, went to my high school, and whose sister Lila taught at Northwestern University in the School of Speech when I got my Bachelors degree in Speech there -- that also comes to mind. That's when he said on Meet the Press in 1997, ""Any gun in the hands of a decent person is no threat to anybody -- except bad people"" Since ""any"" is pretty much all-inclusive, I would assume that in the Mr. Heston's all-continuing universe that would include the 4-year-old boy who just over the weekend accidentally shot and killed his father. On the other cold, dead hand, I'm sure that that father thought his four-year-old son was wonderfully decent. Even with the gun in his hands posing a tragic threat. By the way, it was a year after saying this that Mr. Heston was elected president of the gun manufacturer-owned NRA, so it would seem that the far-right outlier fringe group didn't have a problem with the sentiment. Which is why they have so much blood on those cold-dead hands. The mass killings in Santa Monica didn't get as much attention nationally as some of the other (many other) recent mass killings, but perhaps that's because only five people were killed. But the killer had 1,300 rounds of ammunition. I repeat, 1,300 rounds of ammunition. Just imagine if... * To read more from Robert J.

On Friday, 23-year-old John Zawahri shot and killed his father and brother. He then forced a woman to drive him to the campus of Santa Monica College, where he killed three more people. Police eventually arrived on the scene and killed Zawahri during an exchange of gunfire. Both college policy and California law forbid anyone other than law enforcement officials from bringing guns on campus. A college spokesman says the school is determined to maintain its ban on firearms, while the school’s president argues that the rampage was not technically a school shooting. “Possessions of firearms or replicas, ammunition, explosives, knives/blades longer than 21/2 inches, other weapons, or fireworks are against the law in the College community or at College–sponsored activities,” according to SMC’s website. “California Penal Codes 626.9 and 626.10 also prohibit the possession of firearms (including pellet and BB guns) on College property without specific written permission of the Chief of Police.” Conservative commentators frequently question whether gun free zones, like the one in effect at SMC, actually deter violence. John Lott, an economist and author of the book “More Guns, Less Crime,” has written that mass shooters actively seek out gun free zones, knowing that they are less likely to encounter armed resistance, since bystanders won’t have weapons. “Why won’t these news stories mention that another attack has occurred where guns are banned?” he wrote in a recent blog post about the SMC shooting. “At some point everyone has to understand the pattern here.” Universities should be able to decide whether they want to allow people to carry guns on campus, wrote Jacob Hornberger, president of the Future of Freedom Foundation. “The state should butt out of the matter,” he wrote in an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “If one university says that guns are allowed, so be it. If another says no guns allowed, so be it.” Hornberger wrote that he himself would be more inclined to attend a university that allowed students and staff to arm themselves, however. “A would-be murderer would be crazy to go on a shooting spree in anything but a gun-free university,” he wrote. “In a gun-free university, he would know that no one would be able to defend himself.” But a spokesperson for SMC said that the college had no reason to reconsider its gun ban, regardless of the state of California’s gun laws. “There is no need to revisit it, we don’t allow guns,” he said in an interview with The DC News Foundation. “It’s explicitly banned.” In a public statement made on Friday, College President Chui Tsang said that the crime did not meet the definition of a school shooting. “I want to reiterate that today’s incident was not a school shooting,” he said. “It began off campus and was the result of a shooting suspect attempting to evade officers by running on to the campus.” The the final three victims, however, were staff members and students, and were killed on or near SMC grounds, according to subsequent reports. It was also reported that Zawahri had a connection to SMC, a history of mental illness, and a previous run-in with police.

Thursday, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with the families at the White House. “We commend the families’ courage and perseverance in continuing to press for commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said. “And we want them to know that, as we approach the six-month anniversary of that terrible day, we will never forget and we will continue to fight alongside them.” After lobbying members of Congress at their Washington offices on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Newtown families on Thursday held an event at the Capitol to remind lawmakers and the nation of the tragic Dec. 14 shooting — and all the gun violence that has occurred since. Yet, according to the Associated Press: Reid said talks aimed at finding the 60 votes the measure will need to prevail “have not borne much fruit yet,” but predicted they will. Now, that is a surprise. Do you mean to say that a couple of months after the bill went down, there isn’t, magically, a groundswell of support for its revival? That the statistics showing that Americans really don’t care about this and don’t want the Senate to spend its time on it haven’t changed? That the 2014 elections are still going to be held in 2014, and that conservative Democrats still fear the voters on this issue? Next I’ll learn that pushing for more gun control might not be the best move in the wake of the IRS, DOJ, EPA, and NSA scandals, and with a precariously placed immigration bill’s moving through the Senate. Do these people never learn? Well, apparently not. Gabby Giffords has followed up on the New York Times op-ed that my colleague Kevin Williamson correctly termed “childish” and “embarassing” with a column in the Newtown Bee that manages — somehow — to be even more childish and embarassing. It contains an awful lot of this: We cannot bring Christina-Taylor, or the beautiful, bright faces of the first graders of Sandy Hook Elementary, back.  We cantell you that, from where we stand, two years after our gun violence tragedy, we grieve our losses the same. But we have also gained clarity of purpose, and we take great joy from standing shoulder to shoulder with each other, loving stranger’s children enough to say, as if they were our own, we must do better. And not very much of this: Gun-related homicides and crime are “strikingly” down from 20 years ago, despite the American public’s belief that firearm crime is on the upswing, a new study said Wednesday. Looking back 50 years, a Pew Research Center study found U.S. gun homicides rose in the 1960s, gained in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s and the early 1990s, and then plunged and leveled out the past 20 years. This is true despite the introduction into American law of liberalizing gun rules that opponents claimed would turn America into the Wild West. Oh, and school shootings are at a 20-year low, too.

Like the killers in the Gabby Giffords case, the Aurora case, the Newtown case, the Virginia Tech case, and too many others to mention, the dangerous mentally ill represent a persistent threat to public safety. Yet the Obama administration and Democrats have chosen to focus on guns. Gun violence is actually down nationally over the past 20 years, while gun ownership is up. But mass shootings and other violence by the mentally ill have become more common. Conservatives have devoted a lot of energy to defending gun rights, and that’s fine. But the need for reform of our mental-health system is also an urgent concern that too few are talking about. In today’s Wall Street Journal, the mother of a mentally ill young man who eventually committed suicide summarizes the sad reality of the system we’ve created — a system that respects the “right” of the mentally ill to decline treatment. It fails both the mentally ill themselves who are “free” to wander the streets beset by delusions and preyed upon by street criminals, and it fails to protect society. Here is the letter: I’m the mother of an adult son who suffered from severe and persistent bipolar disorder. His downward course was aided by this country’s broken mental-health system, a system that prevents families from getting loved ones timely, humane treatment. He took his life six years ago. Judges at commitment hearings would take the easy way out and release him time and time again, ruling he was not an imminent danger to himself or others, many times against the recommendation of the treating psychiatrist. On release, he would eventually resurface in another city, another state, at which time he would again be arrested and the commitment process would start all over again. Most states have such strict commitment laws that it is almost impossible to get people committed for treatment until they are in deep crisis. Allowing my son to roam the country in his untreated psychotic, bipolar world under the pretense of protecting his civil right to refuse treatment is absurd. He had a civil right to receive treatment even though his illness precluded his ability to recognize he was ill. And the general public also has a right to be protected from the consequences of nontreatment of potentially dangerous mentally ill individuals. When my son told me of his plan to exercise his constitutional right to bear arms to protect himself from federal agents he felt certain were trying to assassinate him, I feared he might actually purchase a gun and shoot innocent victims he mistook for federal agents. I inquired how to register his name with the appropriate authorities to prevent this from happening; I wanted to at least confirm that his name was in the FBI database that licensed firearms dealers use to run background checks on prospective buyers. Due to the privacy laws, I was unable to even confirm my son’s name was in the database. Unable to get him treated, unable to prevent him from purchasing a gun, my hands were tied. If we want to prevent the next Newtown, we must reform our mental-health laws. Mental illness is treatable. It doesn’t have to be terminal. Dottie Pacharis West River, Md.

The ads make it look like a pretty unimaginative horror flick, especially with its premise of people trapped in a house as killers in supposedly creepy masks try to make their way in for a bloodbath. And it's true -- the horror movie aspects of The Purge are pretty lackluster. But the action and, surprisingly, the political and social commentary that seems to criticize republican ideological dogma still has me pondering what I thought would be a run-of-the-mill slasher movie. I've been thinking about The Purge so much that I made two videos about it. The first is my ReThink Review of The Purge. The second video has my thoughts on how I think The Purge illustrates flaws in some of the beliefs that today's ""modern"" republican party is built on. (Transcripts for both the videos follow.)

But the dark secret that supposedly enables this utopia is an annual event called the Purge, a night when all laws, law enforcement, and emergency services are suspended, allowing a 12-hour government-sanctioned orgy of violence where personal and societal sins are both punished and cleansed, while those not wanting to take part seal themselves behind fortress-like security systems, if they can afford one. Now, if you put aside the fact that this is a ridiculous concept that no marginally sane population would even contemplate, you still have a pretty flawed movie. But The Purge is a lean and nicely tough piece of work with some truly heart-stopping moments of tense action and a heaping helping of intriguing social commentary that will rile conservatives if they or anyone else bothers seeing it. And I actually have so much to say about The Purge that this is going to be a first of its kind two-part rethink review.  Set in 2022 but more like a current-day alternate reality, The Purge mostly takes place in the spacious suburban home of the Sandin family. The father James (played by Ethan Hawke) is a rising star in the obviously lucrative home security business and has outfitted nearly all of the houses in his gated community, including his own, with barricades and surveillance. James' wife Mary (played by Lena Headey), resentful teenage daughter Zoey (played by Adelaide Kane), and techy 10-year-old son Charlie (played by Max Burkholder) plan to lock themselves away until the Purge is over, while their neighbors plan to spend the night socializing or preparing for their own deadly excursions.  But things go downhill fast when a bloodied, unnamed man makes his way into the Sandins' house. The man, who seems to be a veteran and is played by Edwin Hodge, is being pursued by an armed gang of seemingly affluent, sadistic young white couples wearing creepo masks, led by a polite prep school type (played by Rhys Wakefield) who demands the Sandins give up the vet for ""purging"" or the weirdos will bust in and kill everyone inside. The Purge is being marketed as a horror movie, which it technically is, though that's also the film's biggest problem. To me, The Purge isn't a horror movie -- it's a weird, violent cautionary suburban psychological thriller action fable about what would happen if the Tea Party took control of a desperate America and tried to fix things by creating a holiday based on their gun-loving, violent, racist, religious, jingoist, libertarian fantasies. Which I'll talk more about in the second video.  The problem is that the horror aspects of The Purge are cliché or ineffective, like all the tiptoeing down dark hallways with a flashlight, and especially the weirdos' supposedly creepy affectations and skulking, though Wakefield does quite a nice job as the head weirdo, and is the only one who doesn't wear a mask. It's these played-out horror movie trappings that lead to a truly laughable ending that reminds you that the whole idea of the Purge itself barely makes sense. But in non-horror ways, The Purge works well, particularly in the tense, messy action scenes that truly got my pulse pounding, making me glad this movie took an R rating instead of a more bloodless PG-13. The performances are good, especially Hawke, and there's a welcome but understated naturalness to the dialogue between the family members. The production design is also well done, though you'll find yourself wondering how big this freaking house is that so many people can't find each other in it.  I think a lot of critics are going to dismiss The Purge, and they may be right to. You'll get a few startled jumps, but The Purge isn't satisfying as a horror movie, the concept of the Purge itself is fairly ludicrous, and it's got a crap ending. And I'm sure critics will slam The Purge for its attempts at social commentary, claiming that the movie takes itself too seriously or has a scattershot approach to addressing the issues. But while you can call it scattershot, that doesn't mean it isn't aimed, because The Purge is pointed right at conservative ideology in a way that makes it one of the most interesting movies I've seen this year. So join me at my second video on The Purge and I'll explain why. PART 2 Transcript While The Purge has a lot of flaws, which I talked about in my review, it's got some interesting social and political commentary that I think is directed right at Tea Baggers' faces. That's because the night of The Purge, when all laws and law enforcement are suspended and murder is legal for 12 hours, is rooted and executed based on the failed dogma of conservative ideology. And the results, predictably, aren't pretty. The concept of the Purge, which was created by politicians calling themselves the New Founding Fathers, is based on several beliefs that strike me as distinctly conservative. The first is that people are inherently and inescapably violent and hateful and lots of them ready to kill you. Second is that justifies anyone and everyone arming themselves to the teeth in case they need to execute someone based on a personal, legal, or religious-based concept of justice. Third is that by arming and isolating yourself, preferably being white, and most importantly being wealthy, you can and deserve to seal yourself off from the suffering of the poor, unfortunate, and brown. As you probably guessed, none of this turns out to be true, starting with that last one. As the violence escalates, Ethan Hawke's character James says what we've heard so many times after a grisly murder or yet another mass shooting -- that this sort of thing isn't supposed to happen here. Not that it shouldn't be happening anywhere, but it should be happening to someone somewhere else, which also implies that those people expect it or maybe deserve it.  As we hear a TV reporter say, Purge killings happen primarily in poorer minority neighborhoods where people can't afford expensive security systems like the ones James sells. And yes, there is a slight racial element to The Purge, with the fact that the masked weirdos are all white and the man they're chasing is black. But the weirdos' obsession with the veteran seems to have more to do with class, and that's where the shots at conservatives really come into focus. The head weirdo (played by Rhys Wakefield) looks and sounds like he's right out of the Young Republicans, or more accurately the Mitt Romney campaign. There's a lot of religious and patriotic grandstanding, and of course using God and country to justify the most repugnant cruelty. The head weirdo tries to relate to James as being ""one of our own"", assuming that means white and/or affluent, and tries to reassure James that the veteran he's harboring is a ""non-contributing"" member of society, most likely one of the 47%, as Mitt Romney would say, or a ""taker"" if you're Paul Ryan or one of his Ayn Rand-worshipping fellow republicans, which is essentially all of them. There's a question in the film if the Purge is meant to exorcise the sin of rage and violence within us all, or if it's for the more affluent who can afford bigger guns and better protection to purge society of whoever they think is unneeded or undesirable. Do I think republicans think the poor, homeless, and defenseless -- especially if they're brown -- deserve to die? Well, yes! if they're outside the womb. All you have to do is look at republicans' long record of opposition to programs that improve and prolong the lives and health of the less fortunate, like universal healthcare, food stamps, school lunches, stem cell research, hate crime legislation, unemployment, and pollution restrictions just to name a few. And it seems republicans believe that if you aren't able to save your own life, you should do the honorable thing and just die instead of being a drain on taxpayers. But The Purge attacks conservatives from another direction, showing that it's really hard to let someone suffer and die in front of you, regardless of their sins. That no matter how well you arm, barricade, and isolate yourself, tragedy and the suffering of your fellow citizens will ultimately touch you. That you can't trust everyone to responsibly use lethal force. That when you say that it's everyone for themselves, it not only means that no one is coming to help you, but that you shouldn't help other people. And while a lot of gun nuts like to brag about how armed and ready they are to kill when there's a race war, a societal collapse, or someone tries to take their guns, The Purge shows that killing another human, even a masked psychopath, is terrifying, rarely heroic or cool, and inevitably changes you forever. As you can see, there's a LOT going on in The Purge, way more than I expected. And while I'm a bit torn on whether to recommend it or not, I can at least say that I've definitely kept on thinking about it. Follow ReThink Reviews on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. PIERS MORGAN, CNN HOST:  Shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary.  I'll talk to the families of two teachers killed by Adam Lanza.  They met with President Obama today.        And I'll ask Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy about his war against the NRA.  Plus new details on the growing NSA leak investigation.  And Donald Trump weighs in on the battle between privacy and security in America.  He also takes on the Obama scandals and Hillary Clinton's political future.        Plus on ""The Grill"" tonight, Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan, CNN's dynamic duo talk ""NEW DAY"" and much, much more.        We have breaking news tonight on Syria's use of chemical weapons. CNN's Chris Lawrence has the latest.        CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Piers, tonight there is a major policy shift from the U.S. towards Syria as U.S. officials for the first time now conclusively say that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons and therefore crossed the red line that President Obama set.  A White House officials said, quote, ""Following a deliberate review our intelligence community assesses that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons including the nerve agent sarin on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year.""        Now sarin is a lethal gas that can kill a man within minutes.  It can paralyzed the lungs.  Sources tell CNN that sarin was used at least eight times over the past year and killed up to 150 people.  Now the U.S. has been providing non-lethal aid to those rebels, food, medicine, communications gear.  The rebels have asked for shoulder- fired missiles, for anti-tank weapons and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition.        White House officials aren't specifying exactly what support, what military support will be given but they are confirming that there is a move now to give those rebels direct military support.        I'm told by sources that that will not include establishing a no- fly zone which would involve rescue teams, American pilots, bombing runs, but that some of those weapons may be on the table given to the rebels in some form perhaps through European allies or other allies in the region.       There is a renewed sense of urgency within the Pentagon and the administration after Iranian-backed fighters helped the Syria government recapture one city and strategically placed its forces to take another -- Piers.        MORGAN:  Chris, thank you very much.        Let's get to our other breaking stories.  Extreme weather and the wildfires in Colorado.  With us tonight, CNN's Victor Blackwell, live in Colorado Springs, and Chad Myers in the CNN Severe Weather center.        We'll begin with Chad.        CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  You know, Piers, it has been a rough day.  Even Washington, D.C. got in on the act.  And Rockville, Maryland, you have a tornado not that far from you.  A lot of power lines down, trees down in places where you don't think about severe weather.        Right now the severe weather has just run through Atlanta, Georgia, from the north.  Here's a live shot from our tower cam. We've been seeing lightning strikes all the way here.  This is looking south to the southeast.  There you see the flash at this point.  It's still sparking there just to the south of Atlanta.  We're talking about McDonough and also back down here just to the south of the I-20.       Something else that we've watched all day is the wind out west. You talked about that.  You talked about how the dry air and the wind and the heat out in Colorado have just baked this ground.  Baked it's where you just not much living left in some of these areas.  Some of these grasses, some of these shrubs and bushes are just dry from years of drought.  Things have cooled down slightly.  Colorado Springs 78, but the winds are still south at 28 miles per hour, and for the next couple of days, those winds don't die off.        Those winds are fanning the flames and those flames are just completely out of control and our Victor here, he's out there in this smoke-infested area giving you the latest on this live report -- Victor.        VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Chad, thanks, the latest here 15,700 acres burned and 5 percent contained.  A small victory but a victory nonetheless.  And the fire that you mentioned is so tough to fight because of those gusty winds.        The big headline tonight, the Black Forest fire has become what so many hoped and prayed that it would not become the deadly Black Forest fire.  Two bodies were recovered today by the Sheriff's Office. The sheriff is not giving a lot of information about them but he says they were trying to retrieve a few items during an evacuation.        Also today a first for the city proper of Colorado Springs.  An evacuation of 3,000 people, about 6,000 people also asked to leave in a voluntary evacuation.  So many people out of their homes, 360 homes lost, and we want to bring in now two people who, unfortunately, are part of that number who lost their home in the Black Forest fire.       We've got Kyle Kirkland here, Danielle Byrne, and their three dogs, Kia, Jack and Shadow, and first, we want to share with you, of course, our sorrow for you losing your home, but you were asked to leave in the first evacuation.  When did you learn that this was so serious?        KYLE KIRKLAND, LOST HOME IN COLORADO FIRE:  I was actually at work, and I got a text message from one of my boys' parents on my soccer team asking me if we've been evacuated and not knowing what was going on, I turned the radio on and by that time we were already in the mandatory evacuation, so I ended up locking up the gym early, speeding down the Black Forest to grab the dog.        BLACKWELL:  What could you grab when you left?  What did you have with you?        DANIELLE BYRNE, LOST HOME IN COLORADO FIRE:  Well, I was at work but the only he was able to grab was the dogs.  He didn't have enough time.  Smoke was all over our house, by that time, so he finally grabbed some important things and get out as fast as we could.        BLACKWELL:  Now I understand it was pretty difficult to get back and get the dogs.  A friend told you that, you know, things are getting serious around your home.  How tough was it?        KIRKLAND:  It was pretty tough by the time I got back to (INAUDIBLE), the police closed it off and I got out of my car and I asked them listen, I have three dogs, it will take me five minutes to get down there, I'll be back within a flash and he told me that I was risking my own life and obviously did what I have to do for our family.        BLACKWELL:  You went back to get them.  Now, Danielle, tell me about this moment you had in Target when you realized the gravity of what was happening.        BYRNE:  Well, we already found out that the house was gone but it didn't actually hit me until I went to Target and I had to buy all these things that I already should have had like socks and undergarments, shampoo, conditioner.  Spending all this money on stuff that I had in my house that obviously I no longer have so that was --        (CROSSTALK)      BLACKWELL:  What were you feeling at that moment?        BYRNE:  I mean, I wanted to have a meltdown.  I mean, I felt homeless.  I mean, I felt out of place, I felt -- I mean, so many mixed emotions, I just -- I just wanted to go home and that was no longer an option.        BLACKWELL:  So do -- you say you felt homeless.  Where are you guys staying now?        KIRKLAND:  We are staying actually at Danielle's friend's house. She's an office in the Air Force and she has a house off Fillmore and Meade so we're down there for right now.        BLACKWELL:  I've also read that you now want to volunteer at these shelters, why?        KIRKLAND:  We've experienced first-hand how it feels and we have a lot of friends in the Black Forest community, friends, family and we just -- we want to give back to them.        BLACKWELL:  All right.  Kyle Kirkland and Danielle Byrne, Jack, Shadow, Kia, thank you all for speaking with us today.        15,700 acres, that's just the number, the 360 homes lost.  Again, just a number, but when you hear the stories from the people here, you really get an idea of how much is lost but how much they still have. I had a conversation with the sheriff here yesterday and he said that this is a resilient community.  After so much was lost after the Waldo Canyon fire last year, people rebuilt, they supported each other, they worked in the shelters, to help the other people who had lost so much more and we're seeing that again this year.        Now this fire is continuing to burn as we said just 5 percent contained, almost 500 -- change that, the update tonight was 750 firefighters working on this.  There's a federal incident commander here trying to take advantage of the increased humidity to try to get this fire out, but it's been really unpredictable with the winds that will continue.        Back to you, Piers.        MORGAN:  Thanks very much.  And tomorrow marks six months since the massacre in Newtown.  Six months since Adam Lanza murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary.  You know where I stand on the issue of guns but has anything changed since that awful day?        Joining me now is Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut.        Senator Murphy, thank you for joining me.  This is the big question for me.  Six month have now gone by, nearly 5,000 more Americans have been killed by guns and it seems to me, let's be brutally honest, absolutely nothing has changed and this prompts the question, if nothing changes when 20 children get murdered, when does it change?        SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT:  Yes, how can you look in the eyes of the families of these murdered 6 and 7-year-olds and tell them that we can't do anything when the facts are the facts that in Columbine if we had universal background checks those guys might not have gotten the guns.        If we had had limits on magazine clips there'd probably be people still alive in Aurora and Tucson and 20 kids got shot at inside Sandy Hook and all of them died because of the power of that assault rifles. So here's what's changed, Piers, is that there is a political infrastructure now built up around the gun issue.       And I will tell you, some of my colleagues in the Senate who went the wrong way back in April are looking for a different path forward because they don't want to go up against Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Gabby Giffords' group, and Moms Demand Action when it comes to elections next year.        That has changed and that may provide us a path back to getting a bill on the floor of the Senate before the end of this year.        MORGAN:  I mean, what it needs, it just needs some of guts.  And need some of these people to stand up to the NRA.  The NRA as it always does has come up with another threatening attack ad, this time against Senator Manchin in his home state, attacking him for a bill that would have strengthened background checks which seems to be the very least that should be happening.        Let's watch the NRA ad.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Remember this TV add?        SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  I'm Joe Manchin, I approve this ad because I'll always defend West Virginia.  As your senator I'll protect our Second Amendment rights.        UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was Joe Manchin's commitment, but now Manchin is working with President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Concerned?  You should be.  Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:  I mean, this is what they do, isn't it, Senator?  They just bully, threaten, cajole, spend money, try to force politicians on the back front.  And unfortunately, it usually works.        MURPHY:  Yes, but why does it work?  I mean, the fact is that these guys have become pretty miserable at winning elections.  In 2012 the NRA targeted 16 Senate seats.  They spent money in 16 Senate seats.  You know how many of those they won?  Three.  They lost 13 of 16.  You were better off being against the NRA.  I would argue now more than ever than being with them and this whole idea about, you know, his commitment to the Second Amendment.        I'm committed to the Second Amendment, too, but there's no constitutional scholar who tells you that the Second Amendment protects 100 rounds of ammunition or dangerous assault weapons.  The Second Amendment has limitations.  Just like the First Amendment does. And that's why Joe Manchin is a big supporter of the Second Amendment and the main proponent of universal background checks.        MORGAN:  Of course he is.  And there is an absolutely hypocrisy in the position that many people up in Washington.  Let's take an example, Lindsey Graham, who I happen to personally like, but he's very pro-Second Amendment, very pro-gun rights, very anti any new form of gun control or background checks, and yet he's one of the first people to pop up in the last week whole heartedly endorsing the NSA gathering all this date and information about Americans, seemingly oblivious to hypocrisy of that position, when one of his arguments against background check and why should the government have all this information on us?        MURPHY:  Yes, you know, it's never made a lot of sense to me. The NRA came out and said, you know what, after Sandy Hook what we should really have is a database of everybody who's mentally ill in this country and we're just going to track them to make sure that they don't do something dangerous.        First of all, that a grievous violation of privacy but second, if you don't have a registry of who has these dangerous guns, what is the information about people who have mental illness do you?  The fact is is that there's hypocrisy all over this place, and so long as the NRA essentially strikes the fear into the hearts of lots of senators, it's going to continue.        MORGAN:  Just a segue quickly to the NSA scandal.  The FBI director Robert Mueller testified before the House Judiciary Committee earlier today.  He invoked 9/11 saying had these programs been in place before 9/11 it may have prevented what happened.        Listen to what he said.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      ROBERT MUELLER, FBI DIRECTOR:  If we had the telephone number from Yemen we would have matched it up to that telephone number in San Diego.  The simple fact that their detention could have derailed the plan in any case, the opportunity was not there.  If we had had this program, that opportunity would have been there.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:  Senator, you've been briefed on a lot of this stuff. And where do you see the line being drawn?  Clearly they're going to get some success with what they're doing in thwarting some kind of terrorist activity.  But at what risk and damage to the average American privacy, do you think?        MURPHY:  Well, clearly, the information that they've gleaned from this program has led to some bad guys being stopped from doing bad things.  I think it's -- probably a little bit of an overreached to say that we would have stopped 9/11 if this program had been in a place.  We don't know what people would have done with that information.  But to me the issue is this.  That I think that the administration needs to give the American people more credit.        I think that we should be having much more public debate about some of these private programs.  Not -- not giving out detailed information but leveling with the American public about what kind of information that the administration thinks it needs.  My problem is that so much of the war on terror is being conducted behind closed doors, whether it'd be the drone program, or whether it'd be these NSA data collection programs.        And the American public doesn't need to know every detail but they certainly should be part of the discussion.        MORGAN:  Senator Murphy, thank you very much indeed for joining me.        MURPHY:  Thanks, Piers.        MORGAN:  Coming up next, a man who never holds back, Donald Trump takes on Washington, the NSA leaks, Obama's second-term scandals, and whether he thinks Hillary Clinton will run and possibly win in 2016. That's all coming up.        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      CONAN O'BRIEN, HOST, ""CONAN"":  Due to the government's spying scandals, sales of the classic George Orwell book ""Nineteen Eighty- Four"" have skyrocketed.  That's true.  So the fallout from the scandal was worse than we thought.  It's making Americans read.        (LAUGHTER)      That's frightening.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:  Conan O'Brien making light of the NSA leaks.  But it's a serious matter to many people.  Donald Trump is the man with some pretty serious opinions about himself.  Are we making too much of the surveillance and should the focus really be on the leaker Edward Snowden?        Well, Donald Trump joins me now on the phone.        Donald, how are you?        DONALD TRUMP, REAL ESTATE MOGUL (via phone):  I'm fine, Piers.        MORGAN:  Great to talk to you.  What is your reaction --        TRUMP:  Nice talking to you.        MORGAN:  What is your reaction to this?  Because look at it in the bigger picture.  Clearly a number of Americans are concerned about the level to which their privacy is being attacked here but at the same time a lot of secrets are being spilled.  Where do you sit?        TRUMP:  Well, let's start off with Snowden.  I think he's bad news.  I've watched him and he's having a good time.  And of all places he goes to Hong Kong for protection.  That is itself is a little bit interesting because that's not a place where actually he should get that kind of protection but it looks like they are going to protect him.  So I don't know what information he's given them but it could be very serious.  He's a bad guy.  I have no doubt that he's a bad guy.        As far as, you know, privacy, certainly we want the privacy.  Now people are saying that this is national security and it really depends on how far they're going and that will come out, but we do want privacy.  We also want national security.        MORGAN:  Rand Paul today said he's going to challenge the constitutionality of the court order, presumably under the Fourth Amendment.  Listen to what he had to say.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  Americans are rightly concerned about having all of their phone records collected and monitored all of the time.        We're here today to announce that we will be challenging the constitutionality of the court order that collects all of American cell phone data all of the time.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:   To Rand Paul there making it pretty clear that he thinks this is a breach, I would imagine, of the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans here.  And it's a serious business if that's what it is.        TRUMP:  Well, Piers, it's certainly a point of view, and there's no question about it that this is a mess no matter how you look at it. It is a mess.  You know, where do they stop?  How far do they go? What kind of power do they have?        So it is a point of view and some very conservative people feel that way and some, frankly, very liberal people.  I mean, we're looking at a lot of people are concerned about how far are they going to go, and that's what we're talking about.        MORGAN:  What about journalists?  Peter King said yesterday he thinks journalists should potentially be prosecuted, maybe even go to jail for publishing and reporting leaks like this.  Do you agree with that?        TRUMP:  Well, I think that -- and we've had this over the years and we've had it actually a number of times over the years but there's never been anything quite like this and there's never been -- you know, this is all because of what's happened with all of the e-mails and the twitters and all of -- you know, what's taking place in a computerized world.        Ten years ago you write on the back of an envelope.  You write something down on a piece of paper.  Today everything, whatever you put down is there, and it's there forever.  It's indelible.  So it is going to be -- it's a real problem for this country, and you look at the kind of secrets that are being given out.  A lot of people are saying China has learned more from this young man that -- and you know, without a high school education that had access to everything you could possibly have access to.  I mean, what kind of security is this?  This is tremendous security breach.        MORGAN:  I mean, there is another way of looking at some of what he's done in the sense if you're not American, you're looking at it from the outside saying, America has been accusing the Chinese of hacking computers here for a long time now, and Snowden has revealed and apparently has the proof to back this up that America has been hacking Chinese computers for the last three to four years.  Is that not in the public interest?        TRUMP:  Well, China is having a field day because that's true. Over the last especially year we've been talking about them hacking, right?  And now all of a sudden you look at what's going on and China is -- over the last couple of days, they're talking about us hacking. We do far more than they've ever done and they are having an absolutely field day.        I think the bigger field day is what is Snowden giving them?  How much information is Snowden giving them?  Because it sounds like he's got just about all the information we have in this country.        MORGAN:  Yes.  Absolutely.  Well, one other thing that leaked out today was about a friend of yours and mine, Rupert Murdoch.  You're a billionaire who's been married three times.  He's a billionaire who's just divorcing his third wife.  Are you surprised by that news?        TRUMP:  Well, I was surprised.  I know him and like Rupert a lot. I know and like Wendy a lot.  And I never saw this coming.  This is really very surprising to me and it was surprising to a lot of other people, including my daughter Yvanka who's a good friend of theirs.        MORGAN:  Yes, I mean, what do you -- what do you hear or think is maybe behind it?        TRUMP:  Well, I don't hear anything.  I mean, I was just very surprised to hear the news.  I was very saddened by it.  They are both very good people, and so I was really surprised and I'm sure you were probably more surprised than anybody.        MORGAN:  Yes.  It's a hell of a shock, I think, for anyone that knows them both.  And I --        TRUMP:  To me, if you know Rupert, and if you know the whole situation, that to me is a -- you know, it's a very big story.        MORGAN:  Yes.        TRUMP:  Because I just thought they got along really well.  I was very, very saddened to hear about it.        MORGAN:  Yes, I'm with you.  I'm sad about it, too.        Let's move on to Hillary Clinton.  A lot of activity with her this week.  She burst on to Twitter, which many saw as a sign that she's bracing everyone for a run in 2016 then she was hit by State Department scandal allegations, cover-ups over sex scandals and so on.       What do you think of Hillary generally and what do you think of her chances if she does run a success in 2016?        TRUMP:  Well, she's getting hit very hard.  There is no question about it.  I've always liked her on a very personal basis.  I've liked her and her husband a lot.  In fact he was on your show saying that he likes me.  So --        MORGAN:  He was, yes.        TRUMP:  You know, it's hard not to like somebody --        (LAUGHTER)      MORGAN:  Yes.        TRUMP:  But I like him and I think he does like me and we played golf together.  And, you know, I've just always gotten along very well.  They are members of my club up in West Chester and they're wonderful members actually, and wonderful people.  So I've always liked Hillary.        I think that if Benghazi and all of this stuff that's been coming up lately because she is -- has been getting hit very hard but if it doesn't stick, which perhaps it will and perhaps it won't, I think she's going to be the easy nominee for the Democrats.        MORGAN:  Do you think that she could win?  There is a lot of traction now behind Chris Christie who I've found an extremely engaging impressive charter whenever I interviewed him.  Do you think that he could put on a real race with Hillary?  It was a hell of a fight for the media but I could see that being a really great running.       TRUMP:  Well, he's another friend of mine and I think he'd be very effective and I think that he will be certainly somebody that you cannot mess with.  It'll be a very interesting race if that's the race.  But I know there are a lot of people on both sides that are thinking about it very seriously.  I know Hillary's numbers have gone down.  They've been a little bit affected and some people would say quite a bit affected by what's happened.        I hear the vice president would like very much to run and that he may be running, but it just seems to me if Hillary wants it, assuming nothing much happens with what we're all talking about for the last two weeks, that it will be Hillary on the Democratic side.  The Republicans, it's not quite as clear as to what's going to happen as of this moment and certainly Chris has not made any indication that he would be running.  He's going to be running for governor.  He's going to do very well on that race, I believe.  I think that should be an easy race for him but --        (CROSSTALK)      MORGAN:  If he did run, if he did run, Donald, would you -- would you see yourself endorsing him pretty quickly?        TRUMP:  Well, I have a great relationship with him.  I have a relationship with many of the people that we're talking about.  It's never easy, Piers, because I have a relationship with many of the people that we're talking about.        MORGAN:  Right.        TRUMP:  But we'll see how it all goes.  I mean, you know, Chris is somebody that I've known for a long time.  I've always backed him. And we'll see how things go.        MORGAN:  Donald Trump, always great to talk to you, thank you so much.        TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.        MORGAN:  We're learning more about NSA leaker Edward Snowden but it's only raising more questions about what kind of person he is.  A criminal profiler breaks down what we know so far.  That's coming next.        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      EDWARD SNOWDEN, LEAKED NSA DOCUMENTS:  The greatest fear that I have regarding the outcome for America of these disclosures is that nothing will change.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:  Confessed NSA leaker Edward Snowden speaking out while on the run.  The more we learn about his life the more questions there are about why somebody like him would take on the U.S. government like this.        To help us get inside the mind of Edward Snowden, Xavier Amador is a forensic psychologist and the founder of the Leap Institute.  And John Hermann is BuzzFeed's the tech editor.        And the reason we've got you in, John, is because you've unearthed all sorts of fascinating stuff about this guy.  Build me a picture of the kind of -- to me, somebody needy, needy, quite weird geek.  Am I overstating things?        JOHN HERRMAN, BUZZFEED TECH EDITOR:  He's definitely a geek.  I think one of the big things here is that since this information has come out, there have been two responses, there have been people who -- who see him as an increasingly weird and strange gamer, anime fan, you know, hacktivist type.  And then people who are kind of from the Internet who spend a lot of time on forums and online community who sort of recognized him as a type.        MORGAN:  What is that type?        HERRMAN:  He's a little bit of a know-it-all.  A little bit of a troll but also a guy with very strong convictions about privacy, about freedom of information, about government.        MORGAN:  You see, here's the thing, Xavier Amador, which I find slightly incongruous.  If you're such a great, you know, campaigner for privacy and everything else, why on earth would you go and work at the NSA?        XAVIER AMADOR, FOUNDER, LEAP INSTITUTE:  That's a great question. You know, we don't have a psychiatric psychological term of geek or know-it-all, but there is a kind of grandiosity that's coming across in his words, looking at his blogs, looking at things -- references he makes to his super hero cape and so on.        You know, I have top secret clearance.  People I know who have it, you take an oath, and you take an oath to keep a secret, even knowing full well that there may be things that you learn from the government that you're morally and ethically opposed to and that's a decision he had to make.        And so to think that he's acting purely out of some ethical concern, we're not talking about genocide here, as far as I'm -- as I know.  We're talking about maybe some very, very serious issues but he broke his oath.  And that says something about his personality or he's been compromised.        MORGAN:  Yes, I --        AMADOR:  Today the government announced -- suggesting he might have been compromised or he might be in fact involved in espionage. Those are the two scenarios I see.  An image for personality grandiosity or he's been compromised.  Something about his past has been --        MORGAN:  Right, I mean, John Herrman, looking at some of the stuff that you unearthed, I mean, his gaming name, Wolf King Awesome Fox.        HERRMAN:  Right.        MORGAN:  And you know, he used quite descriptive sex talk while -- referencing was to post-coital Krispy Kremes, and, et cetera, et cetera.        The kind of picture I got from what you unearthed about him was just, you know, he's -- he's a guy with a pretty big sense of his own importance in life but that importance in life was quite important in his little world, was nowhere near important enough for him to start making decisions about national security, was it?        HERRMAN:  Well, what's important to understand is that on this forum that he was posting on, it's very for tech geeks, for IT guys, he posted nearly 800 times.  He posted about all manners of things and he wasn't really -- first of all, he didn't expect this anonymous scrutiny in the future, although he must have known going into this that this could all be unearthed, but he was embodying a type that I think we're going to see more and more of as hacktivists kind of enter the mainstream.        MORGAN:  They're celebrity hacktivists.  I mean, Xavier Amador, that's what he is, I think.  I think he's looked to people like Bradley Manning and the others.  He's a bit of a loser by all accounts and he's gone for it, and thinks I'm going to make myself a global star, and a kind of hero figure, if you like.  And that's what I read into him at the moment from everything I'm gleaming.  But am I unfair to say that?        AMADOR:  No, I don't think you're unfair but then -- and that's one viable scenario for sure, looking at this as a psychologist, just as another person.  But the other has to do with him going go into this thinking he could keep a secret.  He was going to keep the secret and he has an immature personality.  He's impulsive.  And he hasn't had a security clearance that long.  He's a young guy.  It may have been a mistake giving him the clearance in the first place.  And there's another scenario which his he's been compromised.        MORGAN:  And also, quite bizarre, I think, Xavier, that he's just ditched his girlfriend, this beautiful girl that seems very intelligent, beautiful, and her father says they're all pretty shocked.        (CROSSTALK)      I'm looking at pictures of her now.  Even I would question the insanity just for leaving her.        AMADOR:  Look, I -- I've heard a lot of couples and a lot of people break up for a lot of reasons, so you may be reading -- you may have a crystal ball that I simply don't have.        (LAUGHTER)      MORGAN:  Finally, John, I mean, what is the reaction -- you know, from our community, the media world?  We all have our view taken from our positions but in the Internet world, it's your world, is he seen as more of a hero than a villain?        HERRMAN:  I think the Internet, at least types of communities he is a part of has been broadly sympathetic.  He's -- he's very much of the Internet.  He spent a lot of his formative years, in his 20s, posting on these forums, talking about games, hobbies, talking about his job, talking about his strange hours, his security clearance.        And I think a lot of people online, particularly young men see themselves in him.  They, you know, they see him as a type of almost hero that maybe they could relate to or be like.  So I think there is a gap between the broader public perception of who he is and what he did and the Internet's more narrow perception.        MORGAN:  Well, the mystery will continue until we get more of a sense of what his real motivation is for all this.  And I'm sure that will come out in the next few weeks.        John Herrman and Xavier Amador, thank you both very much.        Six months after the Sandy Hook massacre, victims' families meet with President Obama.  What did he say?  My conversation with two family members who met him.  That's next.       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The time it took for them to crawl, 10 months.  The time it took to run, two years.  The time it took to become a first grader, six years.  And in some states, the time it takes to buy a gun, 10 minutes.        Universal background checks won't save time.  But they will save lives.        (END VIDEO CLIP)      MORGAN:  A powerful message from Newtown Action Alliance.  As I mentioned earlier, tomorrow marks six months since the tragedy at Sandy Hook.  Twenty 1st graders and six educators died that day. Today President Obama sat down to meet with some of the family members.  It includes Jillian Soto who's Vicki Soto's sister and Teresa Rousseau, who's Lauren Rousseau's mother.  Both were teachers, of course, at Sandy Hook.        Welcome to you both.  Tell me first of all, if you may, Teresa, how did it go today in Washington, and in particular your meeting with the president?        TERESA ROUSSEAU, LAUREN ROUSSEAU'S MOTHER:  The president has been so supportive of our cause and we're more than happy to work with him and Vice President Biden in their effort to pass some commonsense gun legislation.        MORGAN:  Jillian, you know, I totally applaud the president and the vice president's rhetoric on all this.  What I find hard to deal with is the complete lack of any action at the end of it.  You must, as a group of families, feel pretty frustrated that here we are six months after this appalling atrocity which so terribly affected your families and nothing really has happened.        JILLIAN SOTO, VICKI SOTO'S SISTER:  I do feel frustrated at times but sitting down with the vice president and the president today I did feel -- you know, they talked to us, they told us, you know, it's going to take time but as long as we keep showing that we're not going anywhere, we'll keep fighting it, we're going to get somewhere.  And I'm confident in that.  I know it's taken six months for this talk to get as far as it has and it's not going to happen overnight that we're going to get universal background checks and assault rifle bans or lower magazine size.        It's going to take time.  But as long as we all stand together and continue to fight and not give up, not let the NRA win, we're going to get it.  We're going to get what we came here to fight for for the past six months.        MORGAN:  Teresa, you read out names today of many 4,800 Americans who've killed by guns since Newtown, a really staggering statistic. When you see as somebody who's been so close to a tragedy see on an almost daily basis more gun shootings -- there was a mass shooting last Friday in Santa Monica and every day casual violence taking people's lives.  How does it make you feel?        ROUSSEAU:  Well, it makes me feel very sad.  One of the saddest things at the beginning of our journey to this point in time was to visit the shrines that were the gifts and mementos that were sent to Sandy Hook and then to go home and read in the paper that Americans running out and buying guns in record numbers.  That was really, really heartbreaking.        I guess, the sad thing is that we know what those 5,000 people who have lost loved ones throughout the country since we lost our loved ones, we know the depth of their grief and the enormity of their grief and they are probably not getting all the comfort and support that we have.  So our hearts go out to them and we hope we can fix it.       MORGAN:  I mean, Jillian, it wasn't just any gun that Americans raced out to buy.  They were racing out to buy in record numbers the AR-15 assault rifle which was the very gun used at Sandy Hook to kill so many people.  What does that tell you about America right now?        SOTO:  It just shows you how screwed up this country has become and how you can see someone walk into an elementary school and use that gun to kill 20 6- and 7-year-olds, to look at them and not even care when you hear them scream, and just open fire, to look at six educators who are there to teach their kids, to teach them how to write and how to do multiplication and add.        To look at them and open fire on them, and Americans felt that they had to go out and buy these guns in large sizes and just go out and mass produce them and get them, and just shows how awful things are and how badly we need change, how badly we need to do something about this before another crazed man walks into an elementary school and opened fire or into a movie theater and opened fire or a supermarket, anywhere, we have to do something about it.        MORGAN:  Teresa, you know, we're six months into this battle, those of us who believe that something has to be done and there's only one reason why I feel so passionate about it, I want less Americans to be killed by guns.  Simple as that.  There is no other agenda that's being fought here other than to reduce the number of people who get killed by guns every single day in America.        What do you think it's going to take to persuade the people in Washington to actually take this more seriously than they have done so far?        ROUSSEAU:  Well, I just think more average Americans, though almost 90 percent that seem to agree with gun registration will speak up.  We need to talk to our lawmakers.  We need to send them e-mails. We need to call them on the telephone and let them know how we feel about this.  Maybe we need some more demonstrations.  Maybe we need to march on the capital.  Whatever it takes to make them aware that we are paying attention to what is happening in Washington.        MORGAN:  Well, I want to say, again, that both Lauren and Vicki were absolute heroines that day.  I'm sure the carnage could have been even worse if it wasn't for how brave they were in the face of a terrible (INAUDIBLE).  I thank you both, Teresa and Jillian, for joining me and I hope we can talk again as we continue collectively to try and get something done.  Thank you very much.        SOTO:  Thank you.        ROUSSEAU:  Thank you.        MORGAN:  And we'll be right back.        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      MORGAN:  The countdown is under way.  With just four days from the start of CNN's all new morning show, it's called ""NEW DAY.""  And with me on ""The Grill"" are the hosts of ""NEW DAY,"" Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan.        Welcome to ""The Grill.""        KATE BOLDUAN, HOST, CNN'S NEW MORNING SHOW ""NEW DAY"":  Well, thanks so much.  What are you serving up?        MORGAN:  I've been watching you two now for a few weeks.  I mean, I can't even get in an elevator at CNN here without seeing your huge pictures.        BOLDUAN:  We want to make sure you know.        MORGAN:  Biggest launch in --        (CROSSTALK)      How are you feeling?  In all honesty, it's a -- it's a huge new show.  Lot of pressure.        BOLDUAN:  Yes.        MORGAN:  Are you feeling the nerves?        BOLDUAN:  I think if I wasn't a little nervous I wouldn't be -- it wouldn't have a pulse.  But it's nerves of excitement.  We're ready to go.  It's more kind of the anxiety leading up that is what I think we're feeling.  I think -- I just -- want it to start.  I think we're ready to get this go on the road.        MORGAN:  I mean, I noticed -- because I launched 2 1/2 years ago.       BOLDUAN:  Right.        MORGAN:  And it was this huge buildup and you get sick of your own promos by the end.  But Chris, I mean, you're an experienced anchor guy.  This will, I guess, in the end be made or broke or perhaps by your chemistry.  And it seems on the face of it you get on great but, what's the most annoying thing about it?       CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN'S NEW MORNING SHOW ""NEW DAY"":  If you're right, and I hope you are, then we know already.  We're going to be fine.  Because I have the least question and I have the most confidence.        MORGAN:  Any faults of hers we could dwell on?        CUOMO:  I'll tell you what.        BOLDUAN:  List them out.  What are my faults?        (LAUGHTER)      CUOMO:  I'll tell you, I'll tell you.        BOLDUAN:  Well, if you've got --        (CROSSTALK)      CUOMO:  The real story of it, Piers --        MORGAN:  I keep hearing how great you are.  I want to read --        (CROSSTALK)      CUOMO:  If we could pretend that Kate can't hear us for a second.       (LAUGHTER)      I have to tell you, this has been hell on earth.        BOLDUAN:  Thank you.        CUOMO:  That's my fake angry, it's not working?        BOLDUAN:  Fake angry?        CUOMO:  I'll go higher with it.        BOLDUAN:  Try another.        CUOMO:  If I could tell you, Piers.  This has been great.  She's a friend in every sense of the word.  We get along great, and that is a blessing going into it.  My concern is that this is too much.  I'm tired of seeing my face.  I'm tired of talking about it.  I can't explain what the show is going to be about when it's about what happens tomorrow.  You know?  So as you have the frustration, so do I. I want to get after.  And I want to do the show because for me, as you know, and as it is for a lot of us it's all about the purpose of the job.        I want to get into it, I want to be relevant, I want to help people, and I want to do it day in and day out.  And we have a great team.  If anything happens other than success here, I've got to put it on my back because we have everything we need to succeed.       MORGAN:  You've come from another great network to CNN.  What is your impression of CNN?  What do you make of it as a network?  What is its unique selling points, do you think?        CUOMO:  Big is the word that comes to mind.        BOLDUAN:  Yes.        CUOMO:  Big personalities like you.  Big resources.  Big priorities.  There's a lot of manpower here.  And big responsibility. What you do is so much harder than what I'm used to doing.  That was the big growing pain for me coming here is, how am I going to do this for five hours when this story is developing in front of me?        MORGAN:  Because you were plunged right in.        CUOMO:  That's right.        BOLDUAN:  Exactly.        MORGAN:  You started before we knew it.  Suddenly the Boston bombings, the kidnapped girls were found, you know, great tornadoes lashing, and so on.  And suddenly you're literally up to your knees in this stuff.  I mean, I felt that what you brought to it, to our network was a real sense of passion for the people that were involved in those stories.        Is that something you've always tried to do?        CUOMO:  I believe that, you know, to be fair, I think that is the job.  I think most of us are doing it for the same reasons.  To me, I just believe that why I stay in it, because it's a hard life.  There are a lot of great benefits to this.  You know, if you're successful, you're well paid, you get to travel, it's great.        But you see a lot of dark things and you carry a lot of that with you.  I mean, I think what motivates me is that people need us.  They need us to be there to connect to what happens in the world emotionally and intellectually and to fight the fight.  You only get one chance to wake up in the morning.        MORGAN:  Well, also, I mean, Kate had all these (INAUDIBLE) working with Wolf in late afternoons, you know, strolling whenever you feel like it.  You know?        BOLDUAN:  Yes.  It was such a good job.        MORGAN:  Letting Wolf do most of the work.        BOLDUAN:  Of course.        MORGAN:  Laughing at his jokes, all that kind of thing.        BOLDUAN:  (INAUDIBLE).        MORGAN:  Now you're going to be starting on air at 6:00 a.m.       BOLDUAN:  I know, 12 hours earlier.        MORGAN:  That will test all your beauty products.        (LAUGHTER)      BOLDUAN:  Exactly.  This is not how I wake up in the morning.        MORGAN:  I mean, it is a brutal thing.  I know people in Britain who've done morning shows.  And I know some of you have done morning shows.  And it is very brutal.  Are you ready for this?  With the 4:00 a.m. alarm call every morning?        CUOMO:  Come on, tell him.  Tell him what you've been doing.        BOLDUAN:  I've been calling -- tell him, tell him, Kate.        CUOMO:  Wait.  I'll use the voice.  Tell him, tell him what you've been doing.        BOLDUAN:  Yes.  I only answer to that weird voice.        (LAUGHTER)      I am ready.  Because why am I ready?  Because it's a great job that I'm going to be waking up to and we're going to have a lot of fun doing it.        CUOMO:  And?        BOLDUAN:  But to get ready for it, I've been calling it my spring training.  We're very competitive, so I really want to be ready even earlier.  So I've been waking up extremely early.        MORGAN:  How early?        BOLDUAN:  I was waking up at 2:15.        MORGAN:  Are you serious?  You freak.        (LAUGHTER)      BOLDUAN:  It's ridiculous.  2:15, I wake up at 2:15.  And then when we start the show, I wake up at 2:45 or 3:00, it feels like Christmas.  I'm like sleeping in, I mean, it feels great so --        MORGAN:  You are apparently at 29 years old the youngest morning show anchor on any major TV network.        BOLDUAN:  I can only say that for one more month.        (LAUGHTER)      I don't know, because that -- I'm actually going to hit the big 3-0.        MORGAN:  Yes.  Oh well.        BOLDUAN:  (INAUDIBLE) after that.        CUOMO:  I've got shoes that are that old.        (LAUGHTER)      MORGAN:  Well, look, guys, I wish you all the very best.  ""NEW DAY"" premieres of course this Monday.  No one in the world is unaware of that fact.  June 17th, weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m.        Best of luck.        CUOMO:  Hey, look forward to seeing you on the show.        MORGAN:  Definitely.  Any time.        BOLDUAN:  Yes.  Like he's going to wake up that early.        MORGAN:  What time I'm going to get up --        (CROSSTALK)      (LAUGHTER)      Forget it.        CUOMO:  When you're in London.  When he's in London.        BOLDUAN:  Right.  London.        MORGAN:  We'll see.  We'll be right back.        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      MORGAN:  Tomorrow, a perfect trio for a Friday night.  I'll talk to Harry Connick Jr. about movies and music and what matters to him most.  Also the brash of very funny Russell Brand, a superstar comedian, all the stuff about his wild life and his high-profile romance.  Plus, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Much more than Miley's dad, as you'll see.

507971085,2013-06-29 13:29:35,Justice Dept. reviewing Supreme Court immigration decision: Lynch,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-immigration-idUSKCN0ZE2X5,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,immigration and refugees,illegal aliens,crime and criminals,international relations",4442,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Julia Edwards 3 Min Read PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court’s decision to block President Barack Obama’s plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. “We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,” Lynch told Reuters in an interview. Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court. She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House. In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a “tremendous problem.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits. Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government. “It is a matter of priority for us,” Lynch said. “When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.” Asked to comment on the impact of Britain’s decision at a referendum last week to leave the European Union, Lynch said the law enforcement relationships between the United States and both Britain and the European Union would remain strong. “We have very strong and positive relationship with law enforcement in the United Kingdom and, as of now, I do not see that changing in respect to the United Kingdom or the European Union,” Lynch said. Asked about changes that should be made in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando on June 12, Lynch did not say if the Justice Department or the Obama administration was working on more executive actions on gun control but would continue research on “smart-gun” technology. A smart gun is one that can only be fired by the authorized user, often by requiring a palm print, in order to prevent gun theft or accidental shootings. “That’s going to be a longer-term project. One of the things that we want to make sure is that people who do own guns lawfully have a way to make sure that their family members are safe in the house with them,” Lynch said the Justice Department is looking to see if the federal government can move smart-gun research forward, including on technology that can be used by the military. Lynch also said that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE emissions scandal.

Plane Took Seven Flights With Dead Stowaway In Wheel Well http://www.gadling.com/2013/06…..heel-well/ I’ve always wanted to travel Start working at home with Google! This is certainly the nicest-work I have ever done . Last Monday I got a new Alfa Romeo from bringing in $7778. I started this 9 months ago and practically straight away started making more than $83 per hour. I work through this link, Bling6.com Was the stowaway named Bernie by any chance? No, Johnny Matrix. ha! The United States will send military assistance to the rather motley assortment of rebels in Syria… “If you have to use these weapons on any 14-year-old blasphemers, try to keep it off the news, guys.” So the government is supplying weapons to al Qaeda, but they need to continue to spy on every American with a cell phone to prevent terrorism? You have to be an Ivy grad to understand. Or just be one of the sheep who will say how necessary both spying on Americans and arming future terrorists are. http://www.dailycal.org/2013/0…..l-debates/ This guy is so dumb that I suspect he’s actually pro-gun and is writing the most retarded gun control talking points ever. If we hold this amendment to be all-powerful, then we should also give equal weight to the amendment following it: Soldiers cannot be quartered in your homes. I’m sure we all struggle with that problem day to day. Uh…good point, dude. Everything in the Bill of Rights should be considered so comically beyond what the government would ever do as the Third Amendment is. I find it kind of strange that the 3rd is actually treated correctly, given the way they rest of them are. Give them time It will start with just giving them lemonade and people will think libertarians are crazy to resist. So….how nice is your home, should someone be…um, quartered there? Stocked fridge and plenty of Scotch? Did it post-Katrina. Considering that money for the DOD is a big chunk of your overall tax bill, you are quartering troops, just not in your actual home. Most of that is for materiel, not personnel. But your statement would be equally true for any military of any size. It’s just that it’s constitutionally not the same thing since funding military forces is explicitly authorized in I.8 while the specific act of requiring civilians to keep troops in their homes during peacetime is forbidden. Not verbotten just restricted to owner agreement and compensation. I have told the story before on here but it is cool so I will repeat it: Some years ago (90s I think) the silo boys doing minuteman duty were caught in a real bad blizzard (either WY or NE) and the local farmers took them in for a day or two and fed them as a caring gesture. When the storm was gone a Col came by and paid each farmer who had done that the equivalent hotel rate going in the nearest towns for each person and day. Most farmers wanted to refuse the money, just doing their duty etc., but the Col said nope 3rd Amendment states this pretty clearly. It’s not. The reason the government would want to station troops in a private home isn’t that they’re too lazy to build barracks, it’s because back before the age of federal law enforcement and telecommunications, putting a soldier in someone’s home was how the government kept tabs on what they were up to. The soldier was see when they came and went, who the met with, what was said, etc. and report it back to his superiors. The third amendment is properly understood as a ban on government surveillance, and is just as abused as every other amendment in the Bill of Rights. Well that and the fact that there was a problem with the Brits forcing colonists to house soldier because they were an army not on their continent. Im using that, I will give you full credit. Obligatory That’s possible, though I have seen people actually make the “use of a car” = “owning a gun” argument. 1. Gun control doesn’t work. Anyone who knows how to use Google can disprove this argument. It’s common knowledge that the states with the most stringent gun control policies hold lower rates of gun violence than states with the least control. I love when liberals try to make this argument, because in reality the only thing correlated with crime is the number of low income black men in an area. States with lots of gun control which have tons of low income black men have a good amount of crime. The same is true of States without much gun control. That’s why California (LOTS OF GUN CONTROL!) has so much more crime than Vermont (Very little gun control!). It’s also why a lot of Southern States give liberals the superficial impression that gun control works. The South has a lot more black people, which means that their crime rate is bound to be higher because the group that commits a lot of the crime makes up a larger percentage of the population. That sounds like a very American thing to say. No, because I’m saying it because it’s factually accurate and not because I think black people are inherently inferior. There are many reasons for it, most of them cultural, but it is a fact that a much higher percentage of crimes are committed by African Americans. Therefore places with larger percentages of black people tend to have more crime. It’s a fact that can be proven with virtually any crime statistics. Nah, we have to deny the facts so we don’t appear racist. That’s the best way to look at the world: through a gauzy veil of good feelings and hand wringing. Don’t deny the facts, but it is good to point out that it is not something inherent about black people, but the result of historical and cultural accident. Too many people will think that it’s racist to simply state the facts about crime rates and race and I, at least, prefer not to make it too easy for those people. Most are probably morons who won’t think about the issue with any nuance, but some people can be reached. Yes, I agree. I should have said that in my first post. For my part, I think a large portion of the problem is the decay of black families brought on by the welfare state and the violence bred by the war on drugs. I obviously wasn’t trying to say anything racist, despite Shrike’s apparent belief that I am in favor of denying the franchise to black people. Also, a lot of things that correlate to race in the US will also strongly correlate with income/poverty. I think it is important to look at that along side race when discussing things like this. Committed by or convicted of? But your remedies are racist. Denying blacks the right to vote, poll taxes, etc. What the fuck are you talking about? I have never said anything about denying black people the right to vote or the creation of poll taxes. You are the biggest lying scumbag in the universe. You’re GOP – that is your MO. HAhahahahahahahaha Bull Connor and George Wallace were Democrats, as were the Byrds of Virginia. I’m so Republican that I consistently argue against war, the surveillance state, the drug war and military spending. Also, point to a single active Republican who believes in the reinstatement of the poll tax. I’ll wait. Well, I am not a fucking progressive either – but you fuckers falsely claim it. Like I am the only classic liberal who voted Obama in 2008? I am honest to say the least. Yeah, you’re a classic, all right. A classic crusty sock. You voted for the fucker last year too, asshole. You aren’t a progressive. You’re an authoritarian statist. You’re GOP – that is your MO. RevDrMLK was GOP too. Look it up. Irish, Virginian, and LFOD, Shriek is changing the topic on you to get his jollies. He wants you to defend the GOP, he enjoys it. Waste no time defending the GOP on this, just tell him to fuck off and ignore him from that point on. Noted. Fuck off, Sockpuppet. But your remedies are racist. Denying blacks the right to vote, poll taxes, etc. You fucking louse, please go drop dead. You ought to know by now he’s a fucking progressive troll – ignore him. God I miss MNG Celebrate diversity! Uh, CA doesn’t actually have a high percentage of blacks (7.2% of the population, compared to latinos at 37.6% or Asians at 14.9%) I would say its not *blacks* per se but rather having large areas of low income people. ‘Cuz yah do sound kinda racist. Granted – 7.2% is huge compared to VT’s .76% (I never thought that any state was that white) but for you’re hypothesis to stand you’d have to show that blacks are so much more likely to commit crimes that they can meet or beat what latinos do with 5 times the numbers. No reason it can’t be both to some degree, just as there’s no reason to judge individual people differently based on this information. If you start crossing the street to avoid black people because of the correlation that’s racist behavior based on racist ideas, but acknowledging a correlation is not by itself racist. It’s common knowledge that the states with the most stringent gun control policies hold lower rates of gun violence than states with the least control. Look at Australia: In the aftermath of a mass shooting in 1996, Australia enacted sweeping gun control, including an assault weapons ban and increased background checks. How many mass shootings have occurred since then? You got it. 0 That’s cute. Now what are the rates of violence, including the use of other or no weapons? Or perhaps being beaten to death makes you less dead than being shot to death? That’s cute. Now what are the rates of violence, including the use of other or no weapons? Or perhaps being beaten to death makes you less dead than being shot to death? This! I have almost bruised my head facepalming. In one argument I was in, the guy kept pointing out how gun violence had gone down in countries with no guns. When I pointed out that those same countries levels of ALL crime, especially violent crime, had skyrocketed, I was met with “yeah, but less gun violence”. Seriously, these people can’t see that it doesn’t matter to the victims that they were beaten to death, or were victims of a crime that otherwise wouldn’t have occurred. It’s perfectly fine for the rape statistics to skyrocket. It’s just dandy if assaults, muggings, etc go up. Just so long as nobody has a gun. “countries with no guns” It also helps to point out there’s no such thing. Mass killings still happen in the land down under: Childers Palace Fire – In June 2000, drifter and con-artist Robert Long started a fire at the Childers Palace backpackers hostel that killed 15 people. Monash University shooting – In October 2002, Huan Yun Xiang, a student, shot his classmates and teacher, killing two and injuring five. (Sounds like more than zero shootings since 1996.) Churchill Fire – 10 confirmed deaths due to a deliberately lit fire. The fire was lit on 7th of February 2009. Quakers Hill Nursing Home Fire – 10 confirmed and as many as 21 people may have died as a result of a deliberately lit fire in a Quakers Hill nursing home. The fire was lit early on 18th of November 2011. Florida Man, Arrested Picking Mushrooms In State Forest With Alligator In His Backpack  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/…..28110.html Wildlife officials arrested five men in the Little Econ State Forest in Seminole County Sunday after an officer found them with magic mushrooms, marijuana and an alligator in a backpack, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman Joy Hill. Hill said the group was stopped for picking hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms, which grow naturally in the forest. But during a search, an officer discovered a 2-foot alligator wrapped in a bandana and stuffed into the backpack of 30-year-old Titusville resident Rick Myers. God forbid people should want to alter their brain chemistry in ways the State doesn’t approve of. How dare he harvest that which grows naturally I suppose gators do grow naturally. Actually, the ‘shrooms were legal. The pot and gators weren’t. Then why were they stopped? His backpack was trying to slither away? Scruffy wants to GAMBOL!!! Titusville! My parents’ stomping grounds, holla! Wait a second – Since those mushrooms are illegal, the state forest is clearly a grow operation, and the “wildlife officials” and everyone else in the chain of command for park administration, right up to the governor, should be arrested today. That’s how they’d treat me if they found pot growing on my property. So fuck ’em, burn them all and shoot their fucking dogs. Speaking of dogs, I was at the vet 2 days ago and they were getting ready to put down a pit bull that had mauled a cat to death. The dog has never hurt a human, just other animals. I knew none of this when I walked in, I just saw the dog, who seemed to be a nice dog, so I naturally asked the dog, “How you doing?” It would have taken a court order for this to happen, but I question the court’s decision. Pssh. I put this up days ago. The House voted to restrict (but not eliminate) the president’s power to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens. Where were they on NDAA? New York cab driver reportedly dies after being stabbed in eye with umbrella Read more:  http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013…..z2WCAM19ps Look for a short, fat, white man with a monocle and top hat. Thank god it wasn’t a gun! We need strict umbrella control laws. And the best part is, umbrella ownership isn’t protected by the constitution, so it should be easy! Actually it is (maybe). When used that way, an umbrella is an “arm”, I think. I should point out that a person only needs one umbrella in their possession since that’s the maximum number they can use legitimately. We need to legislate these quick release grips. No one needs to open their umbrella in less than 1 second. Plus they look scary. America’s Worst Charities “I want to work at a non-profit, not some icky corporation.” Did you notice how many of them are police organizations? Yep. I get calls at least once a week from police fundraisers. Usually some we’re taking the kids to Walmart to buy school supplies bullshit. I get calls from the Reserve Police Officers Association, or something like that. What the hell is a reserve police officer? Like military reserves – (usually) volunteer cops that can be called up when more cops are need on short notice/short term. Yes, some of the worst ones. National Narcotic Officers Associations Coalition paid out 4M to the people who brought in 4.8M and paid out nothing in direct cash aid. I assume the other 800K was eaten by admin costs. Seriously, get rid of either corporate taxes or non-profit status. Just get rid of corporate taxes. See the Fox News op ed below about the 60 year history of the IRS going after any church that didn’t tow the President’s lion. Yep. And if you get rid of corporate taxes you can raise cap gains/dividend rates back up to full income tax rates without a double taxation problem. Of course, I still have a problem with any income tax at all. Another possibility is to make C-corps pass thru entities. It might be too complicated though. And once again, I still have a problem with any income tax at all. Dammit, rob, you’re no libertarian! You want to raise taxes! BURN HIM!!!! “He turned me into a newt!” “Well I got better.” Get rid of both. They need to supplement the money they make from confiscating property. Yeah, but you can work at a non-profit for ten years and get your student loans forgiven. That’s can be a huge incentive for someone who went to a top tier school. We’re talking an extra 10-20k$ per year. Oh I know it. I think it’s utter bullshit. The government is making a value judgement on your choice of employment and distorting the market at the same time. Qualifying employment is any employment with a federal, state, or local government agency, entity, or organization or a non-profit organization that has been designated as tax-exempt by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The type or nature of employment with the organization does not matter for PSLF purposes. Additionally, the type of services that these public service organizations provide does not matter for PSLF purposes. My sister has this as a pretty big factor in her job hunt, and she’s going to (obviously) take the option which pays back the least over 10 years, because she doesn’t have to care about the interest piling up. “United States Deputy Sheriffs’ Association”? “Reserve Police Officers Association”? “National Narcotic Officers Associations Coalition”? Why the hell would anybody want to donate to any of these? Somehow I get the impression that the fund solicitors are actually the police themselves. God, whenever I hear some high schooler or college student say they want to work at a non profit it drives me up the wall. Feeeeeeeelings… nothing more than feeeeeeelings….. My company is absolutely for profit. If I had to guess, I would say it’s made our owner a bit over a billionaire. And yet I am having trouble coming up with more than a couple nonprofits that have done more good (i.e. improved peoples lives somehow) than ours has via our software. Absent cronyism, profit is a direct measure of the value you’ve added to the world. I thought it was a direct measure of how evil and exploitative you have been. That’s how liberals justify their lack of talent and ambition. I dont think that holds. Lets take a hypothetical example. Company A sells 1000 widgets at a $10 per widget profit. Company B sells 1000 widgets at same quality & price as A, but makes $20 per widget profit. Company A provides value of $10000 + 1000 widgets Company B provides value of $20000 + 1000 widgets The extra profit is extra value provided to the world, but its an incomplete picture. So then company B must be more efficient, meaning it is using up fewer resources (raw materials, energy, or labor) from the world. Though I guess they could also just be smarter at purchasing their required components. I don’t think it’s a perfect 1:1 correlation, but generally more profit means more value to the world. I don’t think it’s a perfect 1:1 correlation, but generally more profit means more value to the world. I agree with that, my example has B being $10k more valuable. Its just the value of the service provided adds to the world too, not just the profit. Something about Company B’s process allowed them to profit more. Maybe they used fewer hours of labor or cheaper equipment/labor or something. That’s where the difference comes in. They used fewer resources to do the same job, so more value was added. They used fewer resources to do the same job, so more value was added. Can people not read? Of course its more value added, I fucking said that. $20k + 1000 widgets  $10k + 1000 widgets Its not a “direct measure” though. I think it is a direct measure, though. Company B has twice the profits, so they added twice the value. At least it is the closest we can come to a direct measure given the subjective nature of “value”. Expanding on my comment at 11:27: Consider Company C that makes 1000 widgets at 0$ profit. They have added 0 value to world. Instead they have merely converted one thing of value into another. Consider Company C that makes 1000 widgets at 0$ profit. They have added 0 value to world. Instead they have merely converted one thing of value into another. False. The purchaser got something they valued greater than their money, a widget. If the widget cost them $10 and the consumer got $15 of value out of it, they company C added $15000 worth of value to the world. THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY TRADE You are leaving off the other side. So using my consumer side example: A had a total value added of $25k ($10k+$15k) B had a total value added of $35k C had a total value added of $15k While the profit still represents part of the value added, whether it is a small part or a large part depends on the other side of the trade. Reading robc beats Khan Academy any day. While the profit still represents part of the value added, whether it is a small part or a large part depends on the other side of the trade. I agree. I was always assuming that these companies were actually able to find buyers for their products at the given profit level and that the companies negotiated the highest price they could get for their product. I never said that the profit measured in dollars was the whole value added, only that it was a direct measure of the value added. The total value added is twice the dollar profit if you assume that the two sides met in the middle when negotiating price. You are leaving off the other side. No, I’m assuming that, in a free market, parties meet at the middle when assessing value. If one side feels the other side is getting a better deal than they are they will raise their price. In reality Company C would not sell at 0 profit. They would raise their price. If their product could only sell at 0 profit, then they would know that they were adding no value to the world. In reality Company C would not sell at 0 profit. What if Company C is a non-profit org? Or a startup who cant yet compete with A or B on efficiency? In my assumption, Im assuming A B and C are all selling at the same price. As the product is basically a commodity, with no difference in quality, there is no pricing difference, so they have all selling at FMV. They just vary in their efficiency/cost control. “Consider Company C that makes 1000 widgets at 0$ profit. They have added 0 value to world. Instead they have merely converted one thing of value into another.” This can’t be serious. Let’s say that Company Z makes identical widgets via an identical process for identical cost but charges twice as much. Are we really to say that they “added more value” to the world? If we look at the lesson of the broken windows fallacy it’s conceivable that they took value away since the purchaser has less money to buy other things he wanted. All that profit for the producer could be seen as wasted cost for the consumer. It all depends on your point of view. We also don’t know what the company considers cost or profit. If I’m self-employed and I charge a flat $1,000 per hour for my labor I can reasonably say that my firm has made no profit (since all I bill are my labor “costs”), but (if I can get work at those rates) I’m doing just fine. If I’m self-employed and I charge a flat $1,000 per hour for my labor I can reasonably say that my firm has made no profit… Your firm has made no profit, but you have profited by $1000. That’s about half the value you add to the world per hour for each hour that you work at those rates. Your firm is just a go-between that adds no value (hence no profit). You’re changing the definitions of cost and profit. If you want to say that the $1000 per hour I make is all profit for me, then you have to do the same for the labor costs for Company C – their workers all “profit” from their wages. And the workers, absent some sort of company store scheme, certainly do have more money than they started with. So it’s equally valid to say that Company C has generated profit, just not for the shareholders (assuming there are pure shareholders). Are we really to say that they “added more value” to the world? Company Z would not be able to sell those widgets at that price. If someone was willing to buy their product at that price, then there must be some other value in their product over the other companies that your aren’t considering. Maybe it’s something as simple as the value of time or convenience. You can’t postulate a company that sells at zero profit and then accuse me of being unrealistic. You can’t postulate a company that sells at zero profit and then accuse me of being unrealistic. I wasn’t. I said that if someone was willing to buy from Z at a huge markup, then some other value must be added even though the product is identical to everyone else’s. I just said you have to consider all sides of the transaction. I already agreed that the 0 profit company was unrealistic, so let me replace it with a 0.01$ per widget profit company. This company adds vanishingly small value to the world compared to the other companies. Happy now? If what you’re saying is that achievable profit is a measure of the value that the customer places on the product above its cost of production and delivery, then I can get on board with that. But I absolutely disagree that it measures some sort of objective value to the world, because there is no such thing as objective value. …because there is no such thing as objective value. Agreed. Profit is the best measurement we have for value added though. There’s a fudge factor in there, but I think it is safe to say that if you make twice the profit, then you added twice the value. You can’t do this calculation with bartering, of course. Profit is the best measurement we have for value added though On one side only. On the other side, we have to measure the benefit the consumer gained before we get total value added. You continue to ignore that portion. You are saying that a non-profit never adds value to the world, and that is bullshit. I did the fucking math above, why is it so hard to understand? rob’s grumpy today. You REALLY want to twist your noodle, try intuitively understanding why the Radford POW camp is so amazing and generates wealth in a vacuum. I must have gone over it 10000 times and still feel as if I only “get it” just barely. rob’s grumpy today.

A new tax must be created to punish both companies. Charities have their place, but I think it is absolutely true that far more good has been done for humanity through people trying to make money (greed if you like) and building successful companies than from all the altruism and charity ever. I know this is obvious to most people here, but it is amusing (or sad perhaps) to see some people’s reaction when I point that out. I’ve worked for several companies that were non-profits. Not that we weren’t trying really hard to make money…. Hey they aren’t all bad, I had a friend who worked for 10 years at a non profit that trained high school kids how to build robots and then organized and ran robotics competitions for them, but then again who wouldn’t want a job where you get paid to play with Lego Mindstorms all day?

Mac ‘n Cheese can only ever be adequate, or bad. That’s a pretty unenlightened point of view. I’m guessing you don’t live in the south, or have never had lobster mac ‘n’ cheese. Yeah. I’ve made some pretty killer mac n cheese before. Maybe he’s unaware or unprocessed home cooked food? Or just never had actual homemade mac and cheese. Or we all just got trolled. I just realized his name is “DontShootMe”, so he probably knew what an incendiary remark he was making. Curses! Sorry, I’d rather have a good hamburger any day. My Mom made very good Mac ‘n Cheese, but at the end of the day, it’s cheese and pasta. I’d rather make my BBQ pulled chicken… This. It’s not just cheese and pasta, it’s a fucking side dish.

Except the one year when I was living in DC and my parents came to visit. Meat Medley. Mmmm….Meat Medley *Homer Simpson drool* My son in law used to manage a restaurant that had ‘Pasta El Diablo’. It was mac and cheese… from GOD! A combination of quality cheeses(asiago, parmesan, that mexican white stuff) and spices. And it could be got with fajita beef, chicken, or shrimp. Sort of a mexitalian melange of deliciousness. They’d serve it on one of those giant italian style pasta plates; I’d eat it until I hurt myself. Sorry, I’d rather have a good hamburger any day. What about a mac ‘n’ cheese stuffed hamburger? Because I’ve done that before and it was AWESOME. ooh, spice up Mac ‘n Cheese with a gigantic insect that eats dead stuff on the ocean floor.

Patty and Millicent Hill Finally, some realistic birthday-themed episodes of tv shows will be shown on 2nd-tier cable stations. http://www.foxnews.com/opinion…..n-targets/ The IRS long, sorry history of harassing political dissent. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest proponents of using the IRS to go after critics of the government was LBJ. This whole thing is making the economic arguments against a VAT seem less convincing. Fuck it, close down the IRS and set up a VAT. I don’t like VATs but I think one would actually be better than the ridiculous, labyrinthine tax code we currently have. One of the first things we should do is find a way to simplify the tax code. That would stop things like this from happening. I can’t stand the VAT. But I am starting to think we have no other choice. The problem is that most VAT proponents want to add it on top of the current BS. Why not just a sales tax instead some crazy supply-chain nonsense. This. VAT is extraordinarily complicated and a mild nightmare for manufacturers. Is the flat tax proposal of a few years back a dead letter with libertarians? The VAT looks like a real nightmare. To me, a flat tax is vastly referable to a VAT. In addition to the implementation headaches of VAT, it leaves the door wide open for more engineering of the tax code by politicians. Your and my bug is a lot of people’s feature. I tend to agree. I’m in favor of a true post-card flat tax that includes capital gains and dividends. But we’ll simply never get there, as the need to audit the return won’t go away, and the incentive to tweak is enormous. But you’d need a repeal of the 16th to make a VAT truly palatable…and that will never happen either. We’re well and truly fucked. Not to sound like a broken record, but we always have the option of sending each state a bill in proportion to representation in Congress, and letting them figure out how to actually get the funds. Would introduce competition and laboratories of democracy and all, but it couldn’t become a race to the bottom (as the opposition might worry about) because they have a fixed target to raise. It would also mitigate complaints that residents of small states unfairly get more representation due to the Senate, since they will also be paying more taxes for the privilege. Any form of sales tax would be better than an income tax. Which would be easier to implement and enforce? A retail sales tax or a VAT? The VAT has to be collected at more sources, but might be harder to evade… You’ll have to repeal the 16th Amendment. Good luck with that. Why do you have to repeal it? I can think of numerous examples where the government ignores the other ones. You’d have to repeal it because if they can have an income tax, they will. It doesn’t require an income tax, but can you imagine a congress that could collect income tax but didn’t? “You’ll have to repeal the 16th Amendment” No you wouldn’t. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. Nothing mandatory in it. You wouldn’t have to in any absolute sense. But practically, I think you would. Doesn’t seem too tough to repeal an Amendment. Apparently the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th and 10th were repealed a while back, judging from the news. I’d go with a VAT or sales tax or just about anything over an income tax of any kind. Even if the same level of taxation happened, those other taxes don’t require you to disclose your income and employment details to the government. Unless you’re running a business. Poll tax. Solves many problems at once. Poll tax What could be more equal than one man, one vote, one TAX? Exactly. We could even call it “your right to contribute to society”. How about ten thousand dollars per vote? Vote as often as you like, or not at all. But the IRS will never be closed down, and we will get a VAT plus an income tax. I wish what we’d get out of this is the “4th,5th & 16th amendment Clarification Act”. State that the 4th amendment prohibits withholding, because govmt needs a warrant to see your paycheck. Clarify that it’s perfectly legal to sign your tax form every year with “I plead the 5th”. And that that in no way provides any proof/suspicion/probable cause that you aren’t paying the income tax. Any cases where pleading the 5th does lead to extra attention will henceforth result in the CEA (constitional enforcment agency) investigating the people responsible, as individuals, for Federal Civil Rights violations. Clarify that while the 16th amendment does allow the income tax, it in no way authorizes an employment tax. Also clarify that the employee portion of the SS/Medicare/FICA is an income tax, and that is the only reason it is constitutional at all, but the employer portion is unconstitutional and therefore null and void, and therefore the “self employment” tax violates the equal protection clause of the 14th, and is therefore also null and void. The 4th and 5th amendments are already abundantly clear. Stop writing bills to clarify things that are already clear, and start indicting the officials who violate them. Pennsylvania police seek person who shot 550-pound bear out of season Read more:  http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013…..z2WCAZUo4E What are the odds they catch the guy? I’d be pissed about that. I live in the woods and have a few hillbilly neighbors who I suspect are regular poachers of deer, turkey, and small game. It’s not that I believe they should respect the hunting license regime in PA, it’s that they are 1 screwing with the normal reproductive cycle of the animal populations and 2 getting away with blatantly flouting the law for unknown reasons. These people have serious criminal tendencies including theft (running a chop shop at their compound) and arson. The police know it and claim to not be able to do anything about it and yet they spend all their time pulling people over for burned out taillights. Well duh. Armed hillbillies running a chop shop might decide to shoot it out rather then go to court. Some guy with a busted taillight will bitch and moan and pay the ticket. It’s all about officer safety. Anybody who kills more deer in PA is a hero. Death to Bambi! Deer are a plague and need to be exterminated to the point of extinction. Screwing up their reproduction cycle should be the plan. Man, when that deer raped you, the emotional damage was pretty severe. Deer have only raped my financially – thanks to the 2 car hoods they destroyed. make yourself happy But deer are delicious! I paid almost $30 a pound for my last one ($1000 deductible on my car). I’ll eat deer, but I would take cow over deer any day of the week. Some people say they like bear, too, but they’re fucking crazy. @crashland A-fucking-men! I live in pittsburgh and can see downtown from my house. My garden was recently decimated (literally as about 1/10 was destroyed) by fucking deer. If I were not in the city, I’d fucking shoot them on sight and not think twice about it. I don’t even know where these fucking things live, there’s no woods around here. +1 understanding what decimated means This is what happens when you exterminate the wolves and dont pick up their slack cause deer are “cute” in Town and Country, MO (wealthy liberals) they had a herd of over 500 deer…look on google maps at Town & Country, i will wait, Now, imagine 500 deer. And see all those limited access 4 lane roads with speeds of 60mph…yeah So anyway, they decided to “thin” the herd. Residents wanted catch and release in a rural area. First cost estimate was the city budget for a year. No shit. City said “Nahh, we’ll just shoot half and move half” nice compromise. Several bow hunters were tasked with crawling all over the city killing deer in peoples yards. funny. @db Isn’t it amazing that in small towns there are these families of criminals (most of them on ssi, “crazy checks”) that are always in trouble but never seem to go to jail. My dad had problems with a couple families like this that were his tenants. They stole and vandalized his property but the police just couldn’t do a thing about it gosh darnit. We were always reading in the paper about them being arrested for fraud, prescription forging, assault, shoplifting, etc but none of them ever spent more than a few days in jail. A couple of the kids finally went to jail when they were caught with a massive amount of heroin and cash. One of the neighbors referenced above is currently in prison for beating up his GF for about the twentieth time. Two years ago he was up on kidnapping charges but the abductee (his cousin) at the last minute refused to testify and the charges were dropped. You know who else hunted large mammals to extinction during a period of global warming? The supremes have cooked up a new regulation banning demonstrations on their turf. Constitutional experts. The Supremes must be using that power to create laws given to them in the Constitution They wanted to make sure Obama didn’t come down to where they work after Alito’s performance at the SOTU. Yeah, this is disappointing. Granted, protesting SCOTUS is pretty pointless, but its still the right of the people to protest. If they’re gonna screw up starting with the 1st Amendment, just impeach them all and shut down the Court for good.

Ticks That Spread Red-Meat Allergy  http://online.wsj.com/article/…..53308.html Odd as it seems, researchers say that bites from the voracious lone star tick are making some people allergic to red meat?even if they’ve never had a problem eating it before. I suspect genetic experimentation by crazed vegans. One day it’s very, VERY likely that some douchebag researcher somewhere will think he’s discovered an “empathy virus” or some such shit and will try to develop an animal vector to spread it. This is the kind of shit you worry about when you read too much science fiction. I see a future: Red Meat is Unhealthy, therefore we should stop people from eating it – using a drug taken from the saliva of a tick. Or maybe they could spray it out of airplanes and tell people it was just “condensation”. chemtrailxz!!!11 Read White Plague by Frank Herbert.

AT WILL Suck it up. “Should” got nothing to do with it. DUE PROCESS. Learn what it means. Let her protect herself by carrying concealed at school. I think a private employer can decide to release someone for whatever reasons they want. They felt it was in their best interest to let her go. It sucks for her, but sometimes bad shit happens. It’s legal, but it shows how serious the Catholic church takes all its teachings. “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” — James 1:27 Fuckers. Don’t think of it as a Catholic school, but rather a private school that caters to Catholics. That said, she can make an impassioned plea to the congregation and parents. As a parent, I’d be pretty pissed if a school fired my child’s (good) teacher because her ex-husband is an abusive douchebag who showed up on school property.

Poet puts testicles up for sale  http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewe…..-for-sale/ A Colombian poet and journalist has offered his testicles for sale to fund a trip to introduce Europeans to his work.

Because Lerner is a fanatic. I would bet anything she thought the people in the Cincinnati office would be proud to be one of the eggs broken for the cause. Apparently Lerner’s reputation at the FEC was one of an utter fanatical dogged determination to prove that her targets were guilty of wrongdoing, and that nothing any of her coworkers could say would divert her from her crusade. I suspect that she got away with it by being a bully, and that she could get away with it so long as there wasn’t a great deal of scrutiny on her actual actions.

Answering Michael Lind’s Question: Why Is No Country Libertarian? I have a question for Michael Lind: if losing weight is so great for your health, why are you such a fat ass? It is only important for the little people to follow the rules. Now excuse Mr. Lind, he has his late breakfast to attend to. By “late breakfast”, you mean the breakfast that he has between breakfast and lunch? Lind is a Hobbit? Yes That’s called secondsies in hobbit talk. Damn, I need to refresh more. No no, it’s second breakfast, then elevensies. I just recalled that myself. Silly me trying to short change both second breakfast and elevensies by combining the two. Lind has posted two follow-ups thus far, and he calls out Will Wilkinson in one of them for rebutting him (Wilkinson, the not-libertarian). WW’s twitter responses: (1): “Jesus what an idiot” and (2): “This is one of those rare occasions when I feel justified in saying my interlocutor is either dumb or dishonest.” I’d say the intellectual discourse has devolved. I won’t post the links to the Lind articles, because at this point it’s basically just inane click-bait. And if you think the articles are bad, wait till you read the comments. The words “weapons-grade stupid” come to mind… Sometimes you just have to give up any pretense of propriety and call it like it is. I believe that’s game, set and match. Well done. I like this response better. I like this response better. Here’s another answer to Lind that I liked. Kinda rambly, but informative and epically correct. And yes, the real reason there have never been a libertarian country has something to do with Lind’s chins. Prison Library At Guantanamo  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06……html?_r=0 David Remes, a lawyer for Guant?namo detainees, told me one client requested romance novels, while others have asked for skiing, surfing and mountain-climbing magazines, “because they never see nature.” His client Shaker Aamer, a former resident of Britain, took a liking to George Orwell. “I sent him a copy of ‘1984,’ and he said he read it about three times and that it perfectly captured the psychological reality of being at Gitmo,” Remes said. Books are screened out if they include too much profanity, anti-American or extremist themes, or “too much sex and violence,” Milton said. Still, “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” made it through the filter. What could be more anti-American than 1984? Orwell clearly wrote it as a critique of the Obama administration. We’ll know for certain when an anti-Obama movie comes out like the anti-Bush movie about modern fascism (V for Vendetta) did 10 years ago. It already did, shriek. or “too much sex and violence,” Milton said. Still, “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” made it through the filter Uh…someone is not filtering very well.

Those clowns have been sucking neocon cock for decades. Novak and Will – two neocon stalwarts at Newsweek. And that certainly makes it okay for Obama to use the Patriot Act 10 times more than Bush. And, right on cue. Two of…how many? Thanks for that, now I have to go get paper towels to clean up, and refill my coffee cup. They’ve definitely got a government cock lodged in their craw.

Communism was tried and failed. Libertarianism has never even been tried.” What an odd standard. You know what else is a complete failure? Time travel. After all, it’s never succeeded anywhere! What’s so striking about the Lind standard is how thoroughly conservative it is. Pick a date in the past, and you can imagine someone asking similar questions. “Why should women have equal rights?” some court intellectual surely asked. “Show me anywhere in the world where that has been tried.” Before that, “Give the peasants the right to vote? Unheard of!” Goldberg is a very sharp writer. And my God Lind is an embarrassment. You know who’s more of an embarrassment? The idiots who decide to publish him. You know who’s more of an embarrassment than the idiots who publish him? The idiots who read him. It is idiots all the way down. But has giving woman equal rights or peasant the right to vote been successful? I guess it depends on what you consider to be success. OK, back that up to “Men other than landowners having the right to vote? Where has that ever been tried?” ” Sweden’s social democracy is all right, but if it were perfect, I suspect fewer cars would be on fire over there.” nice. I’m actually not a full-blown libertarian myself Hand back the decoder ring.

Most people in Somalia wouldn’t be able to afford guns. Almost no government, and every man is his own sovereign, typically exercising what one might call their “2nd Amendment rights. They don’t have one government, they have many government in the form of their multiple tribes and clans to whom they owe their obedience.

That’s the sound of LIBERTARIAN PARADISE, my friend. This one makes my head hurt: The problem with the libertarian idea is that most self-described libertarians are complete kooks who are incapable of using any judgment. Thus, they advocate anarchy rather than a space in which civilized people can live with some comfort and security and a large sphere of freedom in which to make their own choices of what kind of lives to live. And they advocate policies (or “non-policies”) that even they admit are unworkable under present circumstances but wave away problematical present circumstances with a grand sweep of their hand, even though there is no path to get from here to there. A great example of flawed libertarian thinking is opposition to any effort — such as requiring insurance — to handle the Emergency Room free-rider problem. Libertarians typically say that we should let sick or injured people die in the streets if they have not made provisions for their care. I am not entirely hostile to this libertarian idea EXCEPT for one thing: We are not going to let people die in the streets in this country. Libertarians typically get hostile at this point and angrily insist that they ~should~ be allowed to die…it was their choice. Cont… But harsh, brittle, strident beliefs of libertarians in such a matter are just not persuasive to anything like a majority of their fellow citizens. So if libertarian zeal does knock down the new insurance requirement — and it might — we will just continue with the unlibertarian practice of making everyone else pay for the free riders. But fervent libertarians are shrill, and they just refuse to get down to the nuts and bolts of reality. They are just full of “shoulds”…how things ~should~ be. The libertarian strawman in full swing. A great example of flawed libertarian thinking is opposition to any effort — such as requiring insurance — to handle the Emergency Room free-rider problem. Libertarians typically say that we should let sick or injured people die in the streets if they have not made provisions for their care. When has anyone said this? When has anyone said this? I’m sure more than a few of us have said it sarcastically and fuckwits like the guy you quoted were mendacious or stupid enough to then portray it as an actual libertarian view. These “waves of the future” were simply gussied-up tribalisms, anachronisms made gaudy with the trappings of modernity, like a gibbon in a spacesuit. That’s the Simile Of The Month right there. I like this line too In the old Soviet Union, Mao’s China, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, and today’s North Korea, they tried to move toward the ideal Communist system. Combined, they killed about 100 million of their own people. That’s a hefty moral distinction right there: When freedom-lovers move society toward their ideal, mistakes may be made, but people tend to flourish. When the hard Left is given free rein, millions are murdered and enslaved. Which ideal would you like to move toward? Which ideal would you like to move toward? Why, the ones with the best intentions of course, that’s all that matters. Rand Paul tells Evangelicals: “there is a War on Christianity” http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyf…..ar-on.aspx Ralph Nader asks the important questions: “Has There Been a Bigger Con Man in the White House Than Barack Obama?’ http://newsbusters.org/blogs/n…..rack-obama Maybe Sen. Paul thinks that’s what he has to do to get evangelicals to listen, but I wish he’d decide what he really believes and try to appear consistent about it. He will wind up sounding like Santorum by the first primary debate. CHRISTFAGS!!11!!!! You will wind up smelling like santorum by the first primary debate. You will wind up smelling like santorum by the first primary debate. ::spit take:: That speech is brilliant if you actually read it. And you guys know how I feel about Christianity. Basically the entire speech is anti foreign aid. It’s also anti war on terror. But the mechanism Rand has chosen to use to argue against it is “our allies in the war on terror kill people for being Christian”. He knows that on the GOP side the war on terror relies on an alliance between national security conservatives and the religious right. The weak point in that alliance is the pretty simple, obvious, an unrebuttable fact that the national security conservatives are bankrolling people who kill you for being a Christian, if you do it at the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong way. unrebuttable fact that the national security conservatives are bankrolling people who kill you for being a Christian, if you do it at the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong way. That is true. But it is not just conservatives who do this. Obama and the Democrats love giving money to those very same people. They are all basically Godless fucks who view the wiping out of Christians in the middle east as either a mildly regrettable consequence of necessary action or actively view it as a good thing. I very much doubt any of them actively support it. Most democrats are Christians too. But they certainly don’t seem to take it into account when deciding who to support. Is there any reason to suppose Rand Paul is being insincere about his Christian views, simply because his application of Christianity is different from that of some statist knob-gobbler? No, I think he’s probably fairly sincere. I just find it amusing that when he decides to wave a Bible in the air, he finds a way to do it that’s secretly an anti foreign aid argument. In much the same way that his dad used to disguise federalism arguments as his obligatory Bible hand-wave to the socons. It is true that the net result of all our foreign adventurism in the last 20 years has been the installation of new Islamic republics, regardless of administration. Commander of SS-led unit living in US http://apnews.myway.com/articl…..ETCO2.html Michael Karkoc, 94, told American authorities in 1949 that he had performed no military service during World War II, concealing his work as an officer and founding member of the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion and later as an officer in the SS Galician Division, according to records obtained by the AP through a Freedom of Information Act request. The Galician Division and a Ukrainian nationalist organization he served in were both on a secret American government blacklist of organizations whose members were forbidden from entering the United States at the time. Though records do not show that Karkoc had a direct hand in war crimes, statements from men in his unit and other documentation confirm the Ukrainian company he commanded massacred civilians, and suggest that Karkoc was at the scene of these atrocities as the company leader. Nazi SS files say he and his unit were also involved in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, in which the Nazis brutally suppressed a Polish rebellion against German occupation. I hate Minnesota Nazis. Better hurry up and arrest the remaining Nazis, or God will get to them before we do. Great idea! I like the quotes from the parents that are against it. Way to go, you just proved it works. If I still lived in the area, I’d go there all the time. I’m a big supporter of child free zones. My wife and I made the decision to not have children because we don’t like them. It would be nice to be able to go to a restaurant where we know we won’t be annoyed by unruly children. Not only does it keep out children but it keeps out the adults that think it’s ok to take their small children wherever they want. I have a one year old son, I think he very well behaved and does well when we take him out with us. That being said, as a parent you have to know that some places it’s not ok to take your kids. Going out for wings-great. Going out to an intimate sushi bar-not so much. I don’t mind having kids around while I eat. As long as they behave properly in public. I understand kids have to eat and parents don’t always want to cook, but is it too much to ask that they keep them from being obnoxious? I can’t count the number of times I’ve had kids run past me or just walk up to my table because they were bored or weren’t getting enough attention. I’m surprised more restaurants don’t try this. Nothing spoils a nice relaxed dinner more than out of control kids and crying babies. Too many parents they are afraid to piss off. Holy shit, babies cry? Who could have expected such a thing? The restaurant in the article bans kids under 18. I know that children don’t mature as quickly as they used to, but still, the avg. 16 yo isn’t going to be crying and soiling diapers – not in a restaurant anyway. SLD, etc. For an intimate sushi bar like that it makes more sense. The average 16 year old isn’t going to be crying and soiling diapers, but they still have very little impulse control and tend to be egocentric. A raucous group of teenagers isn’t a big deal in a noisy, busy restaurant like Denny’s. However, it is annoying when you go to a more upscale place and there is a group of teenagers acting like, well, teenagers. I think a good mix for upscale places could be to ban small children and have a strict policy of kicking out anyone who doesn’t understand the concept of “indoor voice”. At least that’s how I’d do it. We have a pair of Chinese restaurants owned by the same group. One is between the U and the hospital and fills up with sorostitutes and their 20 something ilk. The other is out east but in town and fills up with families. Guess which one is easier to have a quiet dinner in. Ooh. I’m taking the gf there tonight. Its mandatory date night. Oh I bet it’s the one with the families. Attention whores like to draw attention to themselves, usually loudly. If you want to be a WOO girl, go to a bar. That’s why I wish there were places that kicked out obnoxious people. I expect crowds, loud people, children, etc at most places, but when I want to have a quiet dinner with my wife it would be really nice to have a few choices where I’m guaranteed that there will be no obnoxious teenagers or random screeching children. U.S. Agencies Said to Swap Data With Thousands of Firms  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/…..firms.html Many of these same Internet and telecommunications companies voluntarily provide U.S. intelligence organizations with additional data, such as equipment specifications, that don’t involve private communications of their customers, the four people said. Makers of hardware and software, banks, Internet security providers, satellite telecommunications companies and many other companies also participate in the government programs. In some cases, the information gathered may be used not just to defend the nation but to help infiltrate computers of its adversaries. it’s hacking all the way down. You’re missing the point, we need net neutrality to solve these problems. NSA revelations, modified wheat cast a pall on U.S. trade talks with Europe  http://www.washingtonpost.com/…..story.html Chances for a broad trade deal between the United States and the European Union are fading following recent revelations about U.S. electronic surveillance programs, oversight of genetically modified food and other issues, according to officials and analysts in the United States and Europe who are following the discussions. European officials are set to meet in Brussels on Friday to debate a formal mandate for their negotiating team, and analysts who have reviewed the draft text say it points toward a more limited agreement rather than the expansive economic opening that officials said could unleash tens of billions of dollars in additional trade. The two [regulatory requirements] directly at issue here compel the company to (1) affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting environmental or safety concerns (You’ve seen the type: “How am I driving? 213-867-5309”) and (2) submit a plan listing off-street parking locations for each truck when not in service. From Elana Kegan’s unanimous opinion in a fairly innocuous trucking case the Court released yesterday. Was it her clerk who did that and Kegan didn’t notice or does Kegan have human like qualities? Clerk. For something like that, SCOTUS justices cannot be bothered. It tickles me that my post-First Year law school son is writing opinions for the Common Pleas Court where he’s interning. I know the stuff is well-vetted, and I’d certainly trust my son more than the judge he’s working for, but, still, it amuses me. I’m willing to bet your son pays more attention to whats going on in the court room than the judge. THIS! I’m thinking of changing my name to Per Curiam so when I write opinions . . . “(You’ve seen the type: “How am I driving? 213-867-5309″)” I seen your number on your U-Haul To complain, about my driving call 867-5309 (repeat) Baby, I got your number You’ll wish you’d never cut me off I’ll call your supervisor I’ve just about had enough (CHORUS) Mali manual suggests al-Qaida has feared weapon  http://news.yahoo.com/mali-man…..58976.html The photocopies of the manual lay in heaps on the floor, in stacks that scaled one wall, like Xeroxed, stapled handouts for a class. Except that the students in this case were al-Qaida fighters in Mali. And the manual was a detailed guide, with diagrams and photographs, on how to use a weapon that particularly concerns the United States: A surface-to-air missile capable of taking down a commercial airplane. There are so many shoulder fired missiles left over from the cold war. There were thousands of them laying around Iraq. It took months to collect all of them. Saddam had ammunition dumps like you wouldn’t believe. I find it hard to believe that at least some of them didn’t end up in the wrong hands. Yes, but how reliable are they? I think IR seekers need to be stored in a temperature controlled environment or they stop working. I don’t know. That is a good point. Sure, but they really only need one to work. Yeah they’re not exactly an AK. Pretty sure most, if not all, will be useless. Like all the fretting about the possibility of 80s era Stingers being used against US troops in Afghanistan. No way they lasted that long in usable condition. Batteries die, the seekers get messed up, the propellant degrades. To my knowledge there has never been a case of a shoulder fired missile taking down a US aircraft in Afghanistan or Iraq. RPGs have taken down a lot of helicopters. But I don’t think there have been any shoulder fired missiles. You would think if the things worked, they would have used a few in Afghanistan or Iraq first. And even if one were in perfect working condition, the user would have to know to arm the warhead separately from the rocket. I don’t know either. I think the modern ones can be stored in more extreme environments, but the seeker has to be cooled prior to firing, and you need weird chemicals to use as the refrigerant. Yeah, somehow I suspect some AQ missileer won’t be “hearing the tone” any time soon. And even given all that, suppose they do take down one airliner. Meh. (And I say that as someone who flies all the time.) Why would they need missiles anyway? AR-15s are powerful enough to shoot down airplanes and blow up trains. Given that airliners do not carry countermeasures or engage in evasive maneuvers or fly particularly fast on takeoff/landing it probably wouldn’t be that hard to hit one with a unguided rocket Hit a moving target going 200 mph from anywhere from a thousand feet to a mile? I think it would be harder than you think. I see Halbech’s hand in all this. Yay, Florida! Git outta my way, Old Farts! http://articles.orlandosentine…..uction-act Suck it, you other 56 States! Of course, Florida already had a couple of laws on the books to force slowpokes out of the fast lane, including a fine of $60 for offenders. Fucking enforce the laws already on the books instead of adding to the regulatory and bureaucratic scheme, jeez! While I’m happy to see that slow drivers will be punished (vindication!), this is a retarded law and even more retarded story because it has always been “against the law” to be driving in the passing lane when not passing anyone. When cops and bureaucrats have a way to actually make traffic flow better and safer, they do nothing. When something they want to do is proven not to work (ticket speeders), they do it to the max. Ticketing speeders works just fine. It brings lots of revenue into the treasury every year. Having driven in 47 of our great 56, I’d maintain that driving in Florida is the worst. Everyone is driving either 20 mph over the limit or 20 mph under, and all doing it on the same highway. As a native Floridian, I’d have to disagree. Indiana is the worst. If someone is going exactly the wrong speed in FL, chances are they have GA plates. Reminds me of the old Houston joke: Guy is doing 80 in the left lane, gets pulled over by a cop. Cop approaches his window and says, “Sir, I’m going to have to ticket you for impeding the flow of traffic.” Guy says, “But officer, I was doing 80!” Cop says, “Have it your way, I’ll write you a ticket for speeding, too.” Czech police from the organized crime unit raided the offices of a close aide to the prime minister and seized documents, sparking calls for the PM to resign. Hey, how come they can do that and we can’t? Corruption in the Czech republic? This is my shocked face. Leaving aside the mechanics of the data gathering, the most offensive part our new “all surveillance, all the time” program to me is the fucking gag orders which accompany the “warrants”. “Investigations” completely shielded from disclosure and review are not due process. Our rush toward banana republic autocracy continues. http://dailycaller.com/2013/06…..ui-factor/ Apparently one of the big hold ups on the immigration bill is that its supporters privately are insisting that amnesty be granted to people with DUI convictions. Now, that in itself doesn’t bother me. I think DUI is way over enforced in this country. Except, I can’t think of a single other instance where politicians will so much as lift a finger for anyone ever convicted for a DUI. Yet, somehow if it involves illegal aliens DUIs are just no big deal. The rest of us can go get fucked if we happen to get caught in a road block and blow a .09. But illegal aliens, they are just fine. This more than anything is why the open borders crowd piss me off so much. For most of them, this has nothing to do with freedom or anything except tribal politics and getting their tribe special treatment. My problem is that they’ve proposed absolutely nothing to make it easier for an unmarried eastern European girl to come visit without going through the farce of the “fiance visa.” We should apply Brazil’s policy of strict reciprocity. That is because it is all about giving special status to Mexicans and Irish. It is total tribal politics and nothing else. What about Bernardo O’Higgins? Too South American. I support open borders but oppose amnesty. Go home and then reenter correctly. Exactly – we need more Ellis Island style entries. Shots, health screen, check for warrants… here is your paper/card/whatever…NEXT IN LINE, PLEASE. Maybe France will give us two more statues, one for San Diego and one for McAllen. check for warrants If you’ve got one in the home country, please step over to the refugee line to plead your case. Ah, yes, correction accepted. good point. So with the Myriad Genetics case, Myriad can still patent its own tests, right, just not the human genes involved? That seems reasonable, as I’d expect a unanimous opinion written by Justice Thomas to be. If only my law school exams had been  like this: The question posits a familiar student scenario in which a female student tricks one man into getting gobbled by another man, bums a second man with a bottle and rips off a third’s pubic hair, resulting in an infection and untimely death. “Familiar”? You know how those schools in Oz are… What, that’s never happened to you? That’s a typical Saturday night for some people around here: The question posits a familiar student H&R commentariat scenario in which a female student Warty tricks one man SugarFree into getting gobbled by another man Epi, bums a second man FoE with a bottle and rips off a third’s Pro L’s pubic hair, resulting in an infection and untimely death. just another day at H&R It ain’t gay if you’re not catching. Pro Lib is too old for death to be “untimely”, unless by “untimely” you mean “millennia overdue”. Also, I thought Warty’s MO was brute force, not trickery. Usually, but he likes to change it up every once in a while to keep his victims “comcubines” guessing. *”concubines”* Shit, talk about your all time freudian slips. It wouldn’t slip if you had EDIT BUTTON. +1 monocle! The FBI is officially digging into the surveillance problem ? that is, what to do about Edward Snowden letting everybody know we’re being spied upon by Big Brother. “The problem is not what we’re doing. The problem is that somebody tipped off the peasants.” Look, now we (Congress and the administration) are at greater risk from the enemy (the American public), who we have already seen changing tactcs in response to this leak (posting less useful evidence for the IRS on Facebook, encrpyting emails, etc.) Black family progress has stalled since controversial 1965 study, report says  http://www.mcclatchydc.com/201…..alled.html Many of the same social problems highlighted in a landmark 1965 study on black family structure have only worsened over the last 48 years and are now causing similar hardship for white and Hispanic families. That’s a major finding of a new report by the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank, which re-examines the circumstances of black families nearly five decades after former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan authored the controversial report, “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action.” need MORE WELFARE STATE! It was just bad luck. Welfare, unions destroying the schools, the drug war sending millions of men to prison and paying young women to have children out of wedlock had nothing to do with this. It is really sad. The government really is out to get black people. Just not in the way most black people think they are. I just wonder if the consequences of these policies are unintended or totally planned. Given LBJ’s comment about having them vote democrat for next 200 years, I’m leaning toward planned. How dare you suggest that TEAM Blue had anything but the best of intentions towards black people! Sure they corraled black people into these pigeon coops called federal housing projects, made welfare easy to get into but hard to get out of, forced black people out of their traditional neighborhoods in the name of urban renewal, created an entire generation of unemployable black men via the drug war and the credentialist, human resources system of employment we have to today, but don’t you dare suggest that TEAM Blue doesn’t love the black man. And all this after being the party of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation….. Many of the same social problems highlighted in a landmark 1965 study on black family structure have only worsened over the last 48 years and are now causing similar hardship for white and Hispanic families. Leftists spend 50 years criticizing and undermining the cultural structures that kept even poor black families relatively stable, then act shocked that the dysfunctions they enabled has subsequently made things harder for all races in the US. http://online.wsj.com/article/…..TopOpinion Best of the Web yesterday on the organization in California, formed by a corporation to promote Obamacare. Amazingly, its tax exempt status went right through. Taranto called it – they’re rich enough to know the rules of nonprofit advocacy, so they get to cock-tease all the way over to the line of partisanship without crossing that line. Evolutionary socio-biology is garbage science! Unless it finds something else that feminists can blame on men. So who is claiming evolutionary socio-biology is garbage science? SugarFree, or the author of the article? Feminists deride evo-psych and evo-socio on a regular basis. I am therefore claiming it sarcastically. Evo psych is such mushy crap, I am really surprised feminists haven’t embraced it. It would be so easy to make up a narrative using evolution to blame all of the world’s ills on men. They are missing an opportunity. Uh I thought menopause happened because women have a finite number of eggs. a group of Canadian researchers used computer models to show that menopause is an unintended outcome of natural selection Computer models? Well then, TEH SCIENCE IZ SETTLED!!!11!!!!111!! How about, “all outcomes of natural selection are unintended.” The House voted to restrict (but not eliminate) the president’s power to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens. In other words, they voted to allow the President to subject U.S. citizens to legal proceedings that are neither speedy nor public. INFINITY BARF! Now You Will Be Able to Smell ‘Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’ “You’ve seen them. You’ve heard them. Now you will smell them,” promises a TLC press release for the upcoming second season of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. The network will be hosting a “Watch ‘n Sniff” event for the season premiere on July 17 by distributing scent cards in issues of People, Us, through Time Warner Cable, and handed out personally by street teams (those poor interns) in major markets. The cards will have six different scents that will correlate to the premiere episode so that “viewers will be able to watch the show, scratch their cards and redneckognize the aromas associated with the Boo Boo gang as they welcome the sights, sounds and smells of summer.” As a reminder (in case you might have somehow forgotten) farts are featured heavily in every episode. What are the six smells? Obviously “fart” is one. Stale tobacco? Southern summer crotch sweat? Cheese breath? Yeast infection? Hot dog chili? Who the fuck would want to participate in this? low information voters? masochists? Canada as a whole Wait a minute, are you godwinning the thread? The cards will have six different scents that will correlate to the premiere episode so that “viewers will be able to watch the show, scratch their cards and redneckognize the aromas associated with the Boo Boo gang as they welcome the sights, sounds and smells of summer.” 1) Fart 2) Fromunda cheese 3) Budweiser 4) Tobacco spit 5) Stale crotch sweat 6) Road kill possum decaying in the hot sun redneckognize Nice. Even calling them “rednecks” is flattering them–they’re really just white trash. A redneck is someone that actually works hard in the sun all day. These blobs do nothing but sit around all day and collect welfare and child support checks. Yes, it’s kind of a scandal that people should be mocked for something associated with hard work. It’s job-based snobbery, implying that these folks are dumb because they don’t work in an office drawing up org charts and filling out TPS reports all day. Actually, that’s a false association. Rednecks were originally named for WV cola miners to be able to distinguish themselves from the military men sent to kill them for uprising against coal companies. They wore red bandanas around their necks, and were called rednecks. I thought it come from the Afrikaans word rooinek, a Boer insult upon the pasty-skinned English who were flooding into the veldt in the early 19th century. Pair of Boston parking spaces fetch $560,000 at IRS auction. Does anyone want to get together to build an exclusive parking garage and auction off the spots? I have always believed that the best investment in Boston is parking. This seriously sounds like it could be a very good investment, if you could find some cheaper buildings to buy and tear down. Because it’s illegal to create any new spaces. If you build new housing, it’s actually required that you have some minimum portion of the space dedicated to parking. Right, but you can’t build parking LOTS. Since any spaces constructed in conjunction with new housing are offset by the new housing, that means that the net amount of available parking in Boston can only ever ratchet one way. Really? So the (admittedly few) parking garages around just predate the law? Yes. The EPA made Boston enter in a consent agreement to enforce the Clean Air Act that prohibits the construction of new parking garages. It’s supposed to encourage people to use mass transit. It’s a free country! Maybe having mass transit go further outside the city and run later than 12:30 AM would encourage people to use it more. To learn how to do it to journalists, presumably. I LOL’d. That’s some classic Tuccille. Holy shit, only 3 Democrats voted to restrict the President’s power to indefinitely detain Americans. Duh, the President is a Democrat. Why would we restrict a Democrat? Do you hate women, you monster? Quote of the morning One former Republican Justice Department political appointee tells PJ Media, “These quotes show America what anyone who ever worked with Gonzales has known for years: he is a moron.” http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2013…..ds-holder/ Another interesting tidbit from that One former Hill staffer reported to Tatler that: John Ashcroft had essentially been cut out of the loop and Gonzales’ White House Counsel folks were actually in charge of writing and negotiating the Patriot Act. But then it turned out Ashcroft himself evidently did not support much of the Patriot Act ? and for sure not Gonzales’ interpretation of it, at least not at Ashcroft’s hospital bed side. Once Gonzales became AG when the Patriot Act was reauthorized, Gonzales ran the reauthorization from Justice and made the law worse. I do know this for a fact, it was OLC who completely fucked up the interpretation of the GCs in 2001 and gave us GUITMO. They were the ones who said that we couldn’t run Article 5 tribunals and that subjecting terrorists to them was somehow granting them GC rights. http://www.guardian.co.uk/worl…..ni=Network front:network-front aux-1 top-stories-1:Bento box 8 col:Position1 “He described how Khalid al-Midhar, one of the 9-11 hijackers, had called a Yemeni safe house from a phone in San Diego shortly before the attack ? a phone call that would have been intercepted and acted upon, claimed Mueller, had today’s surveillance system been in place.” You know what else would have stopped 9/11? Bulletproof cockpit doors on all commercial airliners with reinforced locks. Good thing we have those, now this asshole doesn’t have to worry about stopping “the next 9/11.” phone call that would have been intercepted and acted upon, Just like that tip from the Russians that the two guys in Boston were dangerous was acted upon. Politicians and bureaucrats – masters of the hypothetical What a bunch of BS. If they knew the phone number of the Yemeni safe house, they could have easily had legal authorization and the existing technology to intercept the call. If they didn’t know the safe house number, but were instead collecting and analyzing 1000’s of calls per hour, there is no way they would have been able to act on any of the information that they collected in the short time between the call and the attach. It would be the proverbial ‘needle in the haystack’. Muller just pointed out another way that they dropped the ball. You know what else would have stopped 9/11? “Lets Roll” posters in every airport. Admittedly, thats a bit unfair. But that is the entirety of the security measures needed after 9/11. You know what else would have stopped 9/11? A crystal ball? Seriously, I don’t know and don’t really care what would have stopped it. Our security system failed. Out intel networks failed. Our immigration policy failed. But our government’s solution for 12+ years has been to give the assholes who failed even more control over us. Fuck that idiotic shit. You hear that, NSA? FUCK THAT SHIT! AND FUCK YOU FOR READING THIS!!!!! Yes, let’s reward national security agencies for messing up by giving them more money and power – no way that could lead to perverse incentives or anything! a phone call that would have been intercepted and acted upon, claimed Mueller, had today’s surveillance system been in place.” I highly doubt it. Unless they’re lieing through their teeth about only collecting metadata. All the metadata would have told them was that al_midhar had called someone in Yemen from San Diego. And that’s all. They wouldn’t have had the contents of the call since they’re not actually listening to our phone conversations. Right? RIGHT? You know what else could have prevented 9/11? If someone had alerted the FBI that a bunch of weird Middle Eastern guys were very interested in learning how to fly planes, but not so much how to land them. So you were involved in a car chase involving dozens of cruisers, then 137 rounds were unloaded into an empty car and you helped kill two unarmed people? I guess we’re gonna have to go ahead and fire one of you and then give some of the others a short vacation. That ought to placate the savages, right boys? Cleveland police fired a sergeant and meted out demotions and suspensions Tuesday for a car chase last year that involved five dozen cruisers, 137 rounds of ammunition fired by 13 officers, and the death of two people who, it turned out, were probably unarmed. Probably unarmed? What, do they think it’s possible that one of the people they shot managed to throw an invisibility spell over a weapon? If you didn’t find a weapon, then there wasn’t one there. No, we’re talking Cleveland PD here. It’s quite possible that they were so inattentive that they all missed a gun being chucked out a window during the car chase. In the defense of the cops, it is really hard to watch what’s going on as you’re stroking your gun in anticipation of your first next chance to use it on a civilian and stroking your huge rageboner at the same time…all while driving at 120 mph. It’s east Cleveland! The potholes are so bad, the cops were probably bouncing around inside their vehicles. Try maintaining a clear sight picture in that environment. Surely you know there’s no double standard for the pigs! Czech police from the organized crime unit raided the offices of a close aide to the prime minister and seized documents, sparking calls for the PM to resign. Hey, how come they can do that and we can’t? I think we all know the answer to that question. Because fuck you, that’s why. Thank God for New York. Only their strict gun control laws, which put arms almost exclusively in the possession of police officers, keep their citizens safe. Unless, of course, you’re the wife of a deranged police officer that gets gunned down because your right to self-defense has been taken away. But their system works. The cop had his service weapon taken away last month…because he beat his wife up. Instead of a protective order and lengthy suspension/termination, he was transferred to a job that didn’t require him to carry a gun. FTA: Smikle flew off the handle when his wife came home late from work and didn’t cook dinner, a source said. Classy guy. I hope the bagpipers miss a not or two at his parade. Smikle flew off the handle when his wife came home late from work and didn’t cook dinner In that case it was totally justified. Starvation is a horrible way to die. Seeing as officer safety is the most important thing, and cops are cowards, he was right to act on his fear of a potentially deadly situation. He’s got a wife and 8 year old to get home to. He’s got a wife and 8 year old to get home to. Well, not anymore. A “civilian” gets caught with a stash of pills that aren’t his and he gets tossed in the slammer. Months later, it turns out that the brave first-responder, hero of the Republic and defender of children from drugs wasn’t exactly truthful and intentionally mishandled evidence. Will he face charges? Was he immediately arrested and charged with evidence tampering, perjury, gross misconduct or even a seat-belt infraction?  Of course not. But at least the “hero” got fired. The people he helped put away are still locked up, by the way. But the DA is going to “look into it”. By the way, the penalty for sending an e-mail to the state bureau of investigations merely accusing a cop of murder will get you  charged with a series of felonies. But there’s no double-standard, is there? Crazy guy with a grudge accuses cop of crime but cop is never charged…felony charges. Cop lies and manufactures/mishandles evidence and people are convicted based on that…termination but no charges. Yeah, I’m gonna have to say that’s totally fucked. No. Double. Standard. Dunphy told me so. Was he gone while I’ve been away? I hate to think he was on here spewing his absurdities while I was working my ass off in my new job. Not gone, but much less frequent. Conspiracy theory – Dunphy is Sloopy’s sock. Everybody is a sockpuppet here. Lt. Joey LeBlanc has the eyes of a sociopath. Held to a higher standard! State trooper accused of drunken driving pleads guilty to careless driving, DWI dismissed DULUTH, Minn. ? A Minnesota State Patrol trooper accused of driving drunk on his way to a training session in Duluth has pleaded guilty to careless driving. The drunken driving charge has been dismissed by the city attorney. St. Louis County Judge Richard Jessen stayed a 90-day jail term for Nick Morse and placed him on 14 months of probation. Defense attorney Frederic Bruno says the plea agreement was a reasonable compromise. Bruno says it’s likely Morse will return to law enforcement. City Attorney Gunnar Johnson says the 30-year-old Two Harbors man had no prior history and a low test level for drunken driving. The Duluth News Tribune (http://bit.ly/11ArZDM ) says Morse must undergo a chemical dependency evaluation Somebody has to win the “Officer Of The Day” award for bravery, perseverance and doing the right thing in the face of extreme adversity. I think picking today’s winner is easy. I don’t even know where to begin with the stupidity in this case. … … still at a loss. If only he had raped some women or beat the shit our of some homeless man, he would still have a job. I suspect this guy might be an honest cop and that is why they started looking into his Army records. an honest cop Finally. A real Friday Funnies we can chuckle at. There had to be some reason they looked in his Army records. That he knew something and was likely to talk or actually started acting like cops ought to be subject to rules seems like the most likely explanation. There is nothing more serious than getting free license plates for 4 years. Nothing. If you’re a Democrat politician in SoCal and you completely fabricate a war record, including a series of decorations you’ve won, all for political gain, you’re covered under the First Amendment (and should be, IMO). But if you’re a cop whose wife gets her leg tore off by a train in a parade, possibly making up whether or not you got one single award will result in your excommunication and destroying of your character all to lower the settlement amount in a civil case. He really should have claimed a head injury made him forget exactly where he received his Purple Heart. Notice the army doesn’t actually say he never won the Purple Heart, just that they have no record of it? How much you want to bet the issue is more the army’s record keeping than Ladner’s honesty? Italian alternative progressive metal! Featuring Marco Minnemann on drums (super whoopass drummer for those not in the know). The life of a stay-at-home dad who is also a metalhead. \m/ Who can’t post links correctly. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydHMU05BknE Is barking covered by the First Amendment? Apparently not in Frederick, Maryland where  a man was arrested for barking at a police dog. FTA: When officers tried to get Disney out of the car, he braced himself against the interior and resisted until another officer arrived and told him he would be tasered. Disney was taken to the Frederick County Adult Detention Center, where he was released after posting $4,500 bail. He is charged with harassing a police canine and resisting arrest. Nothing like enhancers when you’re arresting a “civilian”. It ensures that plea bargain and a sweet conviction rate for the DA. Some people are terrified of large dogs. I bet this guy is that and also maybe a bit slow and thus did what he did. But it is double bonus points for cops to arrest and harass disabled people. That’s protected speech, I don’t care what the pigs in Maryland say. He didn’t do anything to intentionally incite a riot. In fact, he didn’t even address a person. I’d like to see a good civil rights attorney take this on pro bono and get this law stricken from the books. Because if a cop can walk through a gate without a warrant and shoot a dog because the dog reacted to him being there and physically/verbally inciting him, all without charge or punishment, the “civilian” in this case should be able to do the same thing without penalty. Also, I’d be willing to bet the traffic stop wasn’t even legal. As a rule, the compliant news agencies will give the reason for the stop if there’s a legitimate one, even if it’s determined after the fact, to give the resulting police action some credence. That’s missing in this story. Of course it is. And the cops don’t give a fuck. They made their point. What is going to happen? The city pay some fees? LOLOLOL This. He imitated (barked like) a dog? I’m surprised the cops didn’t shoot him. More reason for me to dislike our Lord and Master Dear Leader: I have to work all weekend because his minions did not like anything about the web site we produced, EVEN THOUGH THEY SIGNED OFF ON THE DESIGN! I told my boss that I recognize that “I don’t like this” is political code for “I changed my mind”. If they don’t spend all of their budget this year they can’t get it back next year. They’re just taking advantage of their ability to stimulize your business to puff up next year’s allocation. Somehow I think the Prez gets however much money he wants regardless of last year’s budget. Just a funny feeling I have. And believe me, the program behind this web site is a doozy. It’s meant to be Obummer’s “legacy” when he leaves office. Once it goes public, I’ll share. It really is the pinnacle of liberal elitism disguised as do-gooderism. Just wink if you’ve built it to sabotage itself — although I don’t know how you could do a better job than following the client’s orders to the letter. How do you look at yourself in the mirror every morning knowing that you turned down a good private sector job to keep working for the evil empire that is our federal government? The same goes for John and any others out there that are hiding the fact that you work for those fucks. I didn’t turn down a good private sector job. I thought you got offered that job in New Hampshire or Vermont or somewhere where maple syrup is being stolen and taken into Canada. My bad. Either way, you should GTFO so you can feel better every day. Also, when are you and the squeeze heading out on your motorcycle tour? I thought you were gonna come out west and visit. I had an interview in VT and they thought my $70k salary requirement was too high. $70k. Too high. I think the motorcycle tour will be fall of ’14 (some goddamn Brits will be joining us). We’ll certainly get together with the sloopy clan! OK, but don’t bring the Limeys to my house. Unless they’re fully prepared to mock the royal family and their entire system of government. Does Britain still have Cromwell supporters? One of them is a semi-libertarian Mainah (she would be more libertarian if she had stayed in Maine and hadn’t exposed herself to the evils of the United Kingdom for the last 15 years). The other one is fixin to retire form a career in the Royal Army. What kind of libertarian are you, quartering British troops? The one interview I had in Vermont for an engineering position turned out to be offering $40k. That’s fucked up, AD. I did my research on average salary differences between DC and Burlington, and calculated that asking for $70k would be giving myself a tiny raise (about 5%), just enough so I could afford moving expenses and nice double wide on some acreage. Yeah, needless to say I immediately lost interest, and the interview was over like 15 minutes later. I like the area, and it is cheaper to live… But not nearly enough to justify that much of a salary difference. A $5k drop, sure. Even $10k, maybe. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new…..water.html Jeff Flake is moving up the rankings for Senatorial awesomeness. http://www.reuters.com/article…..0320130612 Sailor survives for days in small air bubble. My favorite bit was when he realized that there was a diver in the compartment, swam down and touched the diver on the shoulder to get his attention.

Thank God his balls didn’t have to breathe the same air, they’d have suffocated him.

6.16.2013 1:00 PM The killings of 20 first-grade students and six adult staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012, obviously constitutes a terrible, newsworthy event. But the news coverage did more than report the details of what happened at Newtown. It also sought to classify this incident as an instance of a larger problem. The initial news reports described what had happened as ""the second deadliest school shooting,"" ""another mass shooting,"" and a ""mass killing"" (all in stories in the next day's New York Times) and as ""the second deadliest shooting event in U.S. history"" (The Washington Post). The Post's website ranked the 12 ""Deadliest U.S. shootings"" (the earliest case on their list occurred in 1949), while the Mother Jones website added Newtown to its page ""A Guide to Mass Shootings in America"" (which included only cases from 1982 to 2012). It may seem self-evident that the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary ought to be classified as a shooting event, or as a school shooting or a mass shooting. Of course we classify events into categories that make sense to us, and it is easy to take familiar categories for granted. We learn of terrible crimes and we are accustomed to commentators talking about incidents as instances. But the ways we make sense of the world—the terms we use to describe that world—are created by people, and they are continually evolving, so that specific categories come into and fall out of favor. In fact, in recent decades, Americans have understood events like the Newtown killings in a variety of ways. In 1966, Charles Whitman killed 14 people and wounded 32 others by shooting from a 28th floor observation deck on the University of Texas campus in Austin. (In addition, before coming to the campus, he killed his wife and mother.) Whitman had been an Eagle Scout and a Marine; commentators at the time puzzled that an apparently respectable young man had committed such a terrible crime. The Whitman shootings occurred less than three weeks after Richard Speck had murdered eight student nurses by stabbing or strangling them. Reporters linked the two cases, and also mentioned other killers, such as Charles Starkweather and the ""Son of Sam,"" in articles about mass slayings, mass killings, or multiple killings. In the 1960s and 1970s, then, it was understood that the key feature of these cases was a high body count. These early discussions of mass murder lumped together cases that varied along what would come to be seen as important dimensions: Time: Did the killings occur more or less simultaneously, or did they extend over several days, months, or years? Place: Did the killings occur in a single location, or in a variety of places? Method: How were the victims killed? By the early 1980s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation promoted the distinction between mass murder and serial murder. The Bureau had a new databank—the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, or VICAP—that could help law enforcement identify similar crimes that had occurred in other jurisdictions. But in the aftermath of revelations about the FBI's surveillance of the civil rights movement, an effort to expand the bureau's domestic data collection invited suspicion and resistance. The FBI used the serial murderer menace—and particularly the idea that serial killers might be nomadic, able to kill in different jurisdictions without the authorities ever recognizing that crimes in different places might be linked—to justify the VICAP program. That set the stage for Clarice Starling and all the other heroic FBI agents who began pitting their wits against serial murderers in crime fiction and movies. ""Son of Sam"" would no longer be classified with Charles Whitman. Charles Starkweather, who killed several people during a 1958 crime spree was also moved into a separate category. The bureau developed the concept of spree murders, a series of killings in different places over a period of time, often occurring as a fugitive tries to stay ahead of the law. Mass murder was now understood to involve, not just several victims, but killings that occurred in more or less the same place, at more or less the same time. But how many victims are needed to make a mass murder? Obviously, whatever line is drawn will be arbitrary. Some analysts have argued for including any incident with three or more homicides; most favor four or more as the standard. The lower the minimum number of victims, the more incidents will be counted as mass murders. Setting the bar at 33 would exclude all of the killings on The Washington Post's list of American incidents (which presents the 32 murders at Virginia Tech as the deadliest U.S. shooting), although other events, such as the 77 killings by Anders Breivik in Norway in 2011, would still count. Journalists notice patterns, so similarities between cases invite the creation of new categories. For example, in 1986, a postal worker killed 14 postal employees; then, in 1991, there were two more incidents involving former postal workers killing employees at post offices. This led to the expression going postal. Eventually, after further incidents in 1993, the Postal Service responded with a program to improve their workplace and prevent violence. Some criminologists began writing about workplace violence, although this category was defined as including any violence in a workplace, not just mass murders. Under that definition, a large share of workplace violence involved robberies. (According to one analysis, the three most common sites for workplace violence were taxicabs, liquor stores, and gas stations—all isolated settings likely to have cash on hand.) At the end of the 1990s, attention shifted to schools. During the 1997–98 academic year, there were heavily publicized incidents in West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Springfield, Oregon. The Jonesboro story made the cover of Time, which featured a photo of one of the shooters as a young child wearing camouflage and holding a rifle, with the caption ""Armed & Dangerous."" Thus, the expression school shooting was already familiar a year before the April 1999 killings at Columbine. Advocates and academics began compiling databases of school violence, although the results were surprising: The average number of deaths per year fell, from 48 during the period from the fall of 1992 through the spring of 1997, to 32 during the period spanning September 1997 through the end of the school year in 2001, even though Columbine and the other best-publicized cases occurred during the latter period. In spite of commentators declaring that the nation was experiencing a wave or epidemic of school shooting, the evidence suggested that violent deaths in schools were declining. It isn't entirely clear what counts as school violence. The Journal of School Violence began publication in 2002, but its pages tend to be filled with articles about bullying, sexual harassment, prevention and response programs, and other topics that define violence broadly. The killings at Virginia Tech (2007) and Northern Illinois University (2008) were referred to as school shootings, indicating that colleges could count as schools. Defining the problems in terms of its setting, such as workplace violence or school violence, suggests that steps need to be taken to protect people in those settings. Thus, the Postal Service devised a program to address workers' frustrations and to prevent violence, just as, post-Columbine, many schools sought to beef up security measures. The response of the National Rifle Association following the killings at Newtown—recommending that more schools be staffed with armed security personnel—implied that the problem was violence in schools. But the Newtown shootings followed a number of other high-profile shooting incidents outside of schools, including the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D–Ariz.) and some 2012 incidents at a movie theater near Denver, a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee, and a Minneapolis factory, settings with little in common. Gun control advocates, of course, had viewed school shootings as shootings, rather than tragedies in schools. They had been calling for a new federal ""assault weapons"" ban ever since the earlier ban expired in 2004, and the Colorado movie theater shootings had involved an assault weapon, so some of the commentary following that incident emphasized the nature of the gun. But the weapons used in other incidents, including the Giffords shooting, were pistols, leading most gun control advocates to emphasize that there had been a wave of mass shootings: that this was a gun problem that needed to be addressed. Many liberals had been critical of the Obama administration's reluctance to draw attention to gun control as an issue during the 2012 presidential campaign. But the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary occurred after the election, and pro–gun control advocates and commentators now became even more vocal in drawing attention to mass shootings. Since the Newtown killings also involved an assault rifle, some advocates called for limiting magazine capacities or otherwise restricting assault weapons. Yet there were competing interpretations. Coverage of several recent violent events—including the shootings at Virginia Tech, the Giffords rally, the Colorado movie theater, and Newtown—emphasized that the shooters had been treated for mental illness. Therefore, there were calls for more thorough background checks for gun purchases, checks that would make it harder for mentally disturbed individuals to gain access to firearms. In the aftermath of the Newtown killings, there were interesting parallels between the comments of those advocating on behalf of gun owners and those advocating on behalf of the mentally ill. Gun advocates argued that there are hundreds of millions of guns, but that very few of those guns (or gun owners) are involved in mass shootings. Similarly, mental health advocates pointed out that tens of millions of individuals have mental problems, but very few of them turn to violence, let alone mass murder. Both arguments are, of course, true, because mass shootings are rare. According to The New Republic, there were 70 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012, leaving 543 people dead. The magazine does not say whether this death toll includes the shooters, who often—but not always—also die. But let us assume that only the shooters' victims were counted. (Amy Sullivan, the New Republic article's author, says she believes that is the case.) That works out to about 2.3 incidents and 18 victims' deaths per year. Last year was an unusually bad year, with 68 people killed in seven mass shootings—a terrible toll, to be sure. But in the context of some 2.5 million deaths from all causes last year, mass shootings, while dramatic, are simply not a major cause of death. And because these events are quite rare, and their number fluctuates from year to year, it is difficult to determine a clear trend. The horrors of 2012 made it easy from some commentators to claim that mass shootings were on the rise, but should there be fewer cases in 2013, it is unlikely that people will note that the problem is growing smaller. My point is that it is possible to characterize Newtown as an instance of a lot of different social problems: as a mass shooting; as a school shooting; as mass murder; as workplace violence (remember the staff members who were killed were at work); as a crime involving an assault rifle; as a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence; and so on. We expect journalists to have a sort of sociological imagination, to help us understand incidents as instances. And we can understand why advocates for gun control, mental health, or other causes might favor particular labels, but we need to appreciate there is no One True Classification, that the categories we use are merely tools that may help us better understand what happening in our society.

Let’s not forget Nidal Hassan, everyone’s favorite case of “workplace violence”. What a useless article. No new information, shed no light on a new, creative way to view these situations. Nothing. A big, fat zero. Thanks for wasting my time, Reason! The guy is a professor of sociology. This is a very good point. My bad for missing such an obvious warning to avoid this article! Here’s a good sociological look at rampage killers. Interesting read. Article should be retitled: “How Should We Pick Fly Shit Out Of Pepper”. According to The New Republic, there were 70 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012, leaving 543 people dead. Using a gun for mass murder is rather inefficient. McVeigh’s handiwork claimed 168 lives. One guy with a truck, some diesel and some fertilizer. The Feds used fire to slaughter ~70 people in Waco and yet the agencies involved are still operating. 543 deaths over 30 years doesn’t seem like too big a deal. Each individual death is a tradgedy but I’m certainly not loosing any sleep even thinking about mass murder. Mass shootings are usually the result of some random nut job, and a free society can’t be free of risk. However, the deaths caused by government employees, local police or feds are genuine cause for concern. In fact, just in 2012, a single year, not three decades, 587 people died by being shot by the police. So the pigs beat the nut jobs handily. No doubt some, perhaps most, of those shootings were justified, but it seems that I’m more likli to be shot by a government employee than I am by a crazed, angry person with a gun. We need government control, not gun control. But then everybody here already knows that…. You SF’d the link. But THIS is a very good point. Reason, can you see fit to let crashland write an article about this subject? I bet he’s not a Sociology Professor (just a guess). Many of Reason’s commentators are brighter and more interesting than Reason’s writers. But do we want Warty to write articles about perverted sex? If there are to be articles about perverted sex, I would much prefer them to be written by SugarFree. Only 587 killings by police? Even if as many as half of them are unjustified that actually seems incredibly good if it’s nationwide. Does it seem strange to react that way? ” it seems that I’m more likli to be shot by a government employee than I am by a crazed, angry person with a gun.” A non-empty intersection to be sure. My point is that it is possible to characterize Newtown as an instance of a lot of different social problems: as a mass shooting; as a school shooting; as mass murder; as workplace violence (remember the staff members who were killed were at work); as a crime involving an assault rifle; as a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence; and so on. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Good intentions like thinking a sign that says “Gun Free Zone” will keep kids safe, when in fact it emboldens murderers since they can be confident that no one in the “Defenseless Victim Zone” can shoot back. I don’t think those are good intentions. That’s because you’re thinking. You’re supposed to emote. “Guns around children? What if someone gets into an argument? What if a child gets their hands on the gun? What if there’s a dispute over a parking space? SOMEONE WILL DIE!” Journalists notice patterns when they want to, or when it is ideologically convenient to do so. It’s a truism that any paper can create a “crime wave” by simply being diligent about reporting. The “epidemic” of mass shootings and “gun violence” is largely a media creation, as the statistics show. The media can also do the opposite, as they have with all the racial violence in recent years, in which mobs of black youths attack whites. There have been dozens or even scores of such attacks, but the only people who mention the racial component are some right-wing bloggers and the White Pride types. Journalists just describe it as “youths” attacking people, because it doesn’t fit the PC narrative to go too far into the details, though of course they would if the races were reversed. Heck, even bringing it up as an example risks someone calling me a “racist.” A friend who gets most of her news from the NY Times was astonished that she’d never read about these attacks. I wasn’t. Far from doing any “racial healing,” Obama’s election has made it harder to accurately perceive and talk about anything awkward regarding race. Yes. It has long since become a joke. If they don’t give the race of the mob that attacked someone, you know said mob was black or maybe Hispanic. The corollary is that in a case of political corruption, if the party affiliation of the corrupt pol is not mentioned (particularly in the first paragraph), 99% of the time they are a “D”. Yes. It has long since become a joke. If they don’t give the race of the mob that attacked someone, you know said mob was black or maybe Hispanic. Say it again! Say WHAT one more time! I dare you! I double-dare you, motherfucker! “any paper can create a “crime wave” by simply being diligent about reporting” I recall in the months leading up to the gun cobtrol votes during Clinton our local tv media spending half there news programs reporting every gun murder that happened aroubd the country. Had never done that before, and they stopped doing so immediately after it passed. Unfortunately the sheeple were suckered in by this and did not see through it for what it was. as a crime involving an assault rifle Unless I’m mistaken, it would be an “assault weapon”, not an “assault rifle”. An “assault rifle” refers to rifles with selective fire, while “assault weapon” refers to weapons (including but not limited to rifles) that have one or more (depending on the legislation) common features categorized by law. The rifle at Sandy Hook would did not have selective fire, and thus would not be an “assault rifle”. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle Exactly! Saw this on Instapundit. What happens when a little idiot liberal journalist chick buys a gun to make some stupid point about gun control?  Terror. Tony told me a Glock doesn’t have an external safety feature, so when I got home and opened the box and saw the magazine in the gun I freaked. I was too scared to try and eject it as thoughts flooded my mind of me accidentally shooting the gun and a bullet hitting my son in the house or rupturing the gas tank of my car, followed by an earth-shaking explosion. This was the first time my hands shook from the adrenaline surge and the first time I questioned the wisdom of this 30-day experiment. Contains comments, which contain projection. Bob Bates says: June 13, 2013 at 2:11 pm Heidi dramatically makes the point that our society permits and indeed encourages easy access to guns. Those who argue she should learn to shoot are missing the point. The point is that there is no sensible reason to allow citizens do buy firearms in the way our national, piecemeal state by state system functions. She did not buy the gun for self protection. She bought the gun to demonstrate the idiocy of a system that allows just anybody to legally purchase a weapon of gross destruction. Our society is awash with guns. You gotta believe most people who own them have no idea how to use them. Let’s change the system. Reply More evidence that Epi is right that these people are animists. HAHAHAHAHA! I needed help. I drove to where a police officer had pulled over another driver. Now, writing this, I realize that rolling up on an on-duty cop with a handgun in tow might not have been fully thought through. I told him I just bought a gun, had no clue how to use it. I asked him to make sure there were no bullets in the magazine or chamber. He took the magazine out and cleared the chamber. He assured me it was empty and showed me how to look. Then he told me how great the gun was and how he had one just like it. The cop thought I was an idiot and suggested I take a class. But up to that point I’d done nothing wrong, nothing illegal. HAHAHAHAHA! Oh man, surprised she didn’t roll up to the cop, fumbling with the gun saying, “Officer! How do I put the thingy in the thingy?! Does it have bullets in the…” BLAM! BLAM! Police Officer: STOP RESISTING!!!! Oooh, more yummy, sweet projection: Again (see my comments above): not everyone who buys a gun knows how to use it. There is no check on that whatsoever. Now she can take it to starbucks and shoot kids by accident (or not by accident, whatever she feels like actually, maybe she hs a hell of a day and gets a little crazy). I wonder if the author of the piece would use her scary gun if she actually had a home invasion during her little experiment. Or will she just shoot her kid to make a political point. They keep talking about all these people who could potentially shoot someone because they “have no training,” and how easy it is to obtain a gun. Why, you’d almost believe there are millions of untrained people carrying guns into Starbucks everyday. And yet I never hear the news story about how some moron accidentally shot someone at the grocery store or coffee house or playground. Why, it’s almost as though they have no idea what they’re talking about. But was she born a woman? Look at ’em paws, man… Reminds me of something. I’m going to say….no. Potential mate for Steve Smith or Ben Roethlisberger. My Month With a Gun: Week One Tune in again next week, after she’s been confronted by a dude who dared her to shoot him or get raped. We have to keep up with this story. I’m predicting and exponential rise in lulz as the month goes on. Let me go ahead and deconstruct this sophist article for you. We have a mentally inept and possibly retarded left-winger, who doesn’t want a gun for any reason pertaining to its use, buy a gun without doing any research or having any intent on training with said gun. An analog to this would be someone buying a sports car,then towing it to their drive way and (without turning it on for fear of the car going through his/her garage and into the neighbors house and bursting into flames) sitting in the drivers seat playing race car driver. Now, can anyone show me a person who does this that isn’t a complete hack or mentally disabled? It is because they are fixated on the object. Gun is just another in the endless stream of scapegoats human beings have been using to better cope with things they can’t change. In the past people would fixate on witches or certain kinds of animals and such to explain bad harvests and other things they couldn’t control or understand. Today we have the fact that at any moment some nut somewhere can go crazy and kill a few people. And just like bad harvests back in the day, there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. So these people fixate on something they think they can control. They then accuse gunowners of fetishizing firearms. And did you know that you can walk onto ANY car lot and they’ll sell you a 4000lb death machine without any evidence of training or a permission slip from the government?!? The very same object that kills 30,000+ Americans every year! O M G ! “[…] a Glock doesn’t have an external safety feature, […]” Not true, the safety is located on the trigger. Bet you a Dollar to a donut that before she first used Office, she took a course on how to use the component parts (Excel for Dummies). But do that with a firearm….. that would be crazy. If I recall correctly, this morning Donna Brazile claimed (with no supporting evidence whatsoever) there have been something like fourteen “mass shootings” since Newtown. As usual, nobody called her on it. I was too scared to try and eject it as thoughts flooded my mind of me accidentally shooting the gun and a bullet hitting my son in the house or rupturing the gas tank of my car, followed by an earth-shaking explosion. GET OUT! GET OUT NOW! IT’S RIGHT THERE IN THE HOUSE WITH YOU!!!!! I’m sure from this day forward she will be on disability, unable to work do to constant fear caused by this terrifying traumatic experience. She did not buy the gun for self protection. She bought the gun to demonstrate the idiocy of a system that allows just anybody to legally purchase a weapon of gross destruction. Apparently, even on the Montana concealed carry application there is a “Why do you need this?” question. I don’t feel the need for one, so I have never seen a copy of the application. Any time the topic comes up, I suggest they put down, “Because THIS IS AMERICA.” “Ask me again and you’ll find out!” Today, they have a woman with absolutely no firearms training and a Glock on her hip sitting within arm’s reach of small children, her hands shaking and adrenaline surging. “I’m a moron; loud and proud. Hear me roar.” The narrative is set way before the events happen. If gun control is the narrative, then no matter what the actual facts are in any given tragedy, the events will be broadcast in such a way as to support that narrative. There’s a narrative about how rednecks are bad people, too. How they hate gay people and how we should take their guns away. To whatever extent the president conforms to the narrative, that’s the extent to which he can influence the narrative. That’s how, for instance, the president got a free pass to give AR-15s to Islamists in Syria–it was partially because he conformed to the narrative by trying to take AR-15s away from Americans. It’s all about conforming to the MSM’s narrative in most ways as closely as possible. In Syria, it’s all good; there are no Bitter Clingers there. This is the Best article I have read on the subject. Absolutely right. The war-zone levels of daily nonnewsworthy incidents of gun violence in this country, of course, should play more of a role in the gun control debate. Fuck off, sockpuppet. Hey, Tony! I’m still waiting for you to apologize for lying about the Oath Keepers and calling me a “quasi-White Supremacist” because I’m a member. Or does being Tony mean never having to say you’re sorry? Oh, and you’re lying through your teeth about the “daily war-zone levels” of gun violence. You have no fucking idea of what a “war-zone” is. I could introduce you to some of my Libyan, Syrian, Sudanese, or Bosnian students who do, though. Though, I doubt they would look kindly on your hyperbole. Not to mention, that any place a person would call a “war zone” in the U.S. would be right in the middle of a democratically controlled urban area. Yeah sure, Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Philly, L.A., New Orleans, Gary, etc, etc are war zones, but they sure as hell weren’t made that way by libertarians or libertarian policy. You own them, Tony. Not to mention, that any place a person would call a “war zone” in the U.S. would be right in the middle of a democratically controlled urban area. You mean down in the holla, drunken good ol’ boys aren’t daily, nay, hourly, shooting at each other like the Hatfields and the McCoys? MY TELEVISION IS A LIE!!!! Only when Marshal Raylan Givens is out of the county. I remember back in ’96 when Virginia was upgrading its concealed-carry law from “may issue” to “shall issue”. So many anti-gunners were wetting their pants you could smell the urine stink all over the state (especially in northern VA, where anti-gun judges had pointedly refused to issue permits no matter how good the reason it was requested). They not only whined their usual whine that Virginia would become “the Wild West” (which of course didn’t really exist), there was even a Washington Post op ed that said that Virginia would become “Beirut”. I was in Beirut in the fall of ’83 with the SHTF; those idiots at the WaPo probably didn’t even know where Beirut was. I have friends from Sarajevo. You, like most left-wingers on this subject, insult people who have actually lived through wars. The war-zone levels of daily nonnewsworthy incidents of gun violence in this country, of course, should play more of a role in the gun control debate. You’re right, although not for the reason you think. Yes, let’s look at those incidents of violence: who is perpetrating them, and why. And also look at who’s not perpetrating them. Then we’ll see if your narrative about the causes of the violence holds up. My only comment is that the word “event” should be purged from the English language. What does the wishy, washy, vapid and wimpy word “event” add to any of the following descriptions: Snow event, rain event, meeting event, social event, accident event, nuclear event, sunshine event, heart event (my favorite all time big pharma doublespeak term for heart attack as a !possible! side effect) and now may we present you with…..a shooting event. I feel like having an event event. Hear, hear! An “event” is my cousin’s wedding. On the way to my daughter’s dance recital today, I drove a road I don’t normally take and I noticed that in my little region of suburban/exurban New Hampshire there were two new gun stores along a road that already had two others. We’re winning. I drove a road … HYPOCRITE! SOMALIA!!! UURRRUUGGHGHHBLAAAA! Me & my boyfriend was planning to get married last month, just last week we had some argument that made him get angry on me just because of the argument, he said we will not be married again and the next day he left me and we broke up. I still loved him and I wanted him to marry me, for me to get him back i had no choice than to contacted dr.marnish@yahoo.com to help me and he helped me to bring my lover back to me so we can continue our plan to be married. he came back after 3 days Shelley Dustin Spain What we have in all of the incidents mentioned by the author, is a fall-out from living in a free society, where no one is guaranteed a risk-free life, but many assume that there are no negative consequences to be wary of. We have lost the ability to be of aware of our surroundings, and the risk contained therein, to a great degree. We tell people who complain about unfairness that it is not written anywhere that life is fair. It is not without risk either. Not so good. The right idea, but inconsistent application. One would think that a piece posted under the heading “Reason” wouldn’t fall for the simplest trick of reason’s enemies. That trick is the obfuscation of terms. Sloppy terminology leads to sloppy argument and sloppy thinking, and sloppy thinking is a weapon against reason, fact and logic. I refer to the inconsistent and misleading use of the scare term “assault weapon” and its assumed synonymity with “assault rifle”. We’ve been explaining the distinction to the press for DECADES and, by this point, it’s pretty clear that they all know about it but perpetuate the confusion deliberately. So what’s Reason’s excuse? The gun-control crowd started calling ordinary semi-auto rifles “assault rifles” solely to scare the public and stampede them into support for proposed legislation. Surely you’ve heard well-meaning but ignorant types say “I don’t support overzealous gun control, but something has to be done about these assault rifles.” However, the phrase “assault rifle” has had a fairly specific and standardized meaning since the 1940s. And that has caused two problems for the gun controllers. (1) Ordinary semi-auto rifles such as the type you can buy at WalMart or gun shows are NOT assault rifles, and (2) These people aren’t really after rifles; it’s handguns they want to control. After all, “Handgun Control Inc” wasn’t called “Rifle Control Inc”. Now even the most uninformed voter or newspaper hack realizes that “assault rifle” has something to do with rifles, not handguns. So “assault rifle” just won’t do. Enter the mythical term “assault weapon”. Nobody knows what an “assault weapon” is. But that’s a feature, not a bug; since it means nothing, it can be understood to mean anything, anything they want. And what do they want? We can only guess, since when they say “assault weapon” they mean something else. Concern with terminology is not to be slighted as mere pedanticism. When one can’t even agree on the terms, then one can hardly expect to agree on the concepts. If a town was having a debate over policy re packs of stray dogs, but the local press kept calling dogs “cats”, that certainly wouldn’t clarify matters. And it would have no effect on the real world, either; calling Fido a cat doesn’t magically transform him into Morris. Just as calling a semi-auto rifle an “assault rifle” doesn’t turn it into one. The only way to deal with an issue is to be honest about terms; those who won’t are probably not interested in being honest about concepts, either. Please log in to post comments Liz Wolfe

6.19.2013 9:00 AM Vice President Joe Biden insisted to a subdued audience Tuesday that he and President Barack Obama ""haven't given up"" on gun control. But his remarks came at the first White House event since the Senate's failed April 17 background checks vote. And all that he had to show gun control supporters by way of progress was a list of completed or mostly completed executive actions — and a set of new guidebooks for churches and schools on how to deal with a mass shooting situation.

The suspect had a duffel bag loaded with 1,300 rounds of ammunition and extra weaponry, Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks told reporters Saturday. Such an arsenal points to a planned attack, she said. ""Any time someone puts on a vest, of some sort, comes out with a bag full of loaded magazines, has an extra receiver, has a handgun and has a semi-automatic rifle, carjacks folks, goes to a college, kills more people and has to be neutralized at the hands of the police, I would say that that's premeditated,"" said Seabrooks. Seabrooks added that the gunman had a previous encounter with the police s even years ago, but she couldn't elaborate because the suspect was a juvenile when the incident occurred. Seabrooks did not identify the killer because his next of kin is out of the country, but she said he would have turned 24 on Saturday. Santa Monica Police Sgt. Richard Lewis said in a news briefing late Friday that a lone gunman carried out the shootings, which resulted in nine crime scenes that spanned several blocks. ""It's a horrific event everyone wishes didn't happen,"" Lewis told the press. Lewis also confirmed a ""person of interest,"" who was taken into custody earlier in the day, ""has been released and is not a suspect."" One of the dead was shot outside the library of the two-year college, where students were studying for or taking final exams. The gunman, who was not immediately identified, was described as white or Latino with curly hair and 20 to 30 years old. Witnesses said he was dressed in black, wore body armor and a helmet and brandished a military-style assault rifle, a shotgun, a handgun and an ammunition belt. He was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police in the library as students dived for cover or ran for safety. Lewis said. Beforehand, students, many wearing headphones, either did not hear or ignored several ""pops."" The 38-acre main campus remained locked down throughout the afternoon while the bomb squad examined suspicious bags the gunman left behind. The gunman was found with a canvas bag that included a rifle, a handgun and magazines of ammunition, The lockdown was lifted late Friday, but the school remains closed. Three women in a car were shot and wounded during what the Santa Monica police called a ""series of random encounters."" One later died at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Another victim was in critical condition and one was in fair condition Friday night, the university hospital said. Three other women, including one shot in a car, were treated for minor injuries at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica. One had shrapnel-type injuries and the two others had injuries not related to gunfire. All were treated and released. The series of incidents -- Santa Monica police said at least nine -- began when a gunman shot up and set fire to a home located about a mile from campus. Capt. Jason Wells, of the Santa Monica Fire Department, said late Friday that the cause of the fire is undetermined, but is being investigated due to the suspicious circumstances. Two bodies were found in the house on Yorkshire Avenue, a fire department spokesman told the Associated Press. At least one of the two men died from gunshots, sources told KABC-TV. Two officials told the Associated Press that the killings began as a domestic violence incident and the victims in the home were the gunman's father and brother. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case. Jerry Cunningham Rathner, who lives nearby, told AP that she heard gunshots shortly before noon and then saw a man shooting at the neighbors' home. The residence quickly erupted in flames and billowing smoke. She said the gunman then went to the corner and pointed a military-style rifle at a woman in a car, ordering her to pull over. He then motioned to another car to slow down before opening fire. ""He fired three to four shots into the car -- boom, boom, boom, right at her,"" Rathner told AP, adding the the driver was wounded only in the shoulder. The gunman then carjacked a woman and directed her to drive to the college campus, having her stop so he could shoot along the way, police said. He shot at other vehicles on Pico Boulevard, including a transit bus and police vehicle. ""This guy just stepped out with a big rifle,"" Santa Monica College student Marta Fagerstroem, who was aboard the Metro bus, told KNBC-TV. The gunman then fled, and police believe he went on to shoot several others along the Pico Boulevard area. One shooting occurred at 28th Street and Pico Boulevard, followed by one slaying at Pico and Cloverfield boulevards and two more near 19th and Pearl streets. KABC-TV reported that another shooting, believed to be related, was reported on 21st Street, just east of campus. A witness said a man dressed in black got out of a vehicle and started shooting indiscriminately in the intersection. The gunman eventually made his way onto campus. A lockdown was ordered and police evacuated some students. Trena Johnson, a longtime administrative assistant working in the dean's office, looked out the window around noon Friday and saw a man with a ""very large gun."" ""We saw a woman get shot in the head,"" said Johnson. ""I haven't been able to stop shaking."" In a staff parking lot, college employee Joe Orcutt said he saw the gunman standing calmly with his weapon, looking as though he was trying to determine which people to shoot at. ""I turn around and that's when he's just standing there, like he's modeling for some ammo magazine,"" Orcutt said. ""He was very calm just standing there, panning around, seeing who he could shoot, one bullet at a time, like target practice."" Jimes Gillespie, who was studying in the library, told the Associated Press that he saw a gunman with a shotgun but also heard gunfire from a handgun. Sam Luster was preparing for a presentation when he heard gunfire. ""We didn't know what was happening until all the students at the entrance of the library started running down towards the bottom of the library,"" he told KABC-TV. He then took cover under a desk before heading to the exit, where he heard multiple gun shots. Chad Lazzari said several hundred students ran to a door that was locked on one side, causing panic. He said a car parked in the middle of the campus was riddled with bullets. The college, with an enrollment of about 34,000, canceled afternoon and evening final exams at the main campus. All Santa Monica city schools were also placed on lockdown. The day's violence occurred about three miles from where President Obama was appearing at a Democratic fundraiser. Authorities do not believe it was related to the president's visit. Obama was scheduled to helicopter back to the Los Angeles airport but instead traveled by motorcade ""to avoid any impact on the ongoing local response to the shooting in the area,"" the White House press office said. This is the latest in a series of recent mass-shootings, and the incident may rekindle the debate over gun control. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released a statement citing reports that the shooter used a semi-automatic rifle similar to those used in the shootings in Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. ""This is the seventh mass shooting in the last year,"" Waxman's statement read. ""Enough is enough. It's well past time that Congress take action to keep these dangerous weapons off our streets.""

        Ruby Cramer Posted on July 2, 2013, at 4:33 p.m. ET Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the gun control movement's most active and affluent advocate, will host a fundraiser at his Manhattan home later this month for Sen. Joe Manchin, according to an invitation for the event obtained by BuzzFeed. Manchin, a Democrat from Republican-leaning West Virginia, led the Senate's push for a bill to expand background checks on private gun sales earlier this year in the wake of the mass shooting last December in Newtown, Conn. Manchin's bill, co-sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, failed despite backing from the White House and Bloomberg's own group, Mayor's Against Illegal Guns. The fundraiser, scheduled for July 22, marks Bloomberg's efforts to reward those who supported the gun control campaign and punish those senators who voted against it, including four Democratic senators: Montana's Max Baucus, Alaska's Mark Begich, North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp, and Arkansas' Mark Pryor. Last month, the New York City mayor appealed to state donors to cut off contributions to the four lawmakers. Manchin, once an ally of the National Rifle Association, isn't up for reelection for another five years, but will likely be one of the gun lobby's biggest targets come 2018. Tickets for the Bloomberg event start at $1,000. Correction: Manchin is up for reelection in 2018. An earlier version of this article misstated the year.

1802216350,2013-06-13 12:32:23,"Samuel Granillo, Columbine High School Shooting Survivor, Opens Up About Massacre (VIDEO)",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/samuel-granillo-columbine_n_3039714,en,False,education and schools,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost In March, The Huffington Post began talking to teens and adults throughout the U.S. about their experiences with gun violence. This is one individual's story. You can read others here. Fourteen years ago, on the morning of April 20, 1999, seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, set off bombs, murdered 12 classmates and a teacher, injured 24 more, and then ultimately took their own lives at Columbine High School -- all in the span of 49 minutes, in what has remained one of the bloodiest mass shootings in American history. Samuel Granillo was a 17-year-old junior at Columbine High School when the massacre occurred. Now 31, Granillo says he is still recovering from the psychological scars left from that day. Tragically, on July 20, 2012, Granillo relived much of that pain when a gunman opened fire on an unsuspecting audience -- one that included several of his friends -- at the Century 16 theater in Aurora, Colo., during a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Fifty-eight people were injured and 12 were killed, including Granillo's friend, 24-year-old Alex Teves. In a detailed interview with The Huffington Post, Granillo opens up about what happened to him during the Columbine shooting and what continues to haunt him to this day, as well as the trauma of losing a friend to gun violence in another mass shooting so close to home. Watch Part 1 of the Samuel Granillo interview (story continues below video): *** Granillo was one of 17 people at Columbine High School barricaded in an office near the school's cafeteria, where much of the massacre took place. The students quickly noticed that there was no lock on the office door, so Granillo shoved his toes into the bottom of the door and laid on the ground to use his body weight to wedge it shut. ""A couple minutes later the doorknob turns,"" Granillo recalled. ""And it's just like in a horror movie almost, when you're trying to be quiet and the doorknob starts to turn and you know what's on the other side. And everyone in my room, which was a tiny office, started pushing on my knees and shoulders trying to brace me. We were fighting the door shut against the shooters."" Granillo says that it was a quiet struggle in that room trying to keep the door shut, and that there were no words exchanged between the 17 people hiding and the people they heard outside. He cannot be sure who was on the other side of the door, but assumes it was Klebold and Harris. ""It wasn't somebody looking for safety, it wasn't anyone saying, 'Please let me in, I need a place to hide' -- it was quiet and angry feeling,"" he said. The people outside the door managed to force it open a couple of inches, but never fired any shots at it. And suddenly they stopped pushing, Granillo recalled. ""They sort of gave up, I don't know what happened, but I could hear them talking outside the door and I don't know who else it would have been. It was the weirdest tone of voice -- it was so casual, there was no panic in the voice, they weren't angry. It was just two people talking. ""And the voices sort of faded away, and as they did, more and more gunshots and explosions started going off in the distance. We could sort of tell how far away they were from the distance of the noise, and when we felt they were far enough away, as fast as we could we built a barricade against the door with everything in the room."" For a tense three and a half hours, Granillo and the others in the group hid in the office, some talking on the phone to police officers outside the school. Eventually a SWAT team arrived to rescue them and help them escape. Watch Part 2 of the Samuel Granillo interview (story continues below video): Despite having heard the sounds of gunfire and explosions, they did not yet know exactly what had happened right outside the office walls. As they exited the room and headed toward a broken window to escape, Granillo says they began to take in the full scope of the tragedy that had unfolded. ""No one really knew what was going on,"" he said. ""I'm thinking the whole time hopefully everything is okay, but I look up into the cafeteria and see it just destroyed: Tables are turned upside down, smoke everywhere, broken glass, flipped up chairs, puddles of water."" When Granillo stepped outside, he immediately saw a body at the bottom of the stairs at the side of the school. ""I just stared at [the body], it didn't look like a person really, it sort of just looked like an animal on the side of the road -- you could see the humanity was gone, they had died before they even hit the ground."" Officials then began to let Granillo and other students still leaving the school run up a nearby hill to safety. ""I run up the hill and I look down and there's a girl who had been killed laying on her back -- which was my friend Rachel. I didn't know that at the time -- and I almost tripped over her,"" Granillo said, referring to Rachel Scott, a 17-year-old student who was shot to death on the lawn along the west entrance to the school while eating lunch with friend Richard Castaldo. ""There were some cop cars nearby and that's how we eventually got away from the school, but that's not at all where it ended,"" he said. ""The rest of the day was just filled with chaos trying to figure out what happened, who was okay, who got killed, trying to find parents, trying to piece stories together."" Granillo says he didn't find his mother until around 4 p.m. that day. ""The second I saw her, I finally broke down and started crying. That's when I finally knew that I was safe, or felt safe."" The next month was a blur for Granillo. The combination of finishing school, going to funeral after funeral for murdered classmates, and making hospital visits for the wounded left him deeply traumatized. He says that even though he loathes what Klebold and Harris did that day, he doesn't hate them as people. ""No matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to hate them. I hate what they did, what they did was scary, it changed my life, it destroyed others -- it was really awful. But I can't hate them as individuals. It's a hard thing for people to believe or understand."" He is still wavering on forgiveness. ""I don't know, that's a hard thing to forgive, but it doesn't mean I can't look past it. Forgiveness may be out of the question, maybe, but I just don't think forgiveness is the right word. It's more complex than that for me. Way deeper."" Granillo is currently working on a documentary about the Columbine shooting as told from the perspective of survivors.

This is one individual's story. You can read others here. Fourteen years ago, on the morning of April 20, 1999, seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, set off bombs, murdered 12 classmates and a teacher, injured 24 more, and then ultimately took their own lives at Columbine High School -- all in the span of 49 minutes, in what has remained one of the bloodiest mass shootings in American history.

But this isn’t the first time he’s found himself at the center of an international news story. When he was 8, Murray’s Scottish elementary school was the scene of a horrific mass shooting—the Dunblane massacre. 15 five-year-olds and a 6-year-old were shot and killed along with their teacher by 43-year-old
                                        Thomas Hamilton, a store owner and former youth club leader who entered the school armed with four handguns. It remains one of the deadliest criminal acts involving firearms in British history and inspired sweeping
                                        gun legislation, which effectively made private ownership of handguns illegal in the U.K. In the BBC documentary “Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racket,” which aired this week, Murray, who has been described by the British press as
                                        a stoic figure, broke down in tears as he recalled hiding under a desk and sheltering his brother as shots rang out. “You have no idea how tough something like that is,” he said, gripping his dog for
                                        support while trying to contain his emotions. His mother, Judy Murray, is just as traumatized by the massacre 17 years ago. “I was one of hundreds of mums that were queuing up at the school gates waiting to find out what had happened, not knowing if your
                                        children were alive or not,” she recalled, adding that, even now, she cannot go near the building where the murders took place. Murray’s victory has given Dunblane reason to celebrate—and feel empowered once again. “It’s just nice being able to do something the
                                        town is proud of,” he said. Indeed, after Sunday’s stunning victory, one resident told the Guardian,
                                        “Andy’s exorcised a ghost in Dunblane.” Here is today’s report. —Jennifer Mascia Ray-twon Briggs, 4, died after being shot in his home on the north side of Youngstown, Ohio, Sunday night. Briggs’s grandmother told police the boy was playing with one of three handguns in the house when he
                                        fatally shot himself in the head. Two other children, ages 1 and 5, were also in the room. The boy’s parents were not home at the time of the shooting. —WKBN Three people, including a 15-year-old boy, were shot to death in separate incidents on the West Side of Chicago, Ill., Monday afternoon.

B. Todd Jones ""was a bit older, a bit wiser, already married,"" said Mark Myhra, a fellow Marine officer who later recruited Jones to a Minneapolis law firm. ""He was looked up to because he was a responsible family man, but he was also able to be one of the guys. B.T. was an affable fellow who never took himself too seriously."" ""B.T."" ultimately did pursue that legal career, mixing private practice with three stints at the U.S. attorney's office in Minneapolis - two of them as U.S. attorney. And on Wednesday, Jones earned a niche in Washington political history by becoming the first Senate-confirmed permanent director of the often-controversial Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Texans voted no Much like his four predecessors who served as ""acting"" directors of the agency, Jones had faced major turbulence on the road to what turned out to be a marathon confirmation process, culminating in a 53-42 vote in Jones' favor. Both U.S. senators from Texas, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, voted against his nomination. The nomination's opposition melted just enough when the National Rifle Association, the agency's longtime foe gun-law enforcement, signaled this week it would stay neutral on Jones. President Barack Obama nominated Jones, 56, to be the agency's permanent director in January, just a month after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which took the lives of 20 children and six adults. As acting director since September 2011, Jones has attempted to enforce e discipline on a bureau notorious for its laissez-faire approach to law enforcement hierarchy. Jones arrived as ""an agent of change"" and found ""an agency in distress,"" as he told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June during his confirmation hearing. ""Poor morale undermined the efforts of the overwhelming majority of ATF."" Within a month of his arrival, Jones cleaned house. He demoted two senior bureau managers who oversaw Operation Fast and Furious, in which Phoenix-based agents were instructed to stand by while Mexican drug-cartel intermediaries bought more than 2,000 AK-47s and other semi-automatic weapons and ferried them south of the border. Jones fired William McMahon, who was assistant director in charge of field operations during Fast andFurious. And he elevated Thomas Brandon, veteran agent and manager, to be his No. 2. Last year, in a sternly worded video to agency personnel, Jones warned ""there will be consequences"" for employees who complain outside the bureau's chain of command. Internal upheaval He also replaced 22 of 25 special agents in charge of agency field divisions and directed his new team ""to move ATF forward in its mission to fight violent crime and protect the American public."" But so much upheaval in such a short period produced a different set of consequences. Last year, two of Jones' hand-picked assistant directors departed. Larry Ford, the assistant director in charge of all field operations, returned to Chicago to resume a previous post as special agent in charge of the division there. And after a series of miscues, Gregory Gant accepted a lesser position as assistant special agent in charge at the Kansas City office. At the confirmation hearing, Jones was unapologetic for his management style, which an anonymous letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee had described as ""Orwellian."" The letter from unidentified employees of the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office also stated that Jones had instilled a ""climate of fear."" ""Change is hard sometimes for individuals to deal with,"" he told senators. ""And I've always had a focus on doing the right thing for the right reasons, and sometimes folks are not happy about the direction overall."""

A gathering of people from all around our country with one thing in common: a desire to stop the gun violence that plagues their lives and continues to plague our nation. Marking the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting in a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, young Sikhs of Oak Creek organized a candlelight vigil against gun violence at the same gurdwara where six people were murdered. One would anticipate the one-year anniversary vigil to be small and somber. Most people I meet know Aurora and Newtown but draw a blank when they hear Oak Creek. It simply blurs into the string of horrific mass shootings last year that each time failed to yield the solutions to gun violence that we were desperate for. And yet, more than 1,000 people of all faiths and backgrounds gathered in Wisconsin for the vigil with many more watching online. Holding candles and wearing scarves and turbans in solidarity, they listened to survivor stories of Oak Creek and other national tragedies, from Virginia Tech to Newtown. Rather than a solemn affair, the Sikh Americans of Oak Creek interwove tearful testimonies with multifaith prayer and music, stories and songs that repeatedly lifted up the Sikh spirit of ""Chardi Kala,"" everlasting optimism and high spirits even in hardship and suffering. The Oak Creek mass shooting was a national tragedy. It was the biggest act of violence against a faith community since the 1963 Alabama church bombings. But it is also a story of how a community got up from being floored and organized for concrete social and political change. In a time when many who want gun violence prevention legislation are frustrated and tempted to give up, Oak Creek offers hope and inspiration. Immediately after the mass shooting, the Sikh community rightly understood the Oak Creek tragedy was part of a history of discrimination on the basis of race and religion. Sikhs in Oak Creek joined civil rights groups and allies in a national grassroots campaign calling for the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs and others vulnerable to violence. Their work resulted in a historic Senate hearing on the rise of domestic terrorism and hate crimes in America. On September 19, 2012, Harpreet Singh Saini, a teenager whose mother was gunned down in the prayer hall, became the first Sikh in U.S. history to testify before Congress. ""I want to protect other people from what happened to my mother,"" Harpreet said. ""I want to combat hate, not just against Sikhs but against all people. Senators, I know what happened at Oak Creek was not an isolated incident. I fear it may happen again if we don't stand up and do something."" Harpreet asked the government to give his mother the dignity of being counted in hate crimes statistics. On Friday, after a year of concerted organizing, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice will finally begin to track hate crimes against Sikh Americans, Hindus, Arabs, Buddhists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Orthodox Christians. They will be counted on the Hate Crime Incident Report form for the first time. Although adding categories to an incident report might seem like a minor improvement, it is not. It's impossible to combat the problem of hate-based violence in America without acknowledging that it exists. The policy change is an important crime-fighting tool and a civil rights victory for a community that has suffered discrimination, especially since 9/11. Quick action that galvanized Oak Creek in the wake of tragedy helped get this done. But it was also the result of more than a decade of sustained effort by determined community advocates, such as the Sikh Coalition, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund and South Asian Americans Leading Together. Now, some Sikh Americans are joining the movement against gun violence for the first time.  Amardeep Singh Kaleka, whose father Satwant Singh Kaleka was killed fighting the gunman in the shooting, has become a prominent voice against gun violence. His brother, Pardeep Singh Kaleka,  teamed up with former white supremacist Arno Michaelis to educate young people about the roots of violence. They helped the Sikh youth of Oak Creek found Serve2Unite in the aftermath of the mass shooting. Watch ""Oak Creek: In Memoriam,"" a short film about tragedy and healing ""We refused to let that act define what we became,"" said Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi. ""We can accomplish something. We can make a change that's real. We don't have to wait for Washington or someone else to do it."" As a Sikh American, I was deeply inspired that the vigil honored all victims of gun violence. The ceremony began and ended with a reading of the names of people murdered by guns -- a school in Newtown, a theater in Aurora, the streets of Chicago and daily homicides that barely make headlines. Between stories of victims, the drums of Native American tribes flowed into Sikh prayers and the voices of a children's choir. The vigil also featured an array of representatives from some 45 groups who worked with Sikhs since the tragedy, including Groundswell at Auburn Seminary, a multifaith social action network of 100,000 people of faith I helped found. The movement against gun violence has not fizzled out. Even in the midst of the distractions of the next day's news cycle, we must remain focused in the pursuit of solutions that make our streets and schools, homes and houses of worship, safer for all. Young Sikh Americans are among the many new voices that can re-energize  the movement. After all, the story of Oak Creek teaches us the way forward beyond the passage of reasonable legislation such as background checks. It reminds us to focus on curbing the impulse to violence and hate in our own homes and hearts. And it shows us how to keep working even when times are bleak -- in Chardi Kala, a spirit of relentless optimism.

But Maj. Nidal Hasan insisted there's more to the story. More from GlobalPost: Nidal Hasan, Fort Hood shooting suspect, can't claim 'defense of others' Acting as his own attorney, Hasan told the court in Texas he plans to call two defense witnesses and also cited his religion as a possible defense but did not elaborate. He said the evidence will show ""that we are imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion... I apologize for any mistakes I made in this endeavor."" Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in the 2009 attack -- the deadliest mass shooting ever on a US military base. Prosecutors say Hasan targeted ""those wearing the uniform"" during his rampage because he did not want to be deployed. More from GlobalPost: Fort Hood shooting suspect denied delay to trial They claim he methodically prepared for the attack by practicing at a local shooting range, making frequent visits to a gun store to stock up on ammunition and studying the schedule of the building he carried out the shooting in. Hasan also plans to cross-examine victims of the rampage himself. “I will be cross-examined by the man who shot me,” Staff Sgt. Alonzo M. Lunsford Jr., 46, who retired from the Army and remains blind in his left eye from the shooting, told The New York Times. “You can imagine all the emotions that are going to be coming up.” Hasan could receive the death penalty if convicted.

Start at the post box at the top, in the shadow of the cathedral, painted in honor — or, rather, honour — of Andy Murray’s Olympic gold medal. A butcher has his sign with Murray’s name and picture, a baker has a banner and on down High Street — a boutique and a cafe, a newsstand and a realtor, virtually every storefront with one “Well done” or another. Scotland has forever been the home of golf, and that fact will be undeniable this week at Muirfield, where the weather could change at any moment and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers — who founded this place in 1891 — will smile their wee smiles when it does. Scotland is also home to Murray, whose first Wimbledon championship came less than two weeks ago but whose visits to the beaches of the Bahamas with his girlfriend are now chronicled by the newspapers, enough to bump even the interminable wait for the royal baby. So there is something of a connection between these two unrelated events, the oldest championships in tennis and golf. They both now have a tartan tint, a new hero in one sport perhaps creating hope in another. “It gave the whole town a lift, all of Scotland a lift, really,” said Peter Meldrum, who owns the newsstand on the main street in Murray’s home town. “He’s doing it for the whole country.” It is, at its core, a complicated country, one that has wrestled with its own identity for centuries. Murray was universally recognized as the first British Wimbledon men’s champion in 77 years — never mind that no Scot had won in 117. But his narrative fits the staging of the 142nd Open as well. Scotsmen both founded the game and won the first 29 Open Championships. They won nine more before World War I. Yet they won just one between the two world wars. Since then, they have won two: Sandy Lyle in 1985 and Paul Lawrie in 1999. “Golf . . . has always had a baseline level of interest,” Nicol Hay, a Scotsman who writes on his country’s sport and culture, wrote in an e-mail. “It is a game that Scottish people actually play after all, and has a place in the general chatter of work and pubs and bookies. . . . “What golf has lacked though is a real Scottish interest at the sharp end. The closest thing we’ve had since Sandy Lyle is Colin Montgomerie, but he was never beloved enough to reach national hero status.” One reason, Hay wrote (joining Montgomerie’s failure to win a major championship and often prickly demeanor): “He doesn’t have a Scottish accent, which matters more than it should.” Such is the fragility of national pride, of who is a hero and who is not. Murray, who comes equipped with the right cadence, has become one. Lawrie once was, too, because when he won at Carnoustie, an hour from his Aberdeen home, “It was mad,” he said Tuesday. Lawrie watched the Wimbledon final at one of the junior tournaments sponsored by his foundation, which promotes the growth of golf for Scotland’s youth. The kids gathered round, rapt. “That’s what we want,” Lawrie said. “He’s inspirational, and we’re looking for guys like that.” He is particularly inspiring to Scots — or, perhaps, Scots can particularly relate to him — because of how he has handled his national identity. Scotland first joined England in a union in 1707, but the country maintained its own distinct culture and even fielded its own athletic teams. When “God Save the Queen” was played at Scottish football matches as recently as the 1980s, the British anthem was occasionally booed. It was replaced by “Flower of Scotland.” In 1999, the Scottish parliament reconvened, and the debate over nationalism and unification simmered. The latest vote for Scottish independence is scheduled for 2014, and Murray’s victory spurred columns and commentary wondering whether an increase in pride could impact the vote. As a rising young pro, Murray wore the Scottish flag on his wristbands. But he won his Olympic gold last summer at Wimbledon for Team GB, the marketing moniker used for the unified team of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and it was the Union Jack that was raised at his medal ceremony. His personality, though — raw and brave when he spoke through tears after losing the 2012 Wimbledon final, dour and self-critical after poor performances — speaks to Scots. “I think a lot of the reason why Andy Murray is as popular as he is, he had those few years where he wasn’t good enough,” said Martin Laird, a 30-year-old from Glasgow who has won three times on the PGA Tour and will play his third Open on Scottish soil. “‘Is he ever going to be any good? Is he fit enough?’ He kind of battled back from that, you know, and the Scottish people kind of think of themselves as underdogs. Football, rugby, golf, we’ve always kind of been the underdog. That’s what he was, and that’s what they appreciate.” In Dunblane, the appreciation is apparent at every turn. For so long, what the world knew of this affluent town of fewer than 9,000 residents had to do with a horrific mass shooting at Murray’s primary school, a spree that killed 16 children and their teacher in 1996. The town soldiered on, and Murray’s career helped bring attention for a newer, better reason. His victory over Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final completed that climb. “It kind of helped get a better reputation for Scotland,” said Cameron Christmas, a Dunblane native and a waiter at Café Continental on High Street. “The reputation can be that it’s just a dreary, rainy place. This kind of picked up everyone.” There are 10 Scotsman in the field here, each trying to do what Lyle did, what Lawrie did — in a way, what Murray did. The public expectations, though, won’t be for such a performance. Dunblane might be decorated from the cathedral to the school, but that doesn’t alter the basic tenets of the Scottish personality — pride in winning Wimbledon, pride in creating and hosting the Open aside. “We mostly don’t expect to win anything,” Hay wrote. “If we do, that’s great, but we’re not the sort of nation that go around worrying that we’re squandering potential if by and large we don’t have any.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."

              since The changes have failed to prevent subsequent mass shootings in Newton, Mass., Santa Monica, Calif., and other areas. Since the Aurora shooting, 126 people have died in 23 mass killings spread over 19 states, according to USA Today. Colorado saw some of the most significant changes. In May, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed a bill that allocates $20 million for an expansion of mental health services, including walk-in crisis centers, and a 24-hour hotline. Mental health issues have been linked to many mass shootings, and lawmakers hope that early intervention can get these people the help they need. The bill also creates a task force that will study ways to consolidate Colorado laws for placing a person in involuntary commitment for mental health treatment. Holmes' psychiatrist said he made ""homicidal statements"" and threatened her five weeks before the shooting. Colorado also passed a series of gun control measures, under fierce opposition from the state's strong gun lobby. The state passed a law limiting gun magazines to 15 rounds of ammunition, though sheriffs and firearms dealers are seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. Another bill passed Colorado's legislature that requires universal background checks for everyone who tries to buy a gun in the state, including private purchases between individuals. Colorado lawmakers also approved a measure that bans online certification for concealed carry permits. Gun control opponents have launched an effort to recall the Colorado Senate president for leading the effort to pass stricter regulations. Other states have made changes too following Aurora and other mass shootings, particularly in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. New York passed a sweeping package of mental health and gun control laws in January, which has been challenged by gun-rights groups. Earlier this month, a state appeals court rejected an attempt to block the law's implementation. Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, and California were among other states that strengthened gun laws in the wake of the shootings. These laws range from limiting magazine capacity, improving background checks, and keeping guns away from those who are dangerously mentally ill, according to the Los Angeles Times. Nationally, President Barack Obama signed 23 executive actions related to gun control and mental health regulations after Newtown. The White House has touted the implementation and progress of 21 of these executive actions — including federal agencies sharing more information within the federal background check system and directing the CDC to expand research into gun violence. Stricter laws on guns, however, fizzled in Congress. Most prominently, the Senate failed to pass a bill that would have expanded background checks on gun purchases, something that polls showed was favored by as much as 90% of the American public. Other changes after Aurora have come at the local level. Movie theaters around the country tightened security immediately after the theater shooting. Some banned costumes and masks, dispatched police officers to major movie theaters showing The Dark Knight Rises, and began offering active shooter training for movie theater employees. Finally, gun sales shot up after mass shooting sparked a panic in gun rights advocates who wanted to protect themselves and worried the government might make it harder to buy firearms.

Fearing that a return to the school would further traumatize the remaining students, the town has decided to raze the existing building. Planning and design for the new Sandy Hook school will be funded with a $750,000 grant from the state, said First Selectman Patricia Llorda. ""This was the first of two crucial steps in getting a new school built and it was a tremendous show of support by the community,"" Llorda said of a meeting late Wednesday where more than 150 people -- about ten times many people as usually attend town meetings -- crowded into the municipal chambers and unanimously approved the plan. The town has scheduled a public referendum for Oct. 5 where voters will approve or knock down a plan to spend an additional $50 million remaining from the state grant. Students, faculty and staff who survived the rampage have been moved to another school building in a neighboring town. The existing school, where 19-year-old Adam Lanza carried out his attack, will not be demolished until the final vote on the spending, Llorda said. Llodra said Sandy Hook School students will continue to attend Chalk Hill School in neighboring Monroe until June 2016. She said she expects the new school in Sandy Hook to open that September. School Board member John Vouros, a retired Newtown teacher, welcomed the news. ""Having taught here for 35 years, this was very important to me personally and to the entire school community and town,"" Vouros said. ""This shows the town is moving forward ... and this is a giant step."" (Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio)"

142949197,2013-07-30 11:53:43,Deputy to mentally ill gun buyer: Sale OK,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/usatoday-NewsTopStories/~3/kddR_0lxAIo/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"RENO, Nev. -- The sheriff's deputy who responded to a mother's 911 report that her mentally ill son ran off with a gun he bought from a police officer should have recognized the man was not allowed to have it and seized the weapon until the situation was sorted out, the Carson City sheriff said Tuesday. Instead, Washoe County Deputy John Graves told Jill Schaller that her son's gun purchase was legal and told the man he needed to show his parents that ""he can be a responsible gun owner,"" according to the deputy's report, acquired by the Reno Gazette-Journal through a public records request. A Gazette-Journal investigation found that, in fact, the man was prohibited from possessing a firearm because a judge had ruled in 2012 that his mental illness made him incompetent to care for himself. Under state and federal law, a person adjudicated as mentally ill can't have a gun. Schaller said Graves' statements, which turned out to be wrong, made it more difficult for them to convince their son that ""Mom and Dad were not just making this stuff up,"" and it was illegal for him to have a firearm. Reno police Sgt. Laura Conklin's sale of her personal gun while on duty to a mentally ill 19-year-old sparked debates about the lack of background-check requirements in private party sales. The Reno Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the sale, and the Sparks Police Department is conducting a criminal investigation. Because the investigations are ongoing, Sheriff Michael Haley said he could not comment on Graves' actions. Graves could not be reached for comment, and he did not respond to a request for comment made through the sheriff's department. Haley said that deputies are trained to know what types of people are disqualified from buying a gun. According to the July 7 report, Jill and Richard Schaller called for help after their son returned from vacation and ran out of the house with the gun he bought from Conklin. The Schallers said their son has Asperger's syndrome and was hospitalized in a mental health facility for making suicide threats, Graves said in his report. ""Due to these factors, Jill said she and Richard were granted continuing guardianship over him past the age of 18 by a Nevada court judge,"" Graves said, adding they ""were both extremely worried about (their son) either harming himself or possibly others as they indicated in the past he has shown signs of being homicidal, but they did not elaborate on those signs."" Armed with that information, ""bells should have gone off,"" Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said. ""That should have been his signal"" to check further into the situation to see if the young man was prohibited from possessing a gun. ""(Graves) should have taken the safe route and told the family, 'We're going to hold on to the gun overnight and sort this all out,'"" Furlong said. Instead, Graves and another deputy connected with Conklin and exchanged her money for the gun, according to the deputy's report. Graves said the Schallers were outraged and frustrated that their son was able to buy a gun in the first place, especially from a police officer. ""Jill told me she felt it was our duty to remove handguns from the streets and not introduce them,"" Graves wrote. ""I explained to Jill and Richard that even though the Glock was sold by a potentially on-duty police officer, the sale of the gun itself falls under private party gun sale laws,"" which made it legal. Graves said he spoke with the Schallers' son and ""he agreed to work with Jill and Richard and take steps towards showing them he can be a responsible gun owner."" Jill Schaller said Tuesday that the deputy's statements made the situation worse. ""That made it more confusing for (our son) because all of them were just saying, 'Sorry, your mom and dad said no,' instead of saying it was illegal,"" she said. If Graves had told the young man that he can't have a gun by law, ""he would have listened to them — they were people of authority,"" she said. ""Nobody told him it was illegal,"" until the Gazette-Journal investigation revealed his prohibited status, Schaller said. ""It took us like four or five days showing him the statute"" before he accepted that he could not have a gun. Furlong, who oversaw the response to a mass shooting at a Carson City IHOP restaurant by a mentally ill man in 2011, said law enforcement needs to focus its efforts toward understanding mental illnesses, and in this case, it was lucky no one was hurt. ""It just highlights the need for law enforcement and mental health to work more closely together,"" Furlong said. ""Just because a person has a mental illness does not mean he is a bad person. But they do have the probability of having an episode, and if there's a gun involved, it's a recipe for disaster."""

A gunman walked into a Gurdwara — a Sikh house of worship — and opened fire. He left six dead before killing himself, leaving a community and nation staggering to understand what had happened. With half the nation’s Sikh population living in California — San Jose’s has the largest Gurdwara in the country — the tragedy in Wisconsin struck close to home for many. Two young children, Abhay and his sister, Amanat, were sitting outside the Oak Creek Gurdwara on that Sunday morning when the shooter, identified as Wade Michael Page, opened fire. They ran to the kitchen to alert community members who had gathered to prepare Langar, a free community meal. Soon after, women in the kitchen heard gunshots outside and rushed their young children into a small, tiny pantry where a group of 16 remained for hours. After Oak Creek, parents spoke to their children about what they had seen or heard about the mass shooting. They listened closely, comforted the children, validated their feelings and attempted to reassure them. Many parents also spoke about their identity. As members of the world’s fifth largest religion, Sikhs are distinguished by their visible identity, which includes uncut hair that Sikh men are required to keep covered with a turban. (Sikh women also have the option of covering their hair with a turban.) The turban is an article of faith and represents a Sikh’s commitment to equality, religious pluralism and justice for all. This left many children asking: Why would someone want to hurt Americans simply because we looked different? Since 9/11, Sikh Americans continue to be targets of bias-based violence. Ninety nine percent of the people you see in this country wearing a turban are members of the Sikh faith. Consequently, Sikhs are often subjected to hate crimes, workplace discrimination, school bullying and racial profiling. In response to persistent attacks on Sikh Americans, 135 members of the U.S. Congress asked the FBI to begin tracking hate crimes against Sikhs. At a Senate Hearing, 18-year-old Harpreet Saini — the son of Paramjit Kaur Saini, the sole female who was killed at Oak Creek — testified about the need to do this. Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder finally announced that the FBI would begin formally tracking hate crimes against Sikhs and several other groups. Issues persist. Just in the past year, an 82-year-old Sikh man was attacked with a steel rod in Fresno, a Sikh business owner was shot and injured in Port Orange, Fla., and last week, a Gurdwara was vandalized in Riverside, where the word “Terrorist” was painted on the walls. We need to raise our voice to government officials, policymakers and the media ensuring Sikh Americans are no longer invisible members of our society. Yet we still have to explain to our children why they may be targeted. It is a conversation that no guardian should ever need to have. While Wade Michael Page acted alone, we fear that the beliefs he held are shared by many in our country. What we tell our children today, a year later, is that there is still progress to be made, but that we hope the next generation of Americans will truly experience equality as it was intended in our nation’s Constitution.

Hasan begins - soldier repping self tells jury 'the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter',http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/fort_hood_shootings_that_hasan_shooter_yAnvCrUirL4rCfMIRwKrJM?utm_medium=rss&utm_content=National,en,True,,7,New York Post,http://www.nypost.com/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. FORT HOOD, Texas — The Army psychiatrist accused in the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood targeted fellow soldiers in a meticulously planned attack that included stockpiling bullets and researching Taliban leaders calling for jihad, a military prosecutor said Tuesday during the opening day of the long-awaited trial. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan spent time at a shooting range and purchased a pistol and extender kit to hold more ammunition before carrying out his plan to “kill as many soldiers as he could” while avoiding civilians, Col. Steve Henricks told jurors. The shooting, which killed 13 people and injured more than 30 others on the sprawling Texas military base, remains the deadliest mass shooting ever on a US military installation. Henricks alleged that Hasan didn’t want to deploy after getting his orders about three weeks before the shootings, and that “he came to believe he had a jihad duty to murder to his fellow soldiers.” The American-born Muslim later told a doctor at the base that, “‘They’ve got another thing coming if they think they are going to deploy me,'” Henricks said. But when it came time for him to speak, the 42-year-old Hasan — who is acting as his own attorney — countered prosecutors’ detailed portrait of the attack with a simple statement: “The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.” In writings and in previous court statements, Hasan indicated he wanted to argue that he carried out the shooting to defend the Taliban from American attacks — but the judge denied that strategy. During his 2-minute opening statement Tuesday, he touched on his religion, saying: “We are imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion. … I apologize for any mistakes I made in this endeavor.” His statements highlighted the complexity of the military’s case. Hasan wanted to plead guilty to several counts of murder and attempted murder, but military rules prevent guilty pleas in death-penalty cases. Prosecutors are pursuing a death sentence, which are often overturned in military courts. The trial is playing out amid high security at Fort Hood, where armed guards stood in doorways and 15-foot stacks of shock-absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse. Jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months, and Hasan, who is in a wheelchair, needs regular breaks because he was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the shooting. On the day of the attack, Hasan sat among his fellow soldiers preparing to deploy at a building on the sprawling Army base. He had masked the sound of his equipment by stuffing paper towels into the pockets of his cargo pants, Henricks said. “All those fully loaded magazines do not clink, do not move, do not give him away,” the prosecutor told jurors, all military officers, during his opening statement. “He sits among the soldiers he’s about to kill with his head down.” Hasan tried to clear the area of civilians, even walking over to a civilian data clerk to tell her she was needed elsewhere in the building because a supervisor was looking for her. The prosecutor said the clerk thought that was odd but went anyway. “He then yelled ‘Allahu akbar!’ and opened fire on unarmed, unsuspecting and defenseless soldiers,” Henricks told the jury, noting that one of the soldiers who was killed had run after Hasan armed with only a chair. When Hasan left the building, a civilian approached him and asked what was going on. Hasan told him not to worry about it, and the civilian “walks away from the encounter unscathed,” the prosecutor said. Hasan allegedly told another civilian it was a training exercise. Hasan only shot at one civilian who tried to stop him, Henricks said. Henricks also said Hasan picked the date of the attack — Nov. 5, 2009 — for a specific reason, though he didn’t immediately reveal details. The first witnesses called by prosecutors worked at the gun shop where Hasan purchased his equipment, but Hasan chose not to question them. Dressed in green Army fatigues, Hasan mostly looked down or straight ahead, occasionally leafing through paperwork with his right hand while seated at the defense table. Numerous requests have delayed the trial for years, including a fight over Hasan’s beard, which violates military regulations. The spat led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and the eventual replacement of the judge. Hasan dismissed his attorneys earlier this year, and his brief opening statement on Tuesday mirrored his demeanor during jury selection last month when he did not speak often and asked only a few questions about religion. Over the next several weeks, Hasan is expected to question witnesses and possibly present his own evidence — which will likely turn the trial into a faceoff between the gunman and his victims. On the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded, plus dozens of others who were inside the post’s Soldier Readiness Processing Center. They’ve also said they saw Hasan shout “Allahu akbar!” — Arabic for “God is great!” — and opened fire on unarmed fellow soldiers. The government has said that Hasan had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical US-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Hasan has never denied carrying out the attack, and the facts of the case are mostly settled. But questions abound about how the trial will play out. How will Hasan question his victims? How will victims respond? How will his health hold up? The defendant is paralyzed from the waist down. He requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours, and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was wounded, is expected to testify. He said he looked forward to seeing Hasan, in a way. “I’m not going to dread anything. That’s a sign of fear,” Lunsford said. “That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again.” But Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning said he dreaded the expected confrontation. “I have to keep my composure and not go after the guy,” said Manning, a mental health specialist who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan with Hasan. “I’m not afraid of him, obviously. He’s a paralyzed guy in a wheelchair, but it’s sickening that he’s still living and breathing.” Share Selection"

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: CAIRO — The mass shooting of Islamist protesters by security forces Monday at a sit-in for ousted President Mohammed Morsi injected new outrage into the standoff over his removal by Egypt’s top generals, darkening hopes that they might reconcile the polarizing forces that have torn at the fabric of the country.
It was the deadliest day of violence since the revolt that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak in January 2011. 
Within a few hours around dawn, soldiers and police killed at least 51 people and wounded more than 400, almost all hit by gunfire, health officials said.
Army and police spokesmen said one soldier and two police officers were killed. 
But witnesses and video footage said one of the officers appeared to have been shot by soldiers, and the military provided little evidence to back its claim that the fighting had been instigated by the Islamists.
The scale and nature of the killings drove a deeper wedge between Morsi’s Islamist backers and their opponents, and diminished the chances that his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood might soon be coaxed back into a political process that they deem illegitimate after the military overthrew the elected president.
At the same time, the bloodshed sharpened a fierce debate about whether the new military-led interim government that replaced Morsi last week was moving toward a democracy or away from it. 
Two and a half years after the overthrow of Mubarak, the institutions, tactics and dynamics of the decades-old secular-authoritarian government seemed, at least for the moment, to snap back into place.
Some who denounced Mubarak’s use of force to silence critics were far more tepid about criticizing the killings of Morsi’s supporters, calling only for an inquiry to determine the root cause. The United States, which has conspicuously not condemned Morsi’s ouster, was also mild, calling on security forces to exercise restraint.
“Violence begets violence and should be strongly condemned,” Mohamed ElBaradei, the former diplomat and liberal leader, said in a statement on Twitter. “Independent investigation is a must.”
By contrast, Essam el-Erian, a senior Brotherhood leader, called the killings “an outright massacre” by “a fascist coup government.”
Leaders of the Brotherhood, Egypt’s largest Islamist group and best-organized political force, said the generals had now shown their authoritarian colors, using lethal weapons to crush dissent while holding the freely elected president captive. 
They called for a national “uprising” against the return of a military dictatorship.
Al-Nour, the only Islamist party that had backed the military’s takeover, suspended its participation in the interim government, accelerating the disintegration of Egyptian politics toward a culture war between Islamists and their foes.
The armed forces, on the other hand, claimed that Morsi’s supporters had attacked them first with rocks, gunfire and army-issued tear gas bombs, though dozens of witnesses — including some of Morsi’s opponents — disputed that account.
At a news conference, Ahmed Ali, a military spokesman, said the security forces had responded with rubber bullets and gas bombs after coming under attack by heavy gunfire.
He addressed a pointed question about human rights to Western critics: “What human rights are there for an armed person who terrorizes citizens and attacks military establishments?”
The violence began around 4 a.m., as hundreds of Islamists were observing dawn prayers at a vigil for Morsi outside the presidential guard facility where he was believed to be detained. What set off the violence could not be determined.
One neighbor cited by the Associated Press said in an account posted online that she had run to a window when she heard gunfire and had seen men shooting at security forces from a mosque roof. 
But that neighbor, identified as Mirna al-Hikbawy, wrote that she had not seen the start of the fighting.
Others, including supporters and opponents of Morsi, said the military and police had fired with little or no provocation, unloading tear gas, birdshot and bullets.
“They opened fire on us while we were praying,” Moataz Abu al-Shakra, a 25-year-old electrical engineer, said.
Many witnesses said the fighting lasted for hours, with hundreds of heavily armed soldiers chasing mostly unarmed protesters through the streets for blocks while continuing to shoot.
At the Nasr City hospital, a few minutes’ drive from initial shooting, Dr. Bassem al-Sayed, a surgeon, said he had seen a similar scene only once before, around Jan. 25, 2011, when Egyptians began their revolt against Mubarak.

In his first column, published Wednesday, Carson outlined much of the viewpoint that gained him attention in the political realm after speeches earlier this year -- criticizing political correctness and defending his position against same-sex marriage. ""For a long time, I thought that retirement would mean learning to play golf well, learning to play the organ and learning a variety of new languages,"" Carson wrote. ""I cannot now embark upon a life of leisure and watch my beloved nation and fellow citizens suffer from many self-inflicted wounds."" The move comes after months of speculation over Carson's political future. He was vaulted to the forefront of conservative politics after giving a speech in February criticizing many of President Barack Obama's health reform policies -- with the president seated feet away. He later stoked controversy over comments on same-sex marriage. While Carson has said he has no plans to run for political office, he said he would consider it if he felt God's calling. Carson retired earlier this month from his post as Hopkins' director of pediatric neurosurgery, a role he held for nearly three decades. While at Hopkins, he became the youngest person to lead a major division and was the first surgeon anywhere to separate twins conjoined at the head. Times CEO Larry Beasley called Carson ""one of the freshest and most powerful voices in the conservative movement"" in an article announcing the new column Wednesday. In his first column, Carson criticized what he called the ""PC police"" who pounced on comments he made about gay marriage during an appearance on Fox News. In an interview with Sean Hannity on the television network, he said gays and lesbians should not be able to change the definition of marriage, and neither should those who practice bestiality or pedophilia. ""The PC police tried to persuade people that I was comparing same-sex behavior with unacceptable forms of sexual variation. I was not making that comparison, but the speech minders insisted that it was my intention, as though they knew more about my intentions than I did,"" Carson wrote in the column. ""Their desire was to change the focus of the argument and to shut me up."" Those who criticized Carson for the comments included his former boss, Johns Hopkins Medicine Dean Dr. Paul B. Rothman, who called the statements ""hurtful"" and ""in conflict with our core values of diversity, inclusion and respect."" Carson stepped down as commencement speaker for Hopkins School of Medicine and School of Education after the controversy over his comments. Hopkins officials could not be immediately reached for comment. sdance@baltsun.com twitter.com/ssdance ___ (c)2013 The Baltimore Sun Visit The Baltimore Sun at www.baltimoresun.com Distributed by MCT Information Services Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(This studio image was lit using Wall's Morphalite® PRO-Flip flashlight.)  The  Morphalite® PRO-Flip and PRO-Scout flashlights.  Have brothers Frank and Gary Wall affirmed a quote famously attributed to American writer-philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door”?
In the expanding universe that is flashlight invention or, more accurately, flashlight improvement, perhaps they have.
And it all started with an accidental discovery in 1991 – “As most useful things are,” said Frank, a Vacaville resident who works as a senior engineer in product development for a San Jose-based maker of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), or semiconductor light sources.
Later, once flashlight bulb technology improved, followed by years of tinkering in Frank’s garage, they eventually produced flashlights that cast wide, bright swaths of light, horizontally or vertically, depending on how the flashlights are held, so the user can avoid tripping or slipping or be enabled to see people or objects in a nearly 180-degree field of vision in the dark. Patents are pending, he noted. 


In an interview at his Waterford Drive home, where the flashlights are assembled from parts made in Asia, Frank said “production-worthy” prototypes of the Morphalite Professional, fashioned of hard black metal and plastic and a slim 6 inches long, emerged in 2011. The head is about 2 inches in diameter, and the flashlights come with a combined push-button on-off and mode-changing (high, low, medium, strobe and S.O.S.) switch, and a glass-breaking edge around the head. Capable of easily fitting into a purse or pocket, it is powered by a rechargeable lithium/polymer battery.
One year later and after “five generations” of changes, he said, the newly configured and named Pro-Flip, rolled off their assembly line, or, rather, work benches, in hard plastic blister packs. Geared for the military and public safety officers, it gets its name from an attached, flip-down head containing small light-refracting clear acrylic lens, enabling the light beam to expand, the heart of the Walls’ innovation. When the head is flipped open, the flashlight – at one-half car-headlight brightness of 500 lumens – emits a standard circular beam of light.
The Walls created another model, the Morphalite Scout Tactical Flashlight, similar at about 5 inches long, without a flip-down head, which emits, at maximum power, 200 lumens. It uses three AAA batteries and is marketed to – and designed for – search-and-rescue officers, hikers, campers, and bicyclists. Printed instructions warn that the flashlight projects a bright beam of light. “DO NOT look at, or shine into other people’s eyes,” it reads.
Frank and Gary, a Citrus Heights resident and a customer-service specialist at Lowe’s in Vacaville, conducted field trials of the Morphalite Professional. They loaned some models to fire fighters, police officers and others. They even sent some to U.S. military forces in Afghanistan.
“The people who took them love them,” said Gary, 58, an “Army brat” raised on U.S. and German military posts. “They used them and showed them to everybody.” 


Included with each flashlight, packaging notes tout their products’ attributes: “Really see where you are going. Blaze a path of light from the tip of your toes &amp; up. See what you’ve been missing!”
A visitor to his home, Morphalites in hand, conceded that any user of a traditional flashlight would have to concede the claims are valid.
Frank said inventors “for years” had struggled to create a flashlight that emitted a wide beam. He stumbled across the improvement by accident, when he passed light through a clear, acrylic rod, refracting it.
In the early 1990s, he recalled, the prevailing belief of flashlight bulb technology was, if a flashlight emitted 30 lumens or more it was considered “really bright,” he said. Such luminosity was still not powerful enough to make a difference, said Frank, a Michigan native.
“Therefore, I boxed up all my experiments until a better technology came along,” he said in a written note to The Reporter.
 LEDs, he noted, had been a hobby since 1982.
“I have made a career of microelectronics packaging, so packaging LEDs came to be a natural extension of my skill set” when he began working in San Jose in 2002, he said.
The idea for the Walls’ two reconfigured flashlights came in 2007, when Frank and his wife, Amy, were at a Vacaville Starbucks coffee shop. He spotted some police officers on break and asked them what they needed in flashlights.
“A Vacaville sergeant stated that they were interested in having more light over a broader area for flashlights,” he recollected. “We thanked them and left. I wasn’t two blocks away, when I pulled the car over to the curb; we both looked at each other with a wicked grin, and I shouted, ‘I’ve already done this!’ ” As soon as he returned home, Frank unboxed his old prototypes, dusted them off, and began experimenting with the latest LED flashlights.

“We’re opening up opportunities for people to see light that they’ve never seen before,” said Gary. “I don’t know why it (the flashlights) hasn’t been made into a product before.” Have brothers Frank and Gary Wall affirmed a quote famously attributed to American writer-philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door”? In the expanding universe that is flashlight invention or, more accurately, flashlight improvement, perhaps they have. And it all started with an accidental discovery in 1991 – “As most useful things are,” said Frank, a Vacaville resident who works as a senior engineer in product development for a San Jose-based maker of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), or semiconductor light sources. Later, once flashlight bulb technology improved, followed by years of tinkering in Frank’s garage, they eventually produced flashlights that cast wide, bright swaths of light, horizontally or vertically, depending on how the flashlights are held, so the user can avoid tripping or slipping or be enabled to see people or objects in a nearly 180-degree field of vision in the dark. Patents are pending, he noted. In an interview at his Waterford Drive home, where the flashlights are assembled from parts made in Asia, Frank said “production-worthy” prototypes of the Morphalite Professional, fashioned of hard black metal and plastic and a slim 6 inches long, emerged in 2011. The head is about 2 inches in diameter, and the flashlights come with a combined push-button on-off and mode-changing (high, low, medium, strobe and S.O.S.) switch, and a glass-breaking edge around the head. Capable of easily fitting into a purse or pocket, it is powered by a rechargeable lithium/polymer battery. One year later and after “five generations” of changes, he said, the newly configured and named Pro-Flip, rolled off their assembly line, or, rather, work benches, in hard plastic blister packs. Geared for the military and public safety officers, it gets its name from an attached, flip-down head containing small light-refracting clear acrylic lens, enabling the light beam to expand, the heart of the Walls’ innovation. When the head is flipped open, the flashlight – at one-half car-headlight brightness of 500 lumens – emits a standard circular beam of light. The Walls created another model, the Morphalite Scout Tactical Flashlight, similar at about 5 inches long, without a flip-down head, which emits, at maximum power, 200 lumens. It uses three AAA batteries and is marketed to – and designed for – search-and-rescue officers, hikers, campers, and bicyclists. Printed instructions warn that the flashlight projects a bright beam of light. “DO NOT look at, or shine into other people’s eyes,” it reads. Frank and Gary, a Citrus Heights resident and a customer-service specialist at Lowe’s in Vacaville, conducted field trials of the Morphalite Professional. They loaned some models to fire fighters, police officers and others. They even sent some to U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. “The people who took them love them,” said Gary, 58, an “Army brat” raised on U.S. and German military posts. “They used them and showed them to everybody.” Included with each flashlight, packaging notes tout their products’ attributes: “Really see where you are going. Blaze a path of light from the tip of your toes &amp; up. See what you’ve been missing!” A visitor to his home, Morphalites in hand, conceded that any user of a traditional flashlight would have to concede the claims are valid. Frank said inventors “for years” had struggled to create a flashlight that emitted a wide beam. He stumbled across the improvement by accident, when he passed light through a clear, acrylic rod, refracting it. In the early 1990s, he recalled, the prevailing belief of flashlight bulb technology was, if a flashlight emitted 30 lumens or more it was considered “really bright,” he said. Such luminosity was still not powerful enough to make a difference, said Frank, a Michigan native. “Therefore, I boxed up all my experiments until a better technology came along,” he said in a written note to The Reporter. LEDs, he noted, had been a hobby since 1982. “I have made a career of microelectronics packaging, so packaging LEDs came to be a natural extension of my skill set” when he began working in San Jose in 2002, he said. The idea for the Walls’ two reconfigured flashlights came in 2007, when Frank and his wife, Amy, were at a Vacaville Starbucks coffee shop. He spotted some police officers on break and asked them what they needed in flashlights. “A Vacaville sergeant stated that they were interested in having more light over a broader area for flashlights,” he recollected. “We thanked them and left. I wasn’t two blocks away, when I pulled the car over to the curb; we both looked at each other with a wicked grin, and I shouted, ‘I’ve already done this!’ ” As soon as he returned home, Frank unboxed his old prototypes, dusted them off, and began experimenting with the latest LED flashlights.

144732270,2013-08-05 13:39:03,Valarie Kaur: Why We Must Remember Oak Creek,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valarie-kaur/sikh-shooting-oak-creek_b_3706970.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Interfaith Leader, Lawyer, Filmmaker One year ago this morning, a lone gunman walked into a house of worship and stalked the prayer hall, communal kitchen and living rooms. Wherever he saw people, he lifted his gun without expression and fired. He killed six people and critically wounded others, including a police officer. The August 5, 2012 mass shooting in Oak Creek, Wisconsin received national attention for a few days, but then faded into the background as one in a list of mass shootings last year. One year later, people I meet know Aurora and Newtown but draw a blank when I use the shorthand ""Oak Creek."" If the gunman were seen as Muslim, and the victims Christians, gathered in a Sunday church service, we may still be talking about Oak Creek today. But the gunman was a white supremacist. And the victims were Sikh Americans whose men wear turbans as part of their faith.  Today, on the one-year anniversary, we must remember Oak Creek as the largest act of violence on a faith community since the 1963 church bombings. We must remember the Sikh community's response to the shooting because it offers a model for how one small community can rise from the ashes of tragedy to bring people together in forgiveness and healing - and even effect policy change. But most of all, we must remember the story of Oak Creek because it could happen again. In the immediate aftermath of the Oak Creek tragedy, the Sikh community entered the national spotlight for the first time. In the midst of grief, the community found the courage to explain their faith, respond with forgiveness, and call for healing. Sikh youth of Oak Creek stepped before news cameras to call for an end to hate - not just against Sikhs but against all people. The families cleaned the gurdwara themselves, turning a site of massacre back into a house of worship, and gathered to pray for the departed, including the gunman. ""Last year, we prayed for the soul of Wade Michael Page,"" said Raghuvinder Singh, whose father Punjab Singh remains hospitalized one year after the shooting, unable to move or speak except to blink his eyes. ""Our faith teaches us compassion for every person. We continue to pray that his soul goes in peace."" In the last year, many Sikh Americans have extended the ethic of compassion into seva or sacred service. In Oak Creek, Sikhs have formed new organizations including Serve2Unite and Sikh Healing Collective. Pardeep Kaleka, whose father was killed fighting the gunman, has teamed up with Arno Michaelis, a former white supremacist, speaking to young people about combatting hate. Another victim's son, Harpreet Saini, whose mother was killed in the shooting, became the first Sikh in U.S. history to testify before Congress in a historic Senate hearing last September. He asked the government to give his mother the dignity of at least being counted as a hate crime statistic, to measure the problem so that we can begin to address it. The Sikh Coalition, joined by civil rights and faith-based organizations, including Groundswell at Auburn Seminary, led a campaign calling for the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs and other communities - and won. ""We've made progress in the last year,"" said Amardeep Singh Bhalla of the Sikh Coalition. ""But one year later, the underlying conditions that allowed Oak Creek to happen are still in play."" Hate groups in America are on an alarming rise by almost 70 percent since 2000, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. In the last year, Sikhs have continued to endure discrimination, bullying, vandalism, racial profiling, and gun violence. In Fresno, California, an 81-year-old Sikh man, Piara Singh, was badly beaten with steel pipe while walking home from temple. In a Florida attack, Kanwaljit Singh sustained multiple gunshot wounds from an unidentified shooter while driving with his 13-year-old son. In Washington, a turban-wearing Sikh cab driver was brutally attacked and beaten by a man screaming anti-Muslim and racial slurs. Just days ago, the walls of a Sikh house of worship in Sacramento were defaced by graffiti spelling out ""terrorist."" Oak Creek is not an isolated incident. Yet, remarkably, rather than retreating into itself or thickening its walls against a future attack, Sikh gurdwaras in Wisconsin and across the country have opened up to the broader community in the last year. In Oak Creek this weekend, thousands of people of all faiths and backgrounds attended the anniversary events - a federal observance on Friday, a memorial run on Saturday, prayer services on Sunday, and a candlelight vigil on Monday. The gurdwara has been bustling with Sikhs from Milwaukee and around the country, a wide array of Wisconsin residents, police officers, government officials, and survivors of other mass shootings. This openness embodies a sense that all people can share in the Sikh spirit of Chardi Kala--everlasting optimism and ever-rising high spirits, even in the face of suffering. ""I'm proud to represent Oak Creek,"" said Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi at the federal observance. ""Not as a scene of violence, but as a symbol of what one small community can do."" Today, the gurdwara shows no sign of the massacre that took place there one year ago - except for a single bullet hole in the entrance to the prayer hall. The plaque below it reads ""We are One."" The Oak Creek tragedy calls us to fulfill that promise, but first, we must choose to remember it. Remember Oak Creek. Watch the Film.

Nidal Malik Hasan fired the last of 146 bullets in his assault on Fort Hood, then walked outside where he met two civilians who asked about the commotion and the laser-sighted pistol in his hand. Hasan told one person not to worry. He assured the other it was just a training exercise and the gun shot only paint. He let both live. But moments earlier, dozens of uniformed soldiers received no quarter from Hasan, prosecutors said Tuesday as the Army psychiatrist's long-delayed trial began in a Texas military courtroom. With his life hanging in the balance, Hasan made little effort to defend himself. Acting as his own attorney, he calmly told the jury that he killed 13 people and wounded 32 others in the 2009 attack. ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter,"" he said in an opening statement that lasted little more than a minute The evidence, he added, would ""only show one side."" His only utterance of regret was an acknowledgement that he was among ""imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion.""    






                    Brigitte Woosley, Associated Press - Ap
                

                                            This court room sketch shows Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan during his court-martial Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2013, in Forth Hood, Texas. ""I apologize for any mistakes I made in this endeavor,"" said Hasan, an American-born 42-year-old who was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the attack. He spoke from a wheelchair, wearing green Army fatigues and a gray, bushy beard. Hasan planned the assault for months, prosecutor Col. Steve Henricks said, describing how the defendant stockpiled bullets, practiced at a shooting range and bought an extender kit so his pistol could hold more bullets. If convicted, Hasan could get the death penalty. No American soldier has been executed since 1961, and military prosecutors showed that they would take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction. They described a calculating Hasan, armed with two handguns and carrying paper towels in his pants pockets to conceal the sounds of rattling ammunition as he walked through a deployment-readiness center on the sprawling base. ""He came to believe he had a jihad duty to murder his fellow soldiers,"" Henricks said, adding that Hasan had researched Taliban leaders' call to wage holy war. The government has also said Hasan sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. The shooting happened about three weeks after Hasan learned he would be deploying to Afghanistan. Upon getting the orders that he was going overseas, Hasan told a base doctor that, ""They've got another thing coming if they think they are going to deploy me,"" Henricks said. On the day of the attack, Hasan sat among his fellow soldiers who were preparing to go overseas. He tried to clear the area of civilians, even walking over to a civilian data clerk to tell her she was needed elsewhere in the building because a supervisor was looking for her. The prosecutor said the clerk thought that was odd but went anyway. ""He then yelled 'Allahu akbar!' and opened fire on unarmed, unsuspecting and defenseless soldiers,"" Henricks told the jury of 13 officers. During Tuesday's proceedings, Hasan mostly looked down or straight ahead, occasionally leafing through paperwork while seated at the defense table. He spoke politely from his wheelchair, talking so softly at times that families of victims leaned forward to hear him. Hasan declined to cross-examine any of the witnesses he shot or those who recounted his firearm purchases at a store called Guns Galore in nearby Killeen. But he didn't pass on a chance to cross-examine his former supervisor, who had given Hasan high marks on an evaluation the very week of what Hasan would only call ""the incident."" Mumbling and stumbling over his questions — at one point mispronouncing his own name — Hasan asked retired Lt. Col. Ben Phillips a series of questions about ""medical personnel initiating mercy killings."" He also appeared to ask about a water supply in Iraq being contaminated with gas. One soldier who was repeatedly shot testified that he played dead before realizing the gunman might notice he was sweating. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford was hit seven times — twice inside the building when he played dead, then five more times outside. He said he decided to flee because ""dead men don't sweat."" Soldiers were trying to push their way out of a double-door exit, he said. But one door was locked, so it created a bottleneck.    






                    .
                

                                            Maj. Nidal Hasan Hasan wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder, but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death-penalty cases. In writings and in previous court statements, he sought to argue that he carried out the shooting to defend the Taliban from American attacks. But the judge denied that request. The trial is playing out amid high security at Fort Hood, where armed guards stood in doorways and 15-foot stacks of shock-absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse. Jurors were told the trial could take months. Hasan needs regular breaks because of his paralysis. Numerous requests have delayed the trial for years, including arguments over Hasan's beard, which he insisted on growing despite the fact that it violates military regulations. Hasan dismissed his attorneys earlier this year. Over the next several weeks, he could question many more witnesses who were among the wounded, plus dozens of others who were inside the post's Soldier Readiness Processing Center at the time of the attack. © 2021 StarTribune.

Online,http://www.eonline.com/,"Coverage of the Jodi Arias murder trial certainly ruffled plenty of feathers, some more than others. A 48-year-old man who claims he's in love with the now-convicted murderer is in custody and accused of threatening to ""slit the throats"" of HLN hosts Nancy Gracy and Jane-Velez Mitchell over what he thought was heavily negative coverage of Arias' case, according to authorities. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office confirms that David Lee Simpson was indicted in Phoenix on July 18 on two counts of stalking and three counts of computer tampering, all felony counts, and has been transferred from New York, where he was arrested, to Arizona. PHOTOS: Guilty Gallery Per a statement released by the Sheriff's Office, Simpson was ""apparently infatuated"" with Arias and, ""infuriated"" with what they were saying about her, allegedly tweeted several nasty posts about Grace and Mitchell after Arias' trial, which ended with her being convicted of first-degree murder in the death of her ex-boyfriend. ""Among his many tweets pertaining to the Arias trial were threats to strap the commentators to a ‘tree naked and leave them to suffer all night' and then ‘slit their throats.' Simpson also allegedly told a co-worker that he wanted to hang one of the TV commentators by her feet and ‘gut her like a deer,'"" the statement continued. The investigation into Simpson's activities began in June and, last week, police stopped him while he was driving south from Bath, N.Y., after quitting his job working the front desk of an auto-repair shop and allegedly telling his employer he was headed out of town. Police say that they found several guns, shotgun ammunition, handcuffs, zip-ties, binoculars, a knife, a police radio and a receipt for a recently purchased shotgun in his vehicle. Authorities also allegedly found newspaper clippings pertaining to the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn.; a shooting in Webster, N.Y., in which four fireman were fired upon while responding to a call; and an article printed from an Arizona news website about a woman arrested on charges of bestiality. PHOTOS: Celebrity mug shots ""Threats against anyone have to be taken seriously,"" Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said in a statement. ""Media personalities are frequent targets and because of their high visibility, they are particularly vulnerable. A few in the past have been stalked and murdered. ""This suspect was on his way south with enough weapons in his car to do serious harm to someone. Fortunately, we acted quickly and in so doing, were able to stop him before anything could transpire."" Simpson, who is said to not yet have an attorney, is also accused of threatening a local woman who defended Grace and Velez-Mitchell online. The probable-cause statement filed in Maricopa County reportedly stated that he started tweeting about Mitchell and Grace on the night of June 12, after prosecutor Bill Montgomery had announced that he would try again to secure the death penalty for Arias after a jury came back split. ""He provided a full confession and stated he posted everything on Twitter because he was in love with Jodi Arias and he wanted a life with her,"" the statement reportedly said.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: FORT HOOD, Texas—The Army psychiatrist charged in the 2009 Fort Hood mass shooting said in a statement to Fox News that the U.S. government is at war with Islam. It’s the first statement Maj. Nidal Hasan has put out to the U.S. media. In the past, he has spoken via telephone with Al-Jazeera, the transcript of which is evidence in his upcoming trial. “My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,” Hasan said in the lengthy statement released to Fox News ( http://fxn.ws/1cafkA2) on Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, “I participated in it.” Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted. The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and has made similar declarations during pre-trial hearings and jury selection. Fox News reported that Hasan didn’t directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long. Hasan also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army. “I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. … I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,” he told Fox News in the statement. Hasan also has objected to the judge’s denial of his “defense of others” strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents “an enemy of Islam.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

It is the first time the defense has admitted that Holmes killed 12 people in the mass shooting, The Denver Post reported. The judge in Holmes' murder trial last month accepted the defendant's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Suspect to wear hidden harness during trial Holmes previously offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars if authorities would spare his life, but prosecutors in Arapahoe County announced in April they would seek the death penalty. The defense then decided to make an insanity plea. Judge Carlos Samour Jr. has told attorneys he expects the trial to take place in 2014. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that Holmes was sane at the time of the shootings. Attorneys will use the results of a mental evaluation as evidence at the trial.

Almost every week a child is shot in St. Louis, often making the front page of the local paper. Gunshot victims are routinely admitted to the hospital right next door to my home. This is the neighborhood where I live. Emergency room doctors urge us to remove firearms from our homes while they work round the clock to save the lives of gun violence victims, some just babies. Police chiefs ask for our help to address their number one concern: keeping their officers from being shot. This is the city where I live. Parents, like me, send their children to school in Jonesboro, AR; Springfield, OR; Littleton, CO; Lancaster, PA; (Virginia Tech) Blacksburg, VA; (Northern Illinois U) in DeKalb, IL; and Newton, CT and expect them to come home safely without being shot. Some, however, have not. These are communities, similar to mine, where I live. Gun violence is real in Missouri, whether it's domestic violence, drive by shootings, careless accidents or suicide. Almost everyone I know can name a friend or relative who has been killed by a firearm. This is the state where I live. In Florida a teenage boy while walking home, was stalked, shot and killed by a neighborhood vigilante who has now gone free. 54 people were shot in Chicago alone during the trial of that shooter, George Zimmerman. On average, 28 people have been shot to death each day since the Sandy Hook school shooting last December with a total of 14 mass shootings. Each year 100 preschoolers are shot, some even by other children. This is the country where I live. In Jefferson City, Missouri, the majority of my elected colleagues are beholden to the gun manufacturer's lobby and vote to pass their bills. The majority of my state legislators voted to nullify federal gun laws, make it a crime for federal law enforcement to do their jobs and to arm teachers (over the objection of superintendents statewide). Missouri House Speaker Tim Jones and Majority Floor Leader John Diehl, both St. Louis attorneys, supported and promoted this agenda all the way to the governor's desk. This is the state Capitol where I serve. Recently I was asked on a radio show in St. Louis if I was against gun companies making a profit. Profit by companies turning their back while citizens, and our children, continue to be killed? That's a no brainer to me. Car, pharmaceutical and toy companies have all immediately withdrawn or altered their products in the name of safety when just a handful have died. Profit is one thing. Responsibility as funerals multiply is another. I believe there are solutions as do many of us. This past spring I was part of the White House Initiative on Preventing Gun Violence, working with law enforcement, medical community, elected officials, school administrators, anyone connected to the firearm industry and survivors from all over the country. Ideas were narrowed to a concrete plan titled ""Now is the Time"". I sponsored the universal background checks for firearm sales in our state legislature as did fellow legislators in other states. Similar to the bi-partisan Toomey/Manchin U.S. Senate bill produced by the White House initiative, Missouri HB187 would require all sales, including those on the internet and at gun shows, to undergo federal background checks. Already 60% of gun sales are subject to federal checks but the 40% which are exempt is disturbing. An overwhelming 85% of Missourians, including gun owners and N.R.A. members support background checks on all firearm sales, as do 90% of Americans. In 1999 after the Columbine High School mass shooting, the N.R.A. favored extending background checks but has since changed their tune when manufacturers realized their profit margin would decrease. What happened in Missouri with the background check bill this past session? Absolutely nothing. My bill was not even granted a hearing. Instead of silence from the gun manufacturer's lobby after the next mass shooting, what if there was a sincere effort for collective responsibility? What if one firearm company expressed concern and locked hands with citizens to do everything possible to avoid additional gun deaths? Imagine a manufacturer stepping forward and turning the conversation. One company could insist on built in childproof trigger locks and agree to limit for purchase the number of high capacity ammunition magazines for the sake of safety. One company might join with the huge number of N.R.A. members (unlike the N.R.A. leadership) who advocate similar safe guards. It would only take one corporation to join with state and federal officers to keep criminals and those with mental illness from legally purchasing them. Just one manufacturer could commit to ending gun trafficking that plagues our cities and assist law enforcement in tracing stolen and illegal guns. One company might spark another's actions. Just as we've seen in other disasters, responsible actions by corporations without emphasis on profit margins earn the public's trust and admiration. This is the place where I'd like to live. There are concrete solutions to saving lives if every one of us steps up, including the business community. Imagine a safe environment for teachers, first responders, law enforcement and all children, regardless of their zip code. Imagine a political climate with donors who refuse to reward elected officials who do not value our safety. Imagine on Election Day, those who stand up for saving lives are the ones elected to lead with sensible legislation we all demand. Envision a safe peaceful community for everyone. That is a place where we all should live. Just imagine... I am a Missouri State Representative focused on gun violence prevention, women's reproductive justice and voting rights.

138390670,2013-07-16 11:30:20,"Newtown School Police Officers Detail Horrific Day, 7 Months After Massacre",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/newtown-school-police_n_3601282.html?utm_hp_ref=politics,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Education Reporter, The Huffington Post ORLANDO, Fla. -- It happened seven months ago Sunday, but remembering details of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting still brings tears to the eyes of Lenny Penna. ""I'm hoping that, you know, it's been seven months, emotions won't set in,"" Penna said. ""But it is what it is."" Penna, a member of the police department in Newtown, Conn., and his colleague Jason Flynn, spoke to an audience of about 800 school resource officers at the National Association for School Resource Officers conference Monday. School resource officers are police specifically trained for working as law enforcement agents and educators in schools. Before the Sandy Hook massacre, Newtown had two -- Flynn and Penna. Their stories outlined the events of the day in great detail, from start to finish. They also touched on how school-based police officers can be marginalized from the rest of the force. They spoke a week after reports surfaced that the Newtown police response to the massacre is under investigation by the Connecticut State Police. They did not mention the shooter's name once. ""This individual woke up at his home, took a rifle that was inside the home and killed his mother who was sleeping in her bed,"" Penna said. ""He had taken her car and loaded up multiple weapons and drove to the school."" Flynn and Penna then played the 10-minute audio clip of the police dispatch from 9:36 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2012, before the audience of school personnel. ""Caller's indicating she thinks someone's shooting in the building,"" the staticky clip starts. Throughout, the two Newtown officers stood in silence, bowing their heads, biting their lips. On Dec. 14, Penna was stationed in Newtown's middle school, where he usually works. As soon as he got the call, he drove in his unmarked car to Sandy Hook. He assumed there were at least two shooters. When he arrived in the parking lot, the first thing he saw was a black car with two black jackets on the ground besides it. He assumed it was the two shooters. ""When I saw it, the passenger door was open,"" he said. ""You could tell, it was out of place."" He pulled up with his team to open a door, which led to the boiler room. Penna was with the lieutenant and a sergeant, and since Penna had the rifle, they had him enter first. He didn't know whether he would make it out. ""We heard there was a shooting, but I didn't think it was a school shooting, where kids were being killed,"" he said. ""You don't think like that."" He was suddenly hit with a strong waft of the odor of gun powder, and reached the main vestibule. He saw two lifeless bodies and ""the biggest pool of blood that I've ever seen,"" he said. For a split-second, he thought it was a mock scene, a training drill, because it was ""so real it didn't seem real."" He then entered the second classroom that had been hit. First, he saw a ""live, first-grade girl covered in blood."" She told him, ""I'm scared and I wanna go home."" Behind her, everyone in the classroom was dead. Penna's mind flashed to his daughters, one of whom was the same age as the living girl. He had her stay in the classroom to keep her from harm's way. He then entered into the first classroom and heard a shot. ""My first thought was one of our guys shot him,"" he said. So he ran back, grabbed the girl, and took her out -- before learning that the shooter had shot himself. Penna returned to the suspicious car and found a shotgun in the back seat. He threw it in the trunk and locked it. He noticed bullet holes on other cars. Flynn, assigned to Newtown's public high school, had started his day discussing a sexual assault case with the assistant principal and interviewing students. When he first got the call, he tried phoning Penna, but he didn't answer. No one picked up in the police department. Maybe the phone is broken, he thought. At one point, Flynn ran into Penna, who had already been inside the elementary school. Penna looked at him and said, ""It's not good."" A lieutenant told Flynn, ""I think it's a high school student."" Flynn's heart stopped. ""Someone says one of your students just killed 26 people,"" he said. ""That's a heavy burden. How can that be?"" Flynn went in to try to identify the person. He didn't recognize the shooter, because he wasn't a student. ""Unfortunately, it's a face I'll never forget,"" he said. ""It's etched in my mind, unfortunately."" After the shooting, Flynn and Penna were tasked with drawing up the ""list of unaccounted"" people, creating folders for each missing person. When Penna turned on his computer to start the job, he opened the MSN homepage and saw the headline, ""Newtown Shooting, 18 Dead."" That's when it hit him. ""I can't believe that this happened,"" he said he thought. The officers organized parents in the firehouse and reunited the remaining families. The killings, Penna and Flynn said, made the Newtown Police Department respect school resource officers. Before that, they felt isolated, because they usually worked out of the schools, and not the police headquarters ""We're viewed as not essential,"" Flynn said. He said they were regularly tasked with things like bringing a car down the highway. ""We come in, we go to the schools, it's like nobody ever saw us,"" he said. After the shooting, Penna said, Newtown added police to their schools. Penna and Flynn started work earlier to better correspond with the schools' hours. They saw a therapist to help them heal. ""We're guys, we're cops, we don't like to talk about our feelings,"" Flynn said. ""It's real important that you go get help."" A colleague of theirs broke down one day because of what he'd seen. Newtown wants to expand its school resource officers, but doesn't have enough manpower to put one in each school. ""It's very political,"" Penna said. ""It's costly, they have to work out all the financial issues."" Senior Education Reporter, The Huffington Post Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, November 6, 2009




Fort Hood, the Texas military base that was the scene of a mass shooting Thursday, has been hard hit by the growing strain on the Army from multiple combat deployments -- with its personnel suffering the highest number of suicides among Army installations since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to official data.


After many years of lengthy war zone rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army personnel are experiencing record rates of suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other mental health problems, as well as worsening alcohol and drug abuse.


The psychological toll on the all-volunteer force today is unprecedented, Army officials say, acknowledging that they do not know how much the Army can sustain before it breaks -- making the health of the force a major consideration in President Obama's current deliberations over sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan.


It's unclear what motivated the Army psychiatrist who is thought to have opened fire on fellow soldiers Thursday, although it's clear he had worked in settings where the effects of combat stress were pervasive.


A small but increasing number of soldiers undergoing the mental strain of repeated combat deployments are taking lives -- often their own.


This year, 117 active-duty Army soldiers were reported to have committed suicide, with 81 of those cases confirmed -- up from 103 suicides during the same period last year. Ten suicides have been reported at Fort Hood this year; more than 75 of its personnel have committed suicide since 2003. Fort Hood's high number of suicides is also linked to the fact that it is the Army's largest base, with more than 53,000 soldiers.


An estimated 30 percent of those returning from combat suffer mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Such problems grow worse with repeated deployments and the constant exposure to danger and the sights, smells and emotions of seeing others killed or wounded, according to Army mental health surveys.


Those who treat the mentally wounded, including doctors such as Hasan, are not immune from the symptoms. It is not uncommon for therapists who treat patients for post-traumatic stress disorder to experience some symptoms vicariously after hearing account after account of the horrors of the battlefield.


Hasan was a psychiatry intern at Walter Reed Army Medical Center from June 2003 to July 2009, Army officials said. In that position, he probably treated soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder.


Violent outbursts such as shootings by soldiers at Army bases have occurred in recent years, including at Fort Hood, where several killings were reported over the past two years.


Historically, one of the worst shooting incidents involving soldiers took place Oct. 27, 1995, at Towle Stadium at Fort Bragg, N.C., when a soldier opened fire on paratroopers in a formation, killing one Army officer and wounding 18 others.

(AP) — A community foundation tasked with dividing up donations received after the Connecticut school shootings made preliminary recommendations on $7.7 million that call for giving $281,000 to each of the families of the 26 children and school educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. The families of 12 surviving children who witnessed the Dec. 14 shootings would each get $20,000; two teachers who were injured would get $150,000 between them. The foundation was asked to divide up $11.4 million that was raised with the help of the United Way. The foundation previously decided to divvy up $7.7 million to the families and survivors and to have committees decide on uses for the remainder of the donations, including whether to use some of it for future mental health care and other needs. The recommendations were released before a public forum Thursday at Newtown's Edmond Town Hall to discuss how to divide the $7.7 million. Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros, special advisers to a distribution committee appointed by the Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation, made the recommendations. ""Is the money adequate? Of course not,"" Feinberg said. ""No amount is adequate to deal with these horrors. Money is a pretty poor substitute but that's what we have. Solomon himself could not distribute this money in a fashion that would please everybody."" The committee met privately before the meeting with some family members. A handful of people commented at the meeting, attended by dozens. Some questioned the process for arriving at the $7.7 million for the families. ""Why isn't all the money going to all the victims? The intent was to give the money to the victims. We're starting from a false premise and this process is re-victimizing the victims,"" said Caryn Kaufman, who represents a coalition of prior mass shooting victims. Jeffrey Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, praised the recommendation to provide money to the 12 children who survived the shootings because he said it recognizes the lasting trauma survivors suffer. Some victims' families have complained the process has caused them anguish by putting them in the difficult place of deciding how to divide the money. The $7.7 million is expected to be paid out next month."
145126935,2013-08-06 00:00:00,"Maj. Hasan: Evidence Will Show ""I Am the Shooter""",http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/08/06/maj_hasan_evidence_will_show_i_am_the_shooter_119517.html,en,True,,1040,RealClearPolitics,http://realclearpolitics.com/,"By Nomaan Merchant and Peter Weber - August 6, 2013  FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) -- The Army psychiatrist accused in the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military installation told jurors Tuesday that evidence would ""clearly show"" he was the gunman during the attack on Fort Hood, but he insisted it wouldn't tell the whole story. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan briefly laid out his defense as he addressed jurors during the first day of the long-delayed trial for the attack that killed 13 people on the Texas Army post in 2009. Acting as his own attorney, Hasan also cited his religion but didn't elaborate. ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter,"" he said, adding later that it also would show ""that we are imperfect Muslims trying to establish the perfect religion... I apologize for any mistakes I made in this endeavor."" Prosecutors also laid out their argument, telling jurors that Hasan deliberately targeted fellow soldiers and meticulously planned to ""kill as many soldiers as he could."" Col. Steve Henricks told jurors that Hasan tried to clear the area of civilians as he walked through and opened fire inside a building where service members were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in 2009. Henricks described how Hasan entered the building as a civilian data cleric stood at entrance station and told her she was needed elsewhere in the building because a supervisor looking for her. The prosecutor said the cleric thought that was odd but went anyway. ""He then yelled 'Allahu akbar!' and opened fire on unarmed, unsuspecting and defenseless soldiers,"" Henricks told the jury, noting that one of the soldiers who was killed ran after Hasan armed with nothing but a chair. When Hasan left the building, a civilian approached him and asked what was going on. Hasan told him not to worry about it, and the civilian ""walks away from the encounter unscathed,"" the prosecutor said. Hasan allegedly told another civilian that there was a training exercise going on and he was carrying a paintball gun. Hasan only shot at one civilian who tried to stop him, Henricks said. Henricks also said Hasan picked the date of the attack - Nov. 5, 2009 - for a specific reason, though he didn't immediately reveal details. Hasan is charged with numerous counts of murder and attempted murder for the attack that left 13 people dead. He had wanted to argue that he carried out the shooting in ""defense of others,"" namely members of the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan, but the judge denied that strategy. His defense strategy still remains unclear, but over the next several weeks, he is expected to question witnesses and possibly present his own evidence. The trial seems likely to unfold as a faceoff between the gunman and his victims. On the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded, plus dozens of others who were inside the post's Soldier Readiness Processing Center. They've also said they saw Hasan shout ""Allahu akbar!"" - Arabic for ""God is great!"" - and opened fire on unarmed fellow soldiers. The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Hasan has never denied carrying out the attack, and the facts of the case are mostly settled. But questions abound about how the trial will play out. How will Hasan question his victims? How will victims respond? How will his health hold up? The defendant, who was shot in the back by officers responding to the attack, is now paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. He requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours, and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was wounded, is expected to testify. He said he looked forward to seeing Hasan, in a way. ""I'm not going to dread anything. That's a sign of fear,"" Lunsford said. ""That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again."" But Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning said he dreaded the expected confrontation. ""I have to keep my composure and not go after the guy,"" said Manning, a mental health specialist who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan with Hasan. ""I'm not afraid of him, obviously. He's a paralyzed guy in a wheelchair, but it's sickening that he's still living and breathing."" The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told jurors to prepare for a trial that could last several months. On Tuesday, guards stood watch with long assault rifles outside the courthouse. A long row of shipping freight containers, stacked three high, created a fence around the building, which was almost entirely hidden by 15-foot-tall stacks of heavy, shock-absorbing barriers that extend to the roofline. John Galligan, Hasan's former lead attorney, said Monday that he still keeps in touch with Hasan but wasn't sure what he would say Tuesday, if anything. Hasan has indicated recently that he still wants his views to be heard. He has released statements to media outlets about his views on the Islamic legal code known as Sharia and how it conflicts with American democracy. If he is convicted and sentenced to death, it will most likely be decades before he makes it to the death chamber, if at all. The military has not executed an active-duty soldier since 1961. Five men are on the military death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., but none is close to an execution date. --- AP National Writer Allen G.

A new gun law in Kansas went into effect on July 1, allowing state school districts to determine if employees can carry concealed weapons on campus. However, a major insurance company is now saying it will not cover schools that allow concealed carrying for district employees, according to The New York Times. Des Moines-based firm EMC Insurance, which currently covers up to 90 percent of Kansas school districts, says it made the decision based on finances, according to the Des Moines Register. The policy has inserted EMC into the middle of the national debate on gun control. “We’ve been writing school business for almost 40 years, and one of the underwriting guidelines we follow for schools is that any on-site armed security should be provided by uniformed, qualified law enforcement officers,” said Mick Lovell, a vice president at EMC, according to the Des Moines Register. “Our guidelines have not recently changed.” Other insurance companies that cover the state’s remaining districts have also said they will not cover schools that arm staff members. Kansas lawmakers passed the concealed carry bill in April, several months after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., prompted some schools to re-evaluate the merits of weapons for self-defense. None of Kansas' K-12 districts have currently decided to arm staff members, although several institutions of higher education have, reports The Times. These institutions, while previously covered by EMC, have been able to find new insurers. In addition to Kansas, several other states recently decided to expand the availability of guns on school grounds. Several other states -- Alabama and South Dakota among them -- passed similar measures this past year. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: LILLINGTON, N.C. — Alonzo Lunsford is blind in his left eye. Half his intestines have been surgically removed. He has trouble walking. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.
A powerfully built man who stands 6-foot-9, Lunsford was shot seven times at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009, in the worst mass shooting on a U.S. military base. Now he’s steeling himself for the day when he will come face-to-face in military court with the man accused of shooting him, Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan.
Lunsford, 46, stared down Hasan in a confrontation inside a Fort Hood courtroom in 2010. He was the first victim to testify at a preliminary hearing for the Army psychiatrist charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder.
Now, with opening statements in Hasan’s court martial set to begin Tuesday, Lunsford faces the even more formidable prospect of responding to his attacker directly: Hasan, who is acting as his own attorney, could elect to cross-examine his alleged victim himself.
Hasan faces the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. He has said he was justified in killing U.S. soldiers about to deploy to Afghanistan in order to prevent the imminent deaths of Taliban fighters, but the judge has forbidden him to use that defense in court.
“I have a lot of anger,” Lunsford said in the four-bedroom home in rural North Carolina that was donated to him by a veterans support group. “It was seven times this man tried to kill me. I took that personally.”
Lunsford is convinced Hasan will try to bait him, hoping he’ll lose his temper and undermine his testimony. Because Hasan is a psychiatrist familiar with PTSD, Lunsford said, he knows that people with the disorder have difficulty controlling their emotions.
“He knows how to push those buttons,” Lunsford said. “The toughest part is trying to control my anger.”
At the preliminary hearing, Lunsford made a point of staring into Hasan’s eyes from the witness stand. Hasan, 42, who is paralyzed from the chest down and in a wheelchair after being shot by police that day, stared back from a few feet away.
“I wanted him to show some type of remorse or sorrow,” Lunsford said. “And I was telling him, male to male: ‘I’m not afraid of you or anyone like you.’ ”
He said he saw no remorse — only what he called “arrogance” from Hasan.
The day of the shooting, Lunsford was in charge of the Fort Hood center in which soldiers preparing for combat deployments were being processed. He testified in 2010 that Hasan shouted “Allahu Akbar!” — Arabic for “God is great” — and reached under his uniform for a gun. Lunsford, then a sergeant, crouched behind a counter but was spotted by the gunman.
He described locking eyes with Hasan as a red targeting laser flashed across his face. He closed his eyes, he said, and was shot in the face. He collapsed to the floor.
“I decided I wasn’t going to die like that, defenseless on the floor,” he said. “I’m too big and strong to go out like that.”
He got up and struggled to reach an exit as more shots rang out. It was only later, Lunsford said, that he realized he had been shot several more times. Hassan seemed calm and focused, he said: “He wasn’t crazy — he was on a mission.”
Outside the building, Lunsford was treated by soldiers as the shootings continued. He remembered singing “Amazing Grace” to keep himself from going into shock, and laughing — he’s very ticklish, he said — when his boots were removed to check for wounds.
Lunsford, a married father of five, has undergone six surgeries, including facial reconstruction where a bullet cost him his left eye. He originally thought he had been shot five times, he said, but doctors later found two more wounds. 
One bullet remains lodged in his back, and he saved another slug removed from his back last year. A 22-year Army veteran, he retired this year because of his injuries.
Hasan has been permitted to wear a beard in defiance of military regulations and has been dressed in an Army uniform in court despite his objections to wearing a symbol of an American military he has called “an enemy of Islam.”
Lunsford said he intends to wear his Army dress uniform when he testifies. 
“I earned the right to wear that uniform,” he said. “I wear it proudly. I want to show him (Hasan) who’s the better man.”
Since the shooting, Lunsford has volunteered to work with wounded veterans (he coaches an Army wheelchair basketball team). He has spoken to veterans groups and victims rights groups.
In November, he joined more than 130 other victims and family members in a lawsuit against the U.S. government. The suit, which seeks damages for deaths and injuries, contends that the military and FBI knew Hasan was a radical Muslim who supported jihad against the United States but did not take action.

I took that personally.” Lunsford is convinced Hasan will try to bait him, hoping he’ll lose his temper and undermine his testimony. Because Hasan is a psychiatrist familiar with PTSD, Lunsford said, he knows that people with the disorder have difficulty controlling their emotions. “He knows how to push those buttons,” Lunsford said. “The toughest part is trying to control my anger.” At the preliminary hearing, Lunsford made a point of staring into Hasan’s eyes from the witness stand. Hasan, 42, who is paralyzed from the chest down and in a wheelchair after being shot by police that day, stared back from a few feet away. “I wanted him to show some type of remorse or sorrow,” Lunsford said. “And I was telling him, male to male: ‘I’m not afraid of you or anyone like you.’ ” He said he saw no remorse — only what he called “arrogance” from Hasan. The day of the shooting, Lunsford was in charge of the Fort Hood center in which soldiers preparing for combat deployments were being processed. He testified in 2010 that Hasan shouted “Allahu Akbar!” — Arabic for “God is great” — and reached under his uniform for a gun. Lunsford, then a sergeant, crouched behind a counter but was spotted by the gunman. He described locking eyes with Hasan as a red targeting laser flashed across his face. He closed his eyes, he said, and was shot in the face. He collapsed to the floor. “I decided I wasn’t going to die like that, defenseless on the floor,” he said. “I’m too big and strong to go out like that.” He got up and struggled to reach an exit as more shots rang out. It was only later, Lunsford said, that he realized he had been shot several more times. Hassan seemed calm and focused, he said: “He wasn’t crazy — he was on a mission.” Outside the building, Lunsford was treated by soldiers as the shootings continued. He remembered singing “Amazing Grace” to keep himself from going into shock, and laughing — he’s very ticklish, he said — when his boots were removed to check for wounds. Lunsford, a married father of five, has undergone six surgeries, including facial reconstruction where a bullet cost him his left eye. He originally thought he had been shot five times, he said, but doctors later found two more wounds. One bullet remains lodged in his back, and he saved another slug removed from his back last year. A 22-year Army veteran, he retired this year because of his injuries. Hasan has been permitted to wear a beard in defiance of military regulations and has been dressed in an Army uniform in court despite his objections to wearing a symbol of an American military he has called “an enemy of Islam.” Lunsford said he intends to wear his Army dress uniform when he testifies. “I earned the right to wear that uniform,” he said. “I wear it proudly. I want to show him (Hasan) who’s the better man.” Since the shooting, Lunsford has volunteered to work with wounded veterans (he coaches an Army wheelchair basketball team). He has spoken to veterans groups and victims rights groups. In November, he joined more than 130 other victims and family members in a lawsuit against the U.S. government. The suit, which seeks damages for deaths and injuries, contends that the military and FBI knew Hasan was a radical Muslim who supported jihad against the United States but did not take action.

Rare Study Yields Surprising Answer,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/gun-violence-study-scientists-math-firearm-deaths_n_3691087.html,en,False,"law and legislation,gun control,firearms,research",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post What's the best way to curb gun violence in the U.S.? The gun lobby often calls for better law enforcement. Advocates of gun control typically say it's all about better background checks and more laws to limit gun ownership. What does science have to say about gun violence? Until recently, not a whole lot. That's because federal funding for research on firearm violence was largely nonexistent until last January, when President Obama declared firearm deaths a public health crisis, Popular Science reported. But now a provocative study by husband-and-wife scientists at the University of California at Irvine shows that, well, it's complicated. Dominik Wodarz and Natalia Komarova, husband-and-wife researchers at the University of California at Irvine, designed equations to measure which policies save more lives. For the study, the researchers reviewed firearm data stretching all the way back to World War I, and then used mathematical models to calculate the effects on gun deaths of firearm policies ranging from a total ban on guns to a requirement that everyone be armed. The calculations showed that in common domestic and one-on-one crimes, ""stricter gun control could reduce deaths, and indeed that a ban of firearms in the general population would minimize the amount of homicides,"" study co-author Dr. Dominik Wodarz, a mathematical biologist at the university, told The Huffington Post in an email. But the calculations by Wodarz and Dr. Natalia Komarova, a mathematician at the university, also showed that if every American were armed with a gun, the number of deaths resulting from mass shootings might decline. At least it might if we all had sufficient training to avoid shooting the good guys--something that might not be the case. ""If people are well-trained and actually know what they are doing, maybe in a mass shooting people could protect themselves,"" Wodarz told U.S. News. ""But a reality in this country is that a lot of people who have guns are not trained."" If the duo's findings seem ambiguous, Wodarz said the takeaway of the study was anything but: ""As we write in the paper, with the empirical data available at the moment, it appears that a gun ban for the general public is the policy that would reduce the number of deaths the most."" In his email to The Huffington Post, Wodarz said the study had drawn a wide range of responses pro and con, with one pre-publication reviewer going so far as to say that ""mathematics cannot help with reasoning about humans because they are irrational."" Wodarz acknowledged that a firearm ban ""might be an impractical strategy...because of constitutional issues."" But finding a workable plan to end gun deaths wasn't really the researchers' goal in the first place. He said: The aim is to shift the discussion from heated emotional arguments to a discussion about model assumptions, statistical measurements, and logic... We very much hope that this scientific approach to the problem will take off. Then with enough work and with a collective effort from different people in the field, one day we will be able to provide a solid guide for policy. One day sounds like a long time when federal statistics indicate that there are 11,000 firearm homicides a year in the U.S. That's an average of 30 deaths in every 24-hour period. The study, ""Dependence of the Firearm-Related Homicide Rate on Gun Availability: A Mathematical Analysis,"" was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Mansour appointed Mohamed ElBaradei, National Salvation Front general coordinator, as vice president, MENA news reported, quoting presidential spokesman Ahmed al-Moslimani.

Beblawi, an economist, served as finance minister in 2011, following the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak.
Egypt braced for further violence Tuesday as the Muslim Brotherhood called for an uprising after the killing of 53 backers of deposed President Mohamed Morsi.
The Brotherhood called the killings a massacre, saying soldiers opened fire with live ammunition. The Islamist religious, political and social movement emailed links to YouTube videos it alleged showed civilian victims being carried away from the scene of the mass shooting.
Egypt's official media said 435 people were injured in a clash between the military and supporters of Morsi during dawn prayers in Cairo near where Morsi has been held under house arrest since he was ousted last week.
Egypt's military denied the massacre allegations, saying soldiers defended themselves after they were attacked with guns and Molotov cocktails.

""There are limits for patience,"" armed forces spokesman Ahmed Ali said. ""We hope that our message would reach many of the Egyptian people -- we won't allow any tampering with Egyptian national security.""
The military said 42 protesters and a soldier were killed.
Mansour announced a judicial investigation into the killings, but angry crowds massing through the night at a mosque, a focal point for pro-Morsi protests, said the investigation would be meaningless.
In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration was ""deeply concerned by the increasing violence.""
He called on Egypt's military to ""use maximum restraint responding to protesters, just as we urge all those demonstrating to do so peacefully.""
""We also condemn the explicit calls to violence made by the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Carney said.
Despite Monday's violence, Egypt's military-backed government pressed ahead.
Al-Masry al-Youm reported Tuesday Mansour will not amend the Constitutional Declaration issued Monday, outlining a timeline for Egypt's political transition. The declaration envisions a new Parliament within about six months and a presidential election soon afterward.
The declaration calls for two committees to work out amendments to the Islamist-drafted constitution passed under Morsi, Mansour said late Monday.

A referendum on the new document would be held within four months, he said. Elections for a new Parliament would be held two months after that, in February 2014.
Once the new Parliament convenes, it would set new presidential elections within a week.
The declaration issued Monday also authorizes the president, with consent of the cabinet, to declare a state of emergency for as long as three months. Such a declaration could be renewed by a public referendum.
The spokesman for the ultraconservative Nour Party, which represents Salafi Islamist politicians, said on his Facebook page the party was pulling out of negotiations for a new government to protest the killings.
""We will not be silent on the massacre at the Republican Guard today,"" Nadar al-Bakkar wrote. ""We wanted to stop the bloodshed, but now the blood is being shed in rivers. We withdraw from all talks with the new government.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. NEWTOWN, Conn.  – A community foundation tasked with dividing up donations received after the Connecticut school shootings Thursday night made preliminary recommendations on $7.7 million that call for giving $281,000 to each of the families of the 26 children and school educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. The families of 12 surviving children who witnessed the Dec. 14 shootings would each get $20,000; two teachers who were injured would get $150,000 between them. The foundation was asked to divide up $11.4 million that was raised with the help of the United Way. The foundation previously decided to divvy up $7.7 million to the families and survivors and to have committees decide on uses for the remainder of the donations, including whether to use some of it for future mental health care and other needs. The recommendations were released before a public forum Thursday at Newtown's Edmond Town Hall to discuss how to divide the $7.7 million. Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros, special advisers to a distribution committee appointed by the Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation, made the recommendations. ""Is the money adequate? Of course not,"" Feinberg said. ""No amount is adequate to deal with these horrors. Money is a pretty poor substitute but that's what we have. Solomon himself could not distribute this money in a fashion that would please everybody."" The committee met privately before the meeting with some family members. A handful of people commented at the meeting, attended by dozens. Some questioned the process for arriving at the $7.7 million for the families. ""Why isn't all the money going to all the victims? The intent was to give the money to the victims. We're starting from a false premise and this process is re-victimizing the victims,"" said Caryn Kaufman, who represents a coalition of prior mass shooting victims. Jeffrey Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, praised the recommendation to provide money to the 12 children who survived the shootings because he said it recognizes the lasting trauma survivors suffer. Some victims' families have complained the process has caused them anguish by putting them in the difficult place of deciding how to divide the money. The $7.7 million is expected to be paid out next month.

""My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,"" Maj. Nidal Hasan said in a lengthy statement released to Fox News (http://fxn.ws/1cafkA2) on Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, ""I participated in it."" Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted. The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and hasn't spoken much in pre-trial hearings or jury selection. Fox News reported that Hasan didn't directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long. Hasan also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army. ""I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,"" he told Fox News in the statement. Hasan also has objected to the judge's denial of his ""defense of others"" strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents ""an enemy of Islam."""

The lawyers' first-ever admission of their client's actions was made in a motion filed Tuesday and made public Wednesday, The Denver Post reported.

Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses. This week's motion is the first time Holmes' attorneys explicitly said he committed the mass shooting.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Six potential jurors — four colonels and two lieutenant colonels — were brought in from Army posts nationwide and overseas as questioning continued in the court-martial of Maj. Nidal Hasan. The Army psychiatrist faces execution or life in prison without parole if convicted in the 2009 rampage that left 13 dead and nearly three dozen wounded on the Texas Army post. Two of those officers indicated they opposed the death penalty, while a third said he strongly favored it. Prosecutors want all three tossed from the jury pool. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, said she would rule on the request Tuesday. Strongly opposing or supporting the death penalty doesn't disqualify someone from jury service, though potential jurors who indicate they would refuse to consider or automatically impose execution will be dismissed. One colonel brought out for individual questioning said he struggled with the death penalty issue over moral and religious grounds. ""I question whether fallible human beings can impose death on other human beings,"" he told said, adding that he already believes that Hasan is guilty. Hasan is serving as his own attorney but has asked only a few questions of potential jurors, including asking another colonel on Monday whether he would be disobeying God or his church by imposing the death penalty. The colonel, who earlier said he believed, ""thou shalt not kill,"" told Hasan that was a difficult question. A third colonel said he would not always vote to impose a death sentence for certain crimes, although he had indicated he would do so on his jury questionnaire. He also said he believed Hasan is guilty. Hasan's jury will be comprised of 13 to 16 members with ranks equal to his or higher. Death-penalty cases in the military require at least 12 jurors, more than in other cases. And unlike other trials, their verdict must be unanimous in finding guilt or assessing a sentence. Ten potential jurors remain from a group of 20 questioned last week, when jury selection began. Testimony is expected to start Aug. 6. Earlier Monday, Osborn told the group that Hasan was wearing a camouflage uniform worn by troops in combat instead of a dress uniform — usually worn by defendants in a court-martial — because it better meets his health-related needs as a paraplegic. Osborn told potential jurors not to hold his type of uniform against him. Hasan was paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the rampage. Osborn also told the group Hasan was wearing a beard for his religious beliefs and not to hold it against him. Although facial hair violates Army rules, Hasan started growing a beard last summer, saying it was required by his Muslim faith. © 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

Nidal Hassan will represent himself in court FORT HOOD, Texas – The Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage declined to ask potential jurors any questions Tuesday as jury selection finally began in his long-awaited murder trial. Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is serving as his own attorney, didn't take notes or confer with his former defense attorneys who will help if he asks. During the nearly two-hour proceeding with the first group of 20 potential jurors, Hasan sat quietly in his wheelchair as the judge gave preliminary instructions and read about 300 witness names to find out if any of the Army officers knew them. Hasan, 42, faces execution or life without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 count of attempted premeditated murder. Maj. Larry Downend, one of the prosecutors, asked the group if they agreed that the defendant's choice of weapon and a motive could show premeditation. Everyone in the group nodded yes. All officers indicated they had no moral opposition to imposing a death sentence, but also said they didn't believe execution was the only punishment for someone convicted of premeditated murder. After the group from Army posts nationwide was questioned by the judge and prosecutors, Hasan said he had no questions for the jury pool. Six potential jurors were dismissed at prosecutors' request, based on some of their answers in court Tuesday and to the lengthy jury questionnaires they turned in weeks ago. One officer said he knew one of the 13 killed on Nov. 5, 2009. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told the group that Hasan was wearing a camouflage uniform worn by troops in combat instead of a dress uniform -- usually worn by defendants in a court-martial -- because it better meets his health-related needs as a paraplegic. Hasan was paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the rampage. Osborn told potential jurors not to hold his type of uniform against him. At a hearing earlier Tuesday, Hasan said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a uniform that he believes represents ""an enemy of Islam."" Hasan, an American-born Muslim, had said he didn't want to wear either military uniform. Before jury selection began, Osborn told Hasan that she would not relay that to the jury pool but that he could during his questioning. Osborn also told the group that Hasan was wearing a beard for his religious beliefs and not to hold it against him. Although facial hair violates Army rules, Hasan started growing a beard last summer, saying it was required by his Muslim faith. The judge said security measures at the courthouse were ""for all trial participants"" and told jurors not to consider that as any evidence in the case. The one-story courthouse on the edge of the Texas Army post is surrounded by hundreds of stacked freight car-size shipping containers, and by tall dirt- and sand-filled barriers designed to protect it against the impact of a bomb blast. Armed soldiers stand guard around the building. Individual questioning of potential jurors was to start Wednesday. Jury selection is expected to last at least a month. Groups of 20 will be brought in each week until 13 jurors are chosen for Hasan's trial. The initial jury pool was 140 officers, but because of several trial delays, some have left the military through retirement or their service ending, Fort Hood officials said. It's unclear how many potential jurors remain. Death-penalty cases in the military require at least 12 jury members, more than in other cases. And unlike other trials, their verdict must be unanimous in finding guilt or assessing a sentence.

Kirkpatrick CAIRO — In the square where liberals and Islamists once chanted together for democracy, demonstrators now carry posters hailing as a national hero the general who ousted the country’s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood. Liberal talk-show hosts denounce the Brotherhood as a foreign menace and its members as “sadistic, extremely violent creatures” unfit for political life. A leading human rights advocate blames the Brotherhood’s “filthy” leaders for the deaths of more than 50 of their own supporters in a mass shooting by soldiers and the police. A hypernationalist euphoria unleashed in Egypt by the toppling of Mr. Morsi has swept up even liberals and leftists who spent years struggling against the country’s previous military-backed governments. An unpopular few among them have begun to raise alarms about what they are calling signs of “fascism”: the fervor in the streets, the glorification of the military as it tightens its grip and the enthusiastic cheers for the suppression of the Islamists. But the vast majority of liberals, leftists and intellectuals in Egypt have joined in the jubilation at the defeat of the Muslim Brotherhood, laying into any dissenters. “We are moving from the bearded chauvinistic right to the clean-shaven chauvinistic right,” said Rabab el-Mahdi, a left-leaning scholar at the American University in Cairo. Many Egyptians are overwhelmed with dual emotions: relief at the end of an Islamist government that many called arrogant and ineffective, and a thrill at their power to topple presidents. The voices on the left who might be expected to raise alarms about the military’s ouster of a freely elected government are instead reveling in what they see as the country’s escape from the threat that an Islamist majority would steadily push Egypt to the right. Many on the left are still locked in a battle of semantics, trying to persuade the world — and perhaps one another — that the overthrow of Mr. Morsi was not a “coup” but a “revolution.” The army merely carried out the popular will, they insist. On Sunday, one private satellite network in Egypt was running commercials of citizen testimonials proclaiming as much. Some have begun to voice doubts. Amr Hamzawy, a political scientist who held a seat in the dissolved Parliament, was among the first to condemn the military’s shutdown of the Islamists’ satellite networks, the arrest of their staff members, and the detention of Mr. Morsi and hundreds of other Islamist leaders. Mr. Hamzawy objected in a recent newspaper column to “the rhetoric of gloating, hatred, retribution and revenge against the Muslim Brotherhood.” After the mass shooting, he called the celebration of the military takeover “fascism under the false pretense of democracy and liberalism.” Fellow intellectuals who said nothing, he wrote, were “the birds of darkness of this phase.” But he was almost alone. A chorus of liberals and leftists rushed to denounce Mr. Hamzawy for defending the Islamists. Khaled Montaser, a liberal columnist, declared that the Islamists were worse than “criminals and psychopaths” because they could never reform. “Their treason, terrorism and conspiracies are an indelible tattoo,” Mr. Montaser wrote. “They do not know the meaning of ‘homeland.’ They only know the meaning of ‘the caliphate’ and their organization first.” Ahmed Maher, a founder of the left-leaning April 6 group, initially joined a small volunteer team that tried to enlist Western support for the ouster. But after the arrests and shootings of Brotherhood supporters, he began to recall the generals’ long hold on power after mass protests drove President Hosni Mubarak from office two years ago. Mr. Maher put his worries about the generals in a Twitter message to another activist: “If we assume it’s not a coup, and I tell people it’s not a coup, when they screw us again like they did in 2011, what would I tell people?” His allies responded by trying to drum him out, not only from the volunteer team but also from the April 6 group. Esraa Abdel Fattah, a prominent activist, campaigned against him in the media and circulated a list of his statements questioning the “coup.” And Ms. Abdel Fattah insisted that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party won the post-Mubarak elections, amounted to a foreign-backed terrorist group. “When terrorism is trying to take hold of Egypt and foreign interference is trying to dig into our domestic affairs, then it’s inevitable for the great Egyptian people to support its armed forces against the foreign danger,” Ms. Abdel Fattah wrote in a newspaper column. In the turbulent period of military rule after Mr. Mubarak was ousted, many liberals and leftists stood shoulder to shoulder with Islamists to demand that the generals relinquish power to elected civilians. Now the liberals appear to have joined in a public amnesia about the abuses and scandals of that period — the forced virginity tests of female protesters; Coptic Christian demonstrators shot by soldiers or run over with armored vehicles; the videotaped stripping and kicking of a female demonstrator who became known as the Blue Bra Woman. The activist Hassan Shaheen was captured in the same video, bleeding from the head as a soldier stomped on his chest. But this spring he helped lead the petition drive asking the military to remove Mr. Morsi. And he joined in the rejection of Mr. Maher, saying that by calling the ouster of Mr. Morsi a “coup” he was “following the rhetoric of the Muslim Brotherhood.” “We will stand together, the people and the military, in the face of terrorism,” Mr. Shaheen wrote in a Twitter message, arguing that the Brotherhood’s political party “must be dissolved and all its leaders must be arrested.” “No negotiation, no reconciliation, no going back,” he added. Hossam Bahgat, founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said the liberals’ goal — an Egypt governed by an inclusive civilian democracy — appeared to be further away than when Mr. Mubarak fell. Now, he said, the old institutions and elites from the Mubarak era are emboldened to push for a full return of the old order. “There is a powerful and well-resourced player now trying to push Egypt back to 2010,” he said. Even those on the left who are critical of the military overthrow fault Mr. Morsi and the Brotherhood for their actions in power, for excluding other groups from decision-making, accusing critics of treason and exploiting religion as a political tool. They say that in recent days some Islamist leaders have told their supporters to prepare to use violence to defend Mr. Morsi, as they did during a crisis in December. Brotherhood leaders say their organization has not condoned violence in Egypt since the days of British rule. They say private media outlets have worked for months to stir up nationalist sentiment against them, for example by circulating false rumors that they were considering giving away Sinai or selling the Suez Canal. Over the last week, many news outlets have claimed that Brotherhood leaders invited foreign interference by appealing for help from Washington to hold off the military takeover. Television hosts even assert that the crowds at pro-Morsi rallies are actually full of Syrians and Palestinians. The military has set the mood as well. Before the takeover, it broadcast aerial images of the protests against Mr. Morsi, set to soaring martial music. On Sunday, it released another 30-minute broadcast depicting soldiers protecting the public, set to a similar score. State and private television channels also broadcast images of Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi in his trademark black beret, explaining to admiring soldiers the military’s obligation to intervene in the national interest. “Egypt is the mother of the world, and Egypt will be as great as the world,” he declared. Much of the public, fatigued by revolutionary turmoil, has embraced him. “The people had been saying, ‘Down, down with military rule,’ but Sisi completely changed them,” said Mohamed Mofeed, 38, a barber in downtown Cairo. “They love him.” Mr. Morsi “should have been tougher with the media,” he added. “They were disrespecting him all over the place.” Osama Mohamed, 20, a student sitting with a group of friends, said they wanted General Sisi to “leave his office and elect himself president.” Mohamed Abdel Fattah, 24, an advertising manager, agreed. “For Egypt,” he said, “democracy is chaos.” Advertisement"
702105351,2013-08-02 10:23:47,Sikh Shooting Anniversary In Oak Creek Remembered By Community | HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/sikh-shooting-anniversary_n_3695333.html,en,False,"motion pictures,religion and churches",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"ROCKVILLE, Md. (RNS) One year after a gunman opened fire in a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., killing six worshippers, Sikhs say they are hopeful about the future and even more determined to be better understood. “The legacy of Oak Creek is not one of bloodshed,” said Valarie Kaur, founding director of the interfaith group Groundswell, a project of Auburn Seminary in N.Y. “(It’s of) how a community rose to bring people together to heal and to organize for lasting social change,” she told the PBS television program “Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly.” Sikhs first came to the U.S. 100 years ago, and they now number about half a million people. Many say they continue to face discrimination and misunderstanding. Sikh men are often mistaken for Muslims because of their turbans and beards. Following the Sept. 11, 2011 attacks, Sikhs have often been wrongly targeted. An activist and a filmmaker, Kaur made a film about Oak Creek and was on site when the temple or gurdwara, reopened. She said her first reaction to news of the mass shooting was despair. Then her phone started to ring. “People from all different colors and faiths were reaching out to me personally to tell me that they were with us,” she said. “There was an outpouring of love and support that the Sikh community had never experienced before.” Soon after the massacre on Aug. 5, 2012, Oak Creek Sikhs gathered to pray for each of the victims. They then named the gunman, Wade Michael Page, who fatally shot himself in the parking lot, and prayed for him, too. In the weeks that followed, numerous interfaith vigils and special events were held in solidarity with the community. It was a source of encouragement for Sikhs, but also an opportunity to educate people about their religion. Sikh leaders say a new sense of identity began building in the community. “A lot of Sikhs have come out stronger because they felt this is the time my community needs me,” said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education. One year later, Sikhs can point to solid accomplishments. An interfaith campaign led by the Sikh Coalition and other groups successfully pushed the U.S. government to begin tracking hate crimes against Sikhs and other religious minorities. Now the community is urging the military to change its policies banning service members from wearing turbans or uncut hair. At Camp Gurmat, a summer camp in Maryland for Sikh-American kids, young campers such as Jagjot Kaur, 15, say they take pride in being a Sikh. “Every time I see somebody I’ll tell them that I’m a Sikh and I’ll tell them what Sikhs are all about,” she said. Others, like 15-year-old Harnoor Singh, try to combat bullying at school and counter the kids who call him Osama (after Osama bin Laden). “If you don’t tell them right there that, ‘No, I’m actually not a Muslim, I’m a Sikh. This is what we believe in. This is who we are. And we are in no way affiliated with any terrorist group,’ that ignorance keeps spreading and eventually, you have every Sikh kid made fun of,” he said. Many Sikhs say the Oak Creek tragedy drew them closer to their faith, and especially to the teaching that they must maintain a spirit of “chardi kala,” (CHAR’-dee KAH’-lah), or optimism and hope. “Even though we still face profiling and bullying and racial slurs and continued hate-violence, despite all of this, I still have deep hope, because I look to the resilience and the courage embodied in our young people,” said Kaur. “I know that this generation, like generations before it, will carry on the banner of chardi kala, the Sikh spirit, and the American spirit for years to come.” (A version of this story was first broadcast on the PBS television program “Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly” (www.pbs.org/religion.))"

The event was marked not only by remembrances of the 12 killed and 58 wounded on July 20, 2012, but also for hundreds of gun violence victims across the country, whose names were read aloud for more than 11 hours leading up to the moment shots rang out one year ago, at 12:38 a.m. And despite that it was attended by vocal groups on both sides of the gun control debate that are used to locking horns over the issue, it was largely subdued and respectful. Gun rights groups called for a counter rally earlier in the week because New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, organized the event. Some Second Amendment advocates saw that as a crass exploitation of the tragedy for political gain. “They’re walking on the graves of these victims to get to the cameras and microphones to advance gun control,” Dudley Brown, the director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, told a local TV station the day before the event. “We’re answering it by encouraging gun owners to show up as well. This is a clear case of politicians — Mayor Bloomberg — using the tragedies to advance his gun control agenda and we’re going to answer that every time.” Advocates for gun control compared Brown’s call for a counter-protest to the Westboro Baptist Church, the Kansas group that belligerently protests the funerals of service members and others to express their disagreement with gay rights issues. The group wasn’t allowed inside a fenced area where the event was held because the area had been exclusively reserved by MAIG. They stood well within earshot and sight of the speakers and their families, however. The families of shooting victims from Aurora, Columbine and Newtown spoke emotionally about their loses before several speakers began reciting the names of people killed by gun violence. Theater shooting survivor Stephen Barton had stopped in Aurora a year ago while on a cross-country cycling trip and treated his host to the midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.” He and his friends arrived early to get good seats, “not knowing that which seats we chose were going to have a pretty serious impact on our future,” he said. Barton was shot in the face, neck and torso with a shotgun, “and just like that, our lives were turned upside down.” Attorneys for accused gunman James Holmes admitted in court papers that Holmes opened fire on the packed theater. Police say he carried a variety of weapons — including a shotgun, an AR-15 with a 100-round drum magazine and a handgun — and he was arrested outside the theater’s rear exit wearing head-to-toe body armor. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, and Holmes’ attorneys have said he was in the middle of a “psychotic episode.” He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Barton’s brush with gun violence didn’t end with Aurora — he lives near Newtown, Conn., the site of a horrific mass shooting just five months later when Adam Lanza gunned down 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Most of his victims were children. Those experiences led to Barton’s involvement with Bloomberg’s MAIG, where he acts as an outreach and policy associate. “Like most Americans, I never believed that I would be a victim of gun violence,” he said. “I wish I cared earlier about this issue.” The shootings in Newtown and Aurora were also behind historic new laws in Colorado that place limits on certain weapon components and new responsibilities on the people who buy and sell guns. Among the controversial new laws are bans on ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds, and universal background checks, even for private sales or trades, to be paid for by the buyer. Despite explosive opposition by gun-rights advocates, the laws easily passed through the Democratic controlled state legislature, were signed by Gov. John Hickenlooper and went into effect July 1. But the political fallout continues. Just days before the theater massacre’s one-year anniversary, a Denver judge ruled against two Democratic senators who had supported the bills, and who were trying to have recall elections against them tossed out on a technicality. A company that manufactures 30-round magazines is preparing to move out of state because of the new laws. And as many as 10 rural counties held meetings to seriously discuss breaking away from Colorado to form the 51st state. Gun control, among other issues advanced by Democrats during the legislative session, has energized the Republican Party for the 2014 elections. But more than anything, the new gun laws have kept tensions at a low boil between those on both sides of the debate. The counter-protesters saw the involvement of MAIG in Friday’s event as a direct provocation. “Absolutely, it’s political,” said Dan Englert, an engineer from Denver who rode his bike, adorned with a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, to the event. “Mayors Against Illegal Guns, what an oxymoron. That’s just a way of saying they’re against guns.” Englert said that if people had been allowed to carry concealed weapons in places like the Aurora theater, the massacre could have been either prevented or stopped before it had gotten as bad as it had. “Or it could have been worse,” countered Carole Bell to Englert, an older woman wearing a “No More Gun Violence” pin and a picture of her late 14-year-old son on a locket. Bell’s son was killed in an accidental shooting in Denver in 1981 and she moved to the United States from her native Great Britain so that she could gain citizenship and vote to strengthen gun laws. But despite such deeply entrenched differences, that brief exchange was as close as anyone came to having a confrontation over the issue. Barton said that despite the clear political charge lately over gun control, it was appropriate for MAIG to bring its “No More Names” tour to Aurora for the anniversary. “Speaking as a survivor, everyone has their own opinions” about whether the political debate over gun control should be raised during sensitive times like anniversaries of deadly events. Because gun violence happens every day in America, he said, there’s no opportunity to let the shock of a shooting subside before starting the debate. “If we can’t talk about it on the anniversary of these issues, when can we talk about it?” he asked.

Major Nidal Malik Hasan, 42, could face the death penalty if convicted of carrying out the mass shooting at a processing center where hundreds of soldiers were preparing to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. The November 2009 incident is the worst shooting on a military base in U.S. history. It shocked the military and led to an outcry for greater security from “homegrown” terror acts. Hasan is also accused of wounding 32 fellow soldiers during the Fort Hood massacre — people who may end up being cross-examined by Hasan after he fired his lawyers and opted to represent himself. Hasan wanted to use a “defense of others” strategy to justify his actions. But military judge Colonel Tara Osborn prohibited him from doing so after ruling that the argument had no merit. In a copy of Hasan’s intended opening statement obtained by AFP, he acknowledged that “it’s not going to be easy” to convince a jury made up of soldiers that his actions were justified. Hasan wrote that he planned to prove that the United States had engaged in an “illegal war” in Afghanistan and that “I did what I thought was necessary to help.” “I want to convey to you that my actions were meant to defend a people who were attacked by the United States,” Hasan wrote. “It took a lot of courage for me to help defend the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” he added. It is not clear what Hasan will say when the court martial gets underway in a few weeks now that he has been barred from offering any evidence or testimony indicating he believed he was saving the lives of Muslims in Afghanistan when he admittedly opened fire. Many military law experts agreed with the judge’s ban, but Hasan’s advocates argue that it violates his constitutional rights to a fair trial. “I think that defense is obscene,” said Richard Rosen, a military law professor at Texas Tech University. “That would justify shooting the president because he is targeting the Taliban and leaders of Al-Qaeda. It’s offensive.” Rosen agreed with Osborn’s recent ruling, which he said was “reasonable and not overly tough.” Hasan’s former defense attorney John Galligan, a retired Army colonel, called the trial a “kangaroo court.” “She’s essentially said you’ll never hear from Nidal Hasan,” Galligan told AFP. “It’s a major, major error.” Hasan has managed to delay his trial with various legal manuevers and a lengthy battle over whether he could violate military rules by wearing a beard. He raised the possibility of a further delay in May by firing his lawyers just days before jury selection was set to begin and then requesting a three-month delay to prepare his defense. He withdrew the request for a delay after Osborn barred the defense of others strategy. Hasan has told the court he would like to plead guilty to all charges. However, U.S. military law prevents a soldier from pleading guilty to capital charges unless the death penalty is waived. An FBI review showed Hasan had been in contact with the U.S.-born cleric Anwar al’Awlaqi, a key figure in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen. Hasan, who was born in Virginia to Palestinian parents, had attended a mosque in 2001 where Awlaqi worked. Hasan exchanged emails with Awlaqi in the months leading up to the shooting in which he questioned the morality of killing soldiers if they intended to attack Muslims. Awlaqi later called Hasan a hero. Know first. The opinions that matter. Delivered to your inbox every morning ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

""My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,"" Maj. Nidal Hasan said in a lengthy statement released to Fox News on Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, ""I participated in it."" Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted. The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and has made similar declarations during pre-trial hearings and jury selection. Fox News reported that Hasan didn't directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long. Hasan also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army. ""I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,"" he told Fox News in the statement. Hasan also has objected to the judge's denial of his ""defense of others"" strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents ""an enemy of Islam."" © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

By ELIAS GROLL 07/22/2011 03:15 PM EDT Updated 07/23/2011 08:36 PM EDT Details of two deadly attacks Friday in Norway quickly outpaced U.S. officials’ initial responses, which assumed the bombing in Oslo and a mass shooting at a youth camp outside the city were the work of a terrorist organization. But by late Friday, police and government officials in the Scandinavian country were comparing the attacks to the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City — as the work of one of its own citizens, unrelated to Al Qaeda or any other terror movement. The attacks have claimed nearly 100 lives, including an estimated 7 who died when a bomb explosion ripped through the main government building in downtown Oslo. As many as 80 died on the island of Utøya, where the the suspected gunman — identifed as 32-year-old Anders Breivik — attacked a youth summer camp run by the country’s ruling political party. “It seems it’s not Islamic-terror related,” a Norwegian official said, according to The Associated Press. “This seems like a madman’s work.” The official said the attack “is probably more Norway’s Oklahoma City than it is Norway’s World Trade Center.” But earlier in the day, just hours after the bomb exploded in Oslo and long before authorities there captured the alleged gunman, President Barack Obama had said the events in Norway are a reminder that stopping terrorism is a global responsibility. “I wanted to personally extend my condolences to the people of Norway,” Obama said at the White House after meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. “It’s a reminder that the entire international community holds a stake in preventing this kind of terror from occurring. We have to work cooperatively together both on intelligence and in terms of prevention of these kinds of horrible attacks.” The State Department issued a similar statement and said it had no reports that any Americans were hurt in either attack. A police official said investigators believe “this is not linked to any international terrorist organizations at all.” “It seems it’s not Islamic-terror related,” the official said. “This seems like a madman’s work.” At a press conference late Friday night, a spokesperson for the Oslo police said that they had found undetonated explosives on the island, though he declined to specify the quantity or type of explosives.

This courtroom sketch shows military prosecutor Lt. Col. Steve Henricks, right, speaking as Nidal Malik Hasan, center, and presiding judge Col. Tara Osborn look on during his court-martial Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2013, in Forth Hood, Texas.  Hasan is representing himself against charges of murder and attempted murder for the 2009 attack that left 13 people dead at Forth Hood. (AP Photo/Brigitte Woosley) FORT HOOD — One of the biggest capital murder trials in U.S. military history came to an abrupt halt on its second day as Maj. Nidal Hasan's standby counsel team asked that its role in the proceeding be modified. Lawyers on the team said Hasan is intentionally seeking the death penalty in his court-martial. The military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, cleared the court Wednesday morning so she could conduct a closed hearing on the matter. The trial in the 2009 shooting that left 13 people dead and 31 wounded is scheduled to resume Thursday morning. It remains to be seen how the motion filed by Lt. Col Kris Poppe and two other lawyers on Hasan's standby counsel will impact the high-profile trial. Poppe, Hasan's former lead defense attorney, has long expressed misgivings about the role of his team since Hasan sought to represent himself earlier this year. In a discussion outside the jury's presence, Poppe told the judge it became clear when testimony began Tuesday that Hasan was attempting to remove obstacles to the death penalty — something the standby defense team found “repugnant.” He said Hasan, who has seldom raised objections or questioned witnesses or prospective jury members, has been “engaging to working toward the death penalty.” That statement drew a defiant reaction from Hasan, who is serving as his own attorney, with the standby counsel team present. “Your honor, I object. That's a twist of the facts,” Hasan said. Poppe said the jury selection process was “wholly inadequate.” But Hasan denied that he's trying to improve the prosecution's chances of having a conviction and death sentence unanimously approved by the jury. “Your honor, Col. Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate,” he said. “It's inaccurate, and I'd like to clarify that.” The judge then cleared the courtroom. She later recessed court until Thursday. Osborn, who had said she intended to begin testimony on time and keep the trial moving forward, said she received the motion “late last night” and has also received four attachments, including an unspecified “Fox News media report.” Col. Michael Mulligan, lead attorney for the government, said he was “concerned with the body of the motion.” The judge ordered the motion and its attachments sealed. Osborn said she was “confused” by the motion and its intent. She asked Poppe if he and the other members of the standby counsel, Lt. Col. Christopher E. Martin and Maj. Joseph T. Marcee, wanted to continue to be involved in the case at all. “The motion seems to be at war with itself, Col. Poppe,” she said. Poppe said he, Martin and Marcee are willing to assist Hasan “if he's ready to fight the death penalty,” but does not want to be forced to participate in a trial spectacle that is “repugnant to defense counsel.” Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the worst shooting of its kind on a U.S. military base. The attempted premeditated murder charges relate to 31 people who were wounded and a contract police officer, Mark Todd, who came under fire by the shooter. Hasan, if convicted, could get the death penalty or life in prison. Texas Tech University law school professor Richard Rosen, a retired Army colonel, said it wasn't clear what Poppe was seeking. Defense attorneys in the role of standby counsel conduct research for the accused, and may or may not provide legal advice. They also can return as full-fledged defense attorneys at the defendant's request. Rosen said it was clear that Poppe and his team are wrestling with a supreme ethical dilemma. ""I think he's concerned about the fact that his client wants the death penalty, at least that's what I understood form what I heard,"" said Rosen, a former Army lawyer who is sitting in on the proceedings here. ""And he thinks it's ethically improper for him to serve as a standby counsel for someone who's seeking the death penalty when his role should be to ensure that he does not get the death penalty,"" said Rosen, a former deputy legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Asked if the issue had been a problem in past military trials, Rosen said, ""I've never seen anything like this in 26 years on active duty."" Media organizations covering the trial at Fort Hood are operating under strictly enforced “access and ground rules” approved by the military judge. Reporters are not allowed to use recording devices in the courtroom, or in a remote location where a live, closed-circuit television feed provides audio of the testimony and courtroom discussion, and visual images of the military judge and witnesses who testify. Eleven seats are set aside in the courtroom gallery for credentialed media under a “pool” system that provides access for news wire and local, regional and national print, radio and television journalists. Osborn, noting a full gallery Tuesday that included victims' family members, said before the jury entered the courtroom that in spite of the powerful emotions of the trial, outward expressions of joy, sadness, anger or other feelings would not be tolerated in court. “Spectators will remain silent during all proceedings,” Osborn said. “We're going to carry on in a calm, quiet and dignified manner.” Thomas Rheinlander, Fort Hood public affairs officer, said the media ground rules are aimed at achieving a delicate balance between access to the trial and security concerns. Osborn has approved rules that give the media access to report the proceedings to the public, while ensuring public safety and the integrity of the legal process, Rheinlander told reporters just before the trial began Tuesday. “She gave it to us, but she can take it away,” he said. “It's that critical for force protection issues.” Fort Hood officials said 102 media personnel representing 41 agencies converged on the post for the first day of the trial on Tuesday. That has leveled off to 68 journalists from 26 media organizations today. shuddleston@express-news.net Scott Huddleston is a veteran staff writer, covering Bexar County government, local history, preservation and the Alamo.

Hasan is representing himself against charges of murder and attempted murder for the 2009 attack that left 13 people dead at Forth Hood. (AP Photo/Brigitte Woosley) FORT HOOD — One of the biggest capital murder trials in U.S. military history came to an abrupt halt on its second day as Maj. Nidal Hasan's standby counsel team asked that its role in the proceeding be modified. Lawyers on the team said Hasan is intentionally seeking the death penalty in his court-martial. The military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, cleared the court Wednesday morning so she could conduct a closed hearing on the matter. The trial in the 2009 shooting that left 13 people dead and 31 wounded is scheduled to resume Thursday morning. It remains to be seen how the motion filed by Lt. Col Kris Poppe and two other lawyers on Hasan's standby counsel will impact the high-profile trial. Poppe, Hasan's former lead defense attorney, has long expressed misgivings about the role of his team since Hasan sought to represent himself earlier this year. In a discussion outside the jury's presence, Poppe told the judge it became clear when testimony began Tuesday that Hasan was attempting to remove obstacles to the death penalty — something the standby defense team found “repugnant.” He said Hasan, who has seldom raised objections or questioned witnesses or prospective jury members, has been “engaging to working toward the death penalty.” That statement drew a defiant reaction from Hasan, who is serving as his own attorney, with the standby counsel team present. “Your honor, I object. That's a twist of the facts,” Hasan said. Poppe said the jury selection process was “wholly inadequate.” But Hasan denied that he's trying to improve the prosecution's chances of having a conviction and death sentence unanimously approved by the jury. “Your honor, Col. Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate,” he said. “It's inaccurate, and I'd like to clarify that.” The judge then cleared the courtroom. She later recessed court until Thursday. Osborn, who had said she intended to begin testimony on time and keep the trial moving forward, said she received the motion “late last night” and has also received four attachments, including an unspecified “Fox News media report.” Col. Michael Mulligan, lead attorney for the government, said he was “concerned with the body of the motion.” The judge ordered the motion and its attachments sealed. Osborn said she was “confused” by the motion and its intent. She asked Poppe if he and the other members of the standby counsel, Lt. Col. Christopher E. Martin and Maj. Joseph T. Marcee, wanted to continue to be involved in the case at all. “The motion seems to be at war with itself, Col. Poppe,” she said. Poppe said he, Martin and Marcee are willing to assist Hasan “if he's ready to fight the death penalty,” but does not want to be forced to participate in a trial spectacle that is “repugnant to defense counsel.” Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the worst shooting of its kind on a U.S. military base. The attempted premeditated murder charges relate to 31 people who were wounded and a contract police officer, Mark Todd, who came under fire by the shooter. Hasan, if convicted, could get the death penalty or life in prison. Texas Tech University law school professor Richard Rosen, a retired Army colonel, said it wasn't clear what Poppe was seeking. Defense attorneys in the role of standby counsel conduct research for the accused, and may or may not provide legal advice. They also can return as full-fledged defense attorneys at the defendant's request. Rosen said it was clear that Poppe and his team are wrestling with a supreme ethical dilemma. ""I think he's concerned about the fact that his client wants the death penalty, at least that's what I understood form what I heard,"" said Rosen, a former Army lawyer who is sitting in on the proceedings here. ""And he thinks it's ethically improper for him to serve as a standby counsel for someone who's seeking the death penalty when his role should be to ensure that he does not get the death penalty,"" said Rosen, a former deputy legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Asked if the issue had been a problem in past military trials, Rosen said, ""I've never seen anything like this in 26 years on active duty."" Media organizations covering the trial at Fort Hood are operating under strictly enforced “access and ground rules” approved by the military judge. Reporters are not allowed to use recording devices in the courtroom, or in a remote location where a live, closed-circuit television feed provides audio of the testimony and courtroom discussion, and visual images of the military judge and witnesses who testify. Eleven seats are set aside in the courtroom gallery for credentialed media under a “pool” system that provides access for news wire and local, regional and national print, radio and television journalists. Osborn, noting a full gallery Tuesday that included victims' family members, said before the jury entered the courtroom that in spite of the powerful emotions of the trial, outward expressions of joy, sadness, anger or other feelings would not be tolerated in court. “Spectators will remain silent during all proceedings,” Osborn said. “We're going to carry on in a calm, quiet and dignified manner.” Thomas Rheinlander, Fort Hood public affairs officer, said the media ground rules are aimed at achieving a delicate balance between access to the trial and security concerns. Osborn has approved rules that give the media access to report the proceedings to the public, while ensuring public safety and the integrity of the legal process, Rheinlander told reporters just before the trial began Tuesday. “She gave it to us, but she can take it away,” he said. “It's that critical for force protection issues.” Fort Hood officials said 102 media personnel representing 41 agencies converged on the post for the first day of the trial on Tuesday. That has leveled off to 68 journalists from 26 media organizations today. shuddleston@express-news.net Scott Huddleston is a veteran staff writer, covering Bexar County government, local history, preservation and the Alamo.

150062243,2013-07-25 05:12:42,Joe Manchin is not done with gun control. Does it matter?,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/04/29/joe-manchin-is-not-done-with-gun-control-does-it-matter/,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,elections,lobbying and lobbyists,gun control,firearms",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old Eleven days after the amendment he co-authored to expand background checks for gun purchases was rejected by his Senate colleagues, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sounded optimistic Sunday about a second try. “I'm willing to go anywhere in this country, I'm going to debate anybody on this issue, read the bill and you tell me what you don't like,” Manchin said on “Fox News Sunday,” reiterating his intention to bring his measure back to the Senate floor. Mission impossible? No. But the rebooted fight Manchin is promising will face long odds during the next 18 months for a simple reason: High-profile political battles like the one over guns don’t happen in a vacuum. Even after intense lobbying by President Obama, winning bipartisan support, and polling that showed 90 percent of Americans supported the idea, the push to expand background checks failed. After the vote, an angry Obama vowed the fight was not over and Manchin and other advocates have suggested losing the round doesn’t amount to losing the bout. The thing is, there are other fights that will require a great deal of attention and political capital from Obama and congressional Democrats in the coming months. And they won’t be easy. There’s the effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, a high priority for Democrats that some conservatives are already trying to stall. Then there’s the prospect of striking a long-term deficit reduction deal, the kind of “grand bargain” on fiscal issues that has eluded Obama and Republicans so far, but neither party has given up on this time around. Sure, a retooled push for gun control informed by the failure of the most recent effort sounds on its own like it could work. And it’s not just Manchin who is moving forward with a renewed push. The New York Times reported last week that other lawmakers are also trying to break new ground. But there is only so much Obama and Democratic leaders can fight for on Capitol Hill. And pressing for something that was just rejected isn’t the best way to shore up one’s political standing ahead of high-stakes battles on other issues. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has shelved gun legislation for now. Even Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Manchin’s Republican partner on background checks, said last week he intends to turn his attention to fiscal issues. (Though Manchin said Sunday Toomey is “totally committed to this bill.”) “Until we have such reason to believe that we’d have a different outcome I think the issue is resolved by the Senate,"" Toomey said on Friday. ""I accept when the Senate speaks and so I’ve turned my attention to the fiscal and economic matters that I’ve normally focused on."" What's more, the gun debate isn’t unfolding in an electoral vacuum any more than it’s happening in a legislative one. Two of the four Democrats who opposed the measure are up for reelection in red states next year. Why does this matter? For background checks to pass on a second try, five “no” votes would have to become “yes” votes. So even if say, retiring Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who isn’t up for reelection until 2018, both flipped, three more senators would need to follow suit. And it’s hard to imagine 2014ers Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas flipping as Election Day draws even nearer. Gun control advocates would need to win new Republican “yes” votes if Pryor and Begich didn't flip, which would be no small task. In the wake of the mass shooting in Newtown Conn., last year, the debate over guns had a clear moment in this Congress, and senators rejected new restrictions. That doesn’t mean gun control laws cannot be passed in the long term, but it’s hard to see how the Joe Manchins of the world will have much success in the near term.

Since the end of the second world war, Jews the world over have pledged that the Holocaust can never happen again. The guns rights lobby has perverted this pledge for their own use – to advocate against stricter gun safety laws. The NRA's Wayne LaPierre has argued that firearm registration in Germany in 1938 helped lead to the Holocaust. Charlton Heston rallied NRA members by connecting gun rights with the Holocaust by declaiming ""first comes registration and then confiscation"". At the NRA convention this past May, conservative media personality Glenn Beck likened New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to a Nazi. And just in the last couple of weeks, former cop and pro-gun pundit Frank Borelli, speaking on NRA News, applauded sheriffs in Maryland who refused to enforce that state's recently adopted gun safety laws by distinguishing them from Nazi guards who followed orders in the death camps.  As a resident of Sandy Hook and the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors, I find the NRA's attempt to draw on the Nazis' annihilation of my ancestors to further their political and business objectives to be dishonest, offensive and callously calculated to scare Americans into fighting laws that will save lives. My grandparents met on a train fleeing Poland. They fell in love and married; my mother was born in Riga in the Baltic states in 1942. To escape death from the Nazis in Riga, my grandmother took my mom to Moscow and placed her in a Catholic orphanage where she remained until after the war. My grandparents and mother lived because they were able to move between the shadows, remain a few steps ahead of the SS, and they received assistance from non-Jews, who risked their lives to help them. Their survival had nothing to do with a gun. My grandparents and my mother immigrated to the United States when my mom was 18, and my grandmother learned that two of her brothers had survived and were living in Buffalo, New York. Although my grandfather had fought in the Israeli army, including during the war of independence, in all the years he lived in the United States, he never owned a firearm. My mother not only never owned a gun, but did not allow my brother or me to have BB guns or toy guns in the house. After seeing what happened in my town of Sandy Hook, she is now a staunch supporter of gun safety legislation. Yes, that's right, a Holocaust survivor supporting background checks. I am certain if my grandparents were alive today, they too would advocate for background checks and other common sense measures to reduce gun violence. They would not fear registration – the Manchin-Toomey proposal specifically prohibited it. They would point out that Maryland sheriffs enforcing gun safety laws are not the same as Nazi guards following orders to murder Jews. In fact, it is just the opposite, as the new laws in Maryland will save lives. Unfortunately, the only similarity between Nazi Germany and Sandy Hook is that innocent children were executed. However, even that comparison is not fair. In Nazi Germany, the government-sponsored genocide resulted in the systematic murder of more than 6 million Jews. It is so different than anything related to the gun safety debate that the NRA's use of imagery from that dark era should be dismissed as fear-mongering rhetoric. As Americans, we should not tolerate the politics of fear. Instead, we should focus on the fact that way too many children are dying. Shortly after 12/14, the date of the Sandy Hook mass shooting, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel wrote: Is there anything we can learn from this event? That all murder is evil but that of children is seven times seven more? That the ease of acquiring a weapon is no longer acceptable. If this tragedy does not produce universal gun control, what can and what will?"
330811431,2013-07-31 08:00:00,Senate confirms ATF director,http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senate-confirms-atf-director/2013/07/31/dc9b0644-fa09-11e2-8752-b41d7ed1f685_story.html,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,lobbying and lobbyists,appointments and executive changes,gun control,firearms",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"The Senate on Wednesday confirmed a director to head the agency that regulates firearms and investigates gun and explosives crimes, ending an extraordinary seven-year run in which the agency has been without a permanent, full-time leader. By confirming B. Todd Jones, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota and the acting part-time director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives by a vote of 53 to 42, Congress provided the Obama administration with a rare victory in its efforts to advance sweeping gun proposals. None of President Obama’s other legislative initiatives survived the congressional debate that followed the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December. The National Rifle Association has effectively blocked past nominees to head ATF. But NRA lobbyist Jim Baker said this week that the organization was not going to take a position on Jones and was not using the vote on his nomination to “score” senators, as the organization does with some other votes. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the group that represents firearms manufacturers, also threw its support behind Jones this week. “While we have at times strongly disagreed with the policy and regulatory positions and interpretations ATF has taken during Mr. Jones’ tenure as acting director, we have never found Mr. Jones himself to be disagreeable,” the NSSF’s general counsel, Lawrence Keane, wrote in a letter Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky). “Under Mr. Jones’ leadership, ATF has always listened to our concerns and issues with an open mind.” Obama, in a statement issued Wednesday night, said Senate Republicans had refused to confirm an ATF director before “because they put politics ahead of the agency’s law enforcement mission,” and applauded a bipartisan group of senators “who broke through that gridlock to give Todd Jones the up or down vote he deserved.” The confirmation vote came after a months-long debate over the nomination of Jones, a federal prosecutor and former Marine who was appointed to head ATF in September 2011, after the agency was rocked by controversy over the “Fast and Furious” gun-trafficking operation. It also turned into a political cliffhanger. The Senate had to keep open a procedural vote for nearly four hours until one member returned from out of state to cast her vote in favor of closing debate on the nomination. Without the appearance by Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Democrats would have been one vote short of the 60 needed to prevent a Republican filibuster. The ATF has been without a full-time director since 2006, when the NRA lobbied Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis), then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to insert a provision into the Patriot Act reauthoization to changed the position of ATF director from one appointed by the administration to one confirmed by the Senate. Michael J. Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney in Boston, was nominated by President George W. Bush to head ATF. He was blocked by three senators who accused ATF of being hostile to gun dealers. In his first term, Obama nominated Andrew Travers, who headed ATF’s Chicago field office, but after the NRA vowed to fight the nomination, it went nowhere. The Senate vote to end the debate on Jones began about 2 p.m. Wednesday. A critical vote was made by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) who switched her vote to end the debate from no to yes after an extended period of discussion on the floor of the Senate with a bipartisan group of Senate Judiciary Committee members. Her switch gave the Senate 59 of the 60 votes needed to end debate. But it wasn’t until about 7 p.m. that Heitkamp cast her vote to prevent a Republican filibuster and allow a confirmation vote. A spokesman for Heitkamp said she hadn’t been able to return earlier from North Dakota because she was sick. Once Heitkamp voted to end debate, the Senate moved to get a simple majority vote to confirm Jones, which they finally did by a roll call that ended at 7:35 p.m. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) called the vote “totally irresponsible,” citing an open complaint against Jones for alleged whistleblower retaliation in his position as U.S. attorney for Minnesota. “It’s too bad that after the Obama administration left the position open for more than four years, a person who is alleged to have retaliated against a whistleblower is now the director of an agency that could use a lot more whistleblowers to help clean it up,” Grassley said in a statement. Former astronaut Mark Kelly, who founded Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, ex-congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), praised the vote, saying, “It took seven years — and a little drama on the Senate floor today — but in the end, the Senate listened to the American people over the gun lobby.” Paul Kane contributed to this report.

1061469408,2013-07-19 10:34:18,Aurora Remembrance To Be Protested By Gun Supporters Called The 'Westboro Baptist Church Of Gun Groups',https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aurora-memorial_us_5be268b6e4b03708a481806e,en,False,murders and attempted murders,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost Survivors of the Aurora theater massacre and families of victims have planned a memorial event around noon on Friday -- an event that has turned into a dual rally for gun control and gun rights. Beginning Friday afternoon, to mark the one-year anniversary of the Aurora theater mass shooting that killed 12 people and injured another 70, the names of Aurora shooting victims -- as well the names of thousands of other victims of gun violence -- will be read in memorial to them. The reading will continue until 12:38 a.m. on Saturday, July 20, the exact time that the Aurora shooting began in 2012, when the group will hold a moment of silence for the victims and their families. The remembrance will be joined by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a gun control group co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, as well as several Newtown families and gun violence prevention advocates. The event is part of Mayors Against Illegal Guns ""No More Names"" bus tour to reduce gun violence. “I will forever live with the immense grief that comes with losing a child,” said Tom Sullivan, whose 27-year-old son Alex was killed in the Aurora theater shooting. “Too many people had to bury their loved ones after the massacre in Aurora, and too many Americans continue to see the tragic toll of gun violence each and every day in this country. As we remember my son and the victims of Aurora today, I hope our nation will take meaningful action to protect our families by keeping guns out of the wrong hands – so no more fathers have to experience this anguish.” But the victims, their families and the members of Mayors Against Illegal Guns will also be joined by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a pro-gun group that will be holding a protest for gun rights during the Aurora memorial. Both the memorial and the protest are scheduled to begin at noon on Friday. The Associated Press reports that both groups were issued permits for locations at Cherry Creek State Park that are within sight of each other. Dudley Brown, executive director of RMGO, says that the fact that the memorial was organized by Mayors Against Illegal Guns makes it political, not simply a remembrance. ""This is a quick reaction to a political event,"" said Brown to 7News. ""(With) Mayors Against Guns involved, means we have to be involved. If they're going to come with their message of a reduction of freedoms, regulation of a right, we have to present the other side,"" said Brown. State Rep. Rhonda Fields called the protest by RMGO a ""slap in the face of the people who are suffering the loss of a loved one."" Rep. Fields' district includes the Aurora theater where the mass shooting took place in 2012. Fields also backed a package of gun control bills that were signed into law by Gov. John Hickenlooper earlier this year, including universal background checks and a 15-round limit to ammo magazines. In 2005, Fields' son was shot and killed to keep him from testifying in a murder trial. Some have compared RMGO's protest actions in support of the 2nd Amendment to that of Westboro Baptist Church, a group that often protests funerals to spread their message of opposition to LGBT rights. Laura Chapin, a Denver-area consultant who works with gun control groups and other progressive causes, told KDVR in no uncertain terms: ""RMGO is the Westboro Baptist Church of gun groups."" More on Brown and Mayor Against Illegal Guns' sparring and opposing points of view on the remembrance, via The AP: Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, denied his group was being insensitive and said his members would be respectful. He accused Mayors Against Illegal Guns and its founder, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, of politicizing the Aurora massacre to promote gun control. ""Mayor Bloomberg is using this tragedy and walking all over graves to get to the microphone,"" Brown said. Bloomberg's organization respects the gun group's constitutional rights to protest and to own firearms, spokesman Kelly Steele said. ""But this is a memorial for Americans murdered with guns, not a pep rally,"" Steele said. ""Their rights aren't in question, but their judgment certainly is."" Brown said other memorials to the Aurora victims have been ""wholly appropriate"" and his group didn't stage simultaneous rallies. ""But when Mayors Against (Illegal) Guns had decided to dive in and make this a political issue, which they have since the beginning, we decided to dive in,"" he said. Brown declined to say whether his group's rally would include speakers but added, ""I have no intention to get in a shouting match."" On its website, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners calls itself ""Colorado's only no-compromise gun rights organization."" Brown declined to say how many members it has. The remembrance is slated to begin at noon with some remarks and then the victim names reading will begin. Stephen Barton, a survivor of the Aurora shooting, and Tom Sullivan, father of 27-year-old Alex Sullivan who was killed during the Aurora shooting, are expected to be in attendance. Aurora-area faith leaders and family members of victims from the Newtown, Conn. shooting will join Barton and Sullivan as well as Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

1083829409,2013-07-09 00:00:00,"Army Kills 51, Deepening Crisis in Egypt - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/middleeast/egypt.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp&,en,False,"politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,police,international relations,demonstrations and riots",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By David D. Kirkpatrick and Kareem Fahim CAIRO — The mass shooting of Islamist protesters by security forces on Monday at a sit-in for Mohamed Morsi, the ousted president, injected new outrage into the standoff over his removal by Egypt’s top generals, darkening hopes that they might reconcile the polarizing forces that have torn at the fabric of the country. It was by far the deadliest day of violence since the revolt that overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011. Within a few hours around dawn, advancing soldiers and police officers killed at least 51 civilians and wounded more than 400, almost all hit by gunfire, health officials said. Army and police spokesmen said that one soldier and two policemen had also been killed. But according to witnesses and video footage, one of the policemen appeared to have been shot by soldiers, and the military provided little evidence to back its claim that the fighting had been instigated by the Islamists. The scale and nature of the killings drove a deeper wedge between Mr. Morsi’s Islamist backers and their opponents, and diminished the chances that his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood might soon be coaxed back into a political process that they deem illegitimate after the military overthrew the elected president. At the same time, the bloodshed sharpened a fierce debate about whether the new military-led interim government that replaced Mr. Morsi last week was moving toward a democracy or away from it. Two and a half years after the overthrow of Mr. Mubarak, the institutions, tactics and dynamics of the decades-old secular-authoritarian government seemed, at least for the moment, to snap back into place. Some who vehemently denounced Mr. Mubarak’s use of brute force to silence critics were far more tepid about criticizing the killings of Mr. Morsi’s supporters, calling only for an inquiry to determine the root cause. The United States, which has conspicuously not condemned Mr. Morsi’s ouster, was also mild, calling on security forces to exercise restraint. “Violence begets violence and should be strongly condemned,” Mohamed ElBaradei, the former diplomat and liberal leader, said in a statement on Twitter. “Independent investigation is a must.” By contrast, Essam el-Erian, a senior Brotherhood leader, called the killings “an outright massacre” by “a fascist coup government.” Leaders of the Brotherhood, Egypt’s largest Islamist group and best-organized political force, said the generals had now shown their authoritarian colors, using lethal weapons to crush dissent while holding the freely elected president captive. They called for a national “uprising” against the return of a military dictatorship. Al Nour, the only Islamist party that had backed the military’s takeover, suspended its participation in the interim government, accelerating the disintegration of Egyptian politics toward a culture war between Islamists and their foes. The armed forces, on the other hand, claimed that Mr. Morsi’s supporters had attacked them first with rocks, gunfire and army-issued tear gas bombs, though dozens of witnesses — including some of Mr. Morsi’s opponents — disputed that account. At a news conference, Ahmed Ali, a military spokesman, said the security forces had responded with rubber bullets and gas bombs after coming under attack by heavy gunfire. He addressed a pointed question about human rights to Western critics: “What human rights are there for an armed person who terrorizes citizens and attacks military establishments?” The police, who had never fully accepted Mr. Morsi’s authority, reveled in the day and sought to revise history: a spokesman contended that the Muslim Brotherhood — and not the police — had been responsible for killing protesters during the revolt against Mr. Mubarak. “Policemen never thought that history would speak so quickly to prove the complete innocence of the policemen in the events of the January 2011 revolution,” said the spokesman, Hany Abdel Lateef. Some also suggested that Mr. Morsi’s supporters might be to blame for the fighting. “We expect violent actions from the side of the Muslim Brotherhood, and we cannot accept that armed gatherings be labeled as peaceful protests or sit-ins,” Khalid Talima, a representative of the coalition formed around the anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster, said at a news conference under the banner “Muslim Brotherhood-American conspiracy against the revolution.” Seeking to capitalize on the killing to rally supporters, the Muslim Brotherhood claimed that the soldiers had killed women and children. But hospitals and morgues reported no such casualties. The violence began around 4 a.m., as hundreds of Islamists were observing dawn prayers at a vigil for Mr. Morsi outside the presidential guard facility where he was believed to be detained. What set off the violence could not be determined. In addition to the official statements from the army and the police, one neighbor cited by The Associated Press said in an account posted online that she had run to a window when she heard gunfire and had seen men shooting at security forces from a mosque roof. But that neighbor, identified as Mirna al-Hikbawy, wrote that she had not seen the start of the fighting. Others, including both supporters and opponents of Mr. Morsi, said the military and the police had fired with little or no provocation, unloading tear gas, birdshot and bullets. “They opened fire on us while we were praying,” Moataz Abu al-Shakra, a 25-year-old electrical engineer, said, huddled behind a sheet of corrugated metal that Mr. Morsi’s supporters had sought to use as a shield. The metal was riddled with bullet holes, and he pointed to two pools of blood on the ground. “It is like they were fighting a war between two countries, not like our army or police,” he said. “They are criminals.”  10 Photos View Slide Show › Sit-in participants said gunmen had fired on them from atop the military buildings surrounding their camp. Video footage captured by the Islamists showed a soldier firing down from a roof while another calmly filmed the mayhem below. Sandbagged gun turrets were still visible hours later on some rooftops, and the angles of scores of bullet holes in cars, lampposts and the Islamists’ makeshift metal barriers indicated that gunfire hit at an angle from above. Many witnesses said the fighting lasted for hours, with hundreds of heavily armed soldiers chasing mostly unarmed protesters through the streets for blocks while continuing to shoot. Bullet holes, bullet casings and pools of blood dotted the ground hundreds of yards from the presidential guardhouse where the fighting had begun. The pro-Morsi demonstrators attempted to fight back by throwing rocks, and they tried to build barricades against the bullets. Two witnesses said they had seen at least two of Mr. Morsi’s supporters armed with what the witnesses described as primitive shotguns. Egyptian state television showed footage of what it described as a pro-Morsi fighter firing a primitive shotgun at advancing soldiers about 250 yards from the initial shooting. In another video clip on state television, a man in a black mask was seen walking with a similar weapon. Many of the videos were set in broad daylight. Ibrahim el-Sheikh, a neighbor and a relative of a New York Times employee in Cairo, said that one of the police officers, Mohamed el-Mesairy — cited by the police spokesman as a “martyr” — appeared to have been killed by the advancing soldiers. Mr. Mesairy was a familiar neighborhood policeman who had sought to hide in his parked car as Mr. Morsi’s supporters fled past, according to Mr. Sheikh and video footage he captured from his window. The video showed the gunfire of the advancing police and soldiers hitting the side of the car, and the bullet holes were visible hours later. Mr. Sheikh, who signed a petition and joined protests for Mr. Morsi’s ouster, said he and others carried the officer’s body from his car. “He did not have a head anymore,” he said. Gomaa Gaber, a 53-year-old mechanic with a bloodstained shirt, said he threw himself onto a younger relative, Ali Mohamed Said, 24, to protect him. But Mr. Said had already been shot in the chest. “He died in my arms,” Mr. Gaber said. At the Nasr City hospital, a few minutes’ drive from the initial shooting, Dr. Bassem al-Sayed, a surgeon, said he had seen a similar scene only once before, around Jan. 25, 2011, when Egyptians began their revolt against President Mubarak. “This is worse,” he said. At the news conference, the military spokesman showed video footage of handguns, tear gas grenades and bottles of whiskey he said the soldiers had found in the Islamists’ tents. As the conference began, a crowd of Egyptian journalists demanded that a television crew from Al Jazeera leave. Most Egyptian journalists in both the state and private media believe that Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab network owned by the government of Qatar, sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood. “We are in Egypt, the country of democracy,” Mr. Abdel Lateef, the police spokesman, said to raucous cheers as the crew left. Mr. Ali, the military spokesman, raised alarms about the Arab Spring itself — heresy here just a few months ago. He called Islamist charges the military had massacred demonstrators a new kind of “information warfare” that “runs through the Middle East region and we see since the breaking of the Arab Spring revolutions.” “They’re all wars against the state by its own citizens,” he said, “and the main weapon in these wars is the circulation of strife, rumors and lies.” Advertisement"

When Jill Schaller returned from a vacation she took earlier this month, her 19-year-old son ran out of her home carrying a gun he bought from Reno Police Sgt. Laura Conklin. Conklin sold the gun without a background check because it was a private party sale. Schaller called 911 on July 7, and Washoe County Deputy John Graves responded. He told her that her son’s purchase was perfectly legal. Graves wrote in his police report that the man deserved a chance to prove to his parents that he is “a responsible gun owner.” However, the 19 year old was prohibited from possessing a firearm after a judge ruled his mental illness made him unable to care for himself. Jill and Richard Schaller’s son has Asperger’s syndrome and was previously hospitalized for making suicidal threats. ""Due to these factors, Jill said she and Richard were granted continuing guardianship over him past the age of 18 by a Nevada court judge,"" Graves wrote in his report, noting the parents ""were both extremely worried about [their son] either harming himself or possibly others as they indicated in the past he has shown signs of being homicidal, but they did not elaborate on those signs."" Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong admitted that Graves should have recognized that Schaller’s son should not have been allowed to have the gun and should have seized the weapon. Furlong said ""bells should have gone off"" given what Graves learned from the Schallers and ""that should have been his signal"" to look into the situation more fully and surmise whether the man was qualified to own a gun. ""[Graves] should have taken the safe route and told the family, 'We're going to hold on to the gun overnight and sort this all out,'"" Furlong said. It was difficult for the Schaller’s to convince their son he could not own a gun. ""It took us like four or five days showing him the statute,” Jill Schaller said. She claims what Graves did only made matters worse. ""That made it more confusing for [our son] because all of them were just saying, 'Sorry, your mom and dad said no,' instead of saying it was illegal,"" she said. She believes that if Graves had told the young man that he can't have a gun by law, ""he would have listened to them — they were people of authority,"" she said. While an investigation into Graves’ action is underway, Sheriff Michael Haley said he cannot comment on the matter. He did say that officers are trained to recognize the types of people who are not qualified to own a gun. Furlong oversaw law enforcement’s response to a mass shooting by a mentally ill gunman at a Carson City IHOP restaurant in 2011. He said in the Schaller’s case, law enforcement is lucky no one got hurt. ""It just highlights the need for law enforcement and mental health to work more closely together,"" Furlong said. ""Just because a person has a mental illness does not mean he is a bad person. But they do have the probability of having an episode, and if there's a gun involved, it's a recipe for disaster.""

1244413365,2013-07-27 08:41:22,Gunman among 7 dead after Fla. hostage standoff,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomNation-TopStories/~3/M--0Hx5BqOI/,en,False,"murders and attempted murders,hostages",4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"A hostage situation and mass shooting that ended with seven people dead in the South Florida town of Hialeah began when an elderly couple who managed the apartment complex left the granddaughter they were watching and went to talk to a tenant living with his mother, according to reports. That act led to a barrage of gunfire that killed the couple, a man walking his children home and three other people apparently going about their business Friday night, according to police. The incident ended when a SWAT team stormed the apartment early Saturday where two hostages were being held by a man suspected of shooting six people. Police identified the suspect as Pedro Alberto Vargas, 42. Vargas, who has no known criminal record, set a combustible liquid on fire in his fourth-floor apartment, according to the Associate Press. Building manager Italo Pisciotti, 79, and his wife, Camira Pisciotti, 69, saw smoke and ran to the unit, Lt. Carl Zogby, a spokesman with the Hialeah Police Department told the AP. When the couple arrived, Vargas opened the door and fired 15 to 20 shots, killing both. Shamira Pisciotti, the couple's daughter, told the Miami Herald that her mother appeared to have died instantly but not her dad. ""It looks like my dad was still alive after he was shot,"" she said. Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez told the AP that police got a call around 6:30 p.m. Friday that shots had been fired in a building with dozens of apartments in Hialeah, just a few miles north of Miami. After gunning down the building managers, Vargas went back into his burning apartment and fired 10 to 20 shots from a 9mm pistol into the street. One of the bullets struck 33-year-old Carlos Javier Gavilanes, who was parking his car after returning home from work. Zogby told the AP his body was found next to his vehicle. The gunman then kicked his way into a third-floor apartment, where he shot to a man, his wife and their daughter. Agustin Hernandez and Alberto Martinez told NBC 6 TV that those three victims were their sister-in-law Palis Merlis Niebles, her husband, Patricio, and her teenage daughter Priscilla Perez. Patricio worked as a handyman at the apartment complex, and Niebles was a sister of their wives, Hernandez and Martinez said. The Pisciottis were Colombian immigrants who managed the building for 20 years and would have celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary in August, the Miami Herald reported. They were watching their 9-year-old granddaughter at the time of the shooting, the girl's father, Carlos Almandoz, told the paper. ""They were terrific grandparents,"" Almandoz said. ""They had an excellent relationship with my children. They took care of them while we worked."" Rodriguez said that when police arrived, they discovered an active shooter situation: ""He's inside the building, moving from floor to floor. Eventually he barricades himself in an apartment."" A crisis team was able to briefly establish communication with the man. Rodriguez said negotiators and a SWAT team tried talking with him from the other side of the door of an apartment unit where he was holding two hostages. But Rodriguez said the talks eventually ""just fell apart."" Officers stormed the building, fatally shooting the man in an exchange of gunfire. ""They made the decision to go in there and save and rescue the hostages,"" Rodriguez said. The hostages, identified as Zoeb and Sarrida Nek, were shaken up but not hurt. Rodriguez said he didn't have any information on how long negotiations lasted. He said police discovered two people, one male and one female, shot to death in the hallway in front of one unit. Three more, a male and two females, were found shot and killed in another apartment on a different floor. Another man who was walking his children into an apartment across the street also was killed. Rodriguez said it wasn't immediately clear whether the gunman took aim at him from an upper-level balcony or if he was hit by a stray bullet. ""From up there, he was able to shoot at people across the street, catching this one man who was just walking into his apartment,"" Rodriguez said. All six people were killed in a short time span, Zogby told the AP, and it's possible they were all dead by the time police arrived. Miriam Valdes, 70, was in a friend's apartment two doors down. She said she heard officers trying to convince Vargas to surrender. ""Pedro let these people out,"" Valdes said officers told him. ""We're going to help you."" She said the gunman first asked for his girlfriend and then his mother but refused to cooperate. Police and neighbors described Vargas as a quiet man who had only recently moved into the building. However, some tenants said Vargas was abusive and had few friends. ""The crime scene is the whole building,"" Zogby told the AP. ""He was ready to fight."" Contributing: The Associated Press"

A colleague in Colorado had shipped him a crackling recording of 911 calls from the Aurora cinema shootings that summer. Walls, who runs the emergency department at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, listened in astonishment at the escalating alarm. “We got another person outside shot in the leg, a female,’’ reports a police officer who was among the first on the scene. “I got people running out of the theater that are shot.’’ Another shouts: “Do I have permission to start taking some of these victims via car? I have a whole bunch of people shot out here and no rescue.’’ Advertisement “Just notify all the hospitals that we got people coming in,’’ someone commands. Dr. Richard Zane had also sent a timeline of the bloodied victims who had arrived in his emergency department at University of Colorado Hospital starting at 1 a.m. “I counted the arrivals,’’ Walls said. Twenty-three in an hour. “I was worried. We had done a lot of drills at the Brigham. But I couldn’t remember ever doing a drill with that many patients. The kind of [patients] who need immediate attention.’’ That e-mail from Zane, a former Brigham physician and emergency department leader, was a red flag for the hospital. Lessons from the mass shooting in Colorado that killed 12 people and injured 58 others played a key role in preparing the Brigham to treat the onslaught of victims injured in the Boston Marathon bombing. Coincidentally, 23 arrived in the first hour. The Brigham and other hospitals in Boston and across the country have put staff through dozens of emergency drills since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, simulating airplane crashes, fast-spreading viruses, and terrorist bombings. But as time passed, the intensity of preparations at some institutions naturally waned, said Dr. Kristi Koenig, a professor at UC Irvine in California and coauthor of a textbook on disaster medicine. Advertisement It can take another crisis to shake up things, she said. Massachusetts General Hospital had a similar turning point a number of years ago, when an Israeli medical team visited the hospital. “We thought, ‘We’re not even geared up,’ ’’ said Dr. Alasdair Conn, head of emergency medicine there. “They said you need to have an experienced doctor look at every ambulance that comes in the parking lot, saying who is the sickest.’’ The Aurora timeline led Walls and several colleagues to analyze and strengthen the Brigham’s emergency response plan. “I was worried we might be getting complacent,’’ he said. “We needed to reenergize.’’ The Brigham had new leadership, and those executives and caregivers were trained and others were retrained to fill various roles during a disaster, such as incident commander and public information officer. Walls realized the hospital would need more resuscitation teams if they received as many victims as the Colorado hospital did after the Aurora shooting. The new plan called for 12 to 15 teams of doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians, rather than four or five. And they prepared themselves psychologically to triage large numbers of patients. In the minutes after the Marathon bombings, a patient came into the emergency room who had penetrating shrapnel wounds that required surgery, said Dr. Michael Zinner, chairman of surgery. But the patient was awake and stable. Doctors decided to wait. Advertisement “We didn’t know if someone worse was going to come through the door,’’ Zinner said. “Someone bleeding to death and with a leg blown off. We did have patients like that. What we learned from Aurora was how to triage and set priorities. And that made a difference.’’ Liz Kowalczyk can be reached at kowalczyk@globe.com.

Beginning Friday afternoon, to mark the one-year anniversary of the Aurora theater mass shooting that killed 12 people and injured another 70, the names of Aurora shooting victims -- as well the names of thousands of other victims of gun violence -- will be read in memorial to them. The reading will continue until 12:38 a.m. on Saturday, July 20, the exact time that the Aurora shooting began in 2012, when the group will hold a moment of silence for the victims and their families. The remembrance will be joined by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a gun control group co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, as well as several Newtown families and gun violence prevention advocates. The event is part of Mayors Against Illegal Guns ""No More Names"" bus tour to reduce gun violence. “I will forever live with the immense grief that comes with losing a child,” said Tom Sullivan, whose 27-year-old son Alex was killed in the Aurora theater shooting. “Too many people had to bury their loved ones after the massacre in Aurora, and too many Americans continue to see the tragic toll of gun violence each and every day in this country. As we remember my son and the victims of Aurora today, I hope our nation will take meaningful action to protect our families by keeping guns out of the wrong hands – so no more fathers have to experience this anguish.” But the victims, their families and the members of Mayors Against Illegal Guns will also be joined by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a pro-gun group that will be holding a protest for gun rights during the Aurora memorial. Both the memorial and the protest are scheduled to begin at noon on Friday. The Associated Press reports that both groups were issued permits for locations at Cherry Creek State Park that are within sight of each other. Dudley Brown, executive director of RMGO, says that the fact that the memorial was organized by Mayors Against Illegal Guns makes it political, not simply a remembrance. ""This is a quick reaction to a political event,"" said Brown to 7News. ""(With) Mayors Against Guns involved, means we have to be involved. If they're going to come with their message of a reduction of freedoms, regulation of a right, we have to present the other side,"" said Brown. State Rep. Rhonda Fields called the protest by RMGO a ""slap in the face of the people who are suffering the loss of a loved one."" Rep. Fields' district includes the Aurora theater where the mass shooting took place in 2012. Fields also backed a package of gun control bills that were signed into law by Gov. John Hickenlooper earlier this year, including universal background checks and a 15-round limit to ammo magazines. In 2005, Fields' son was shot and killed to keep him from testifying in a murder trial. Some have compared RMGO's protest actions in support of the 2nd Amendment to that of Westboro Baptist Church, a group that often protests funerals to spread their message of opposition to LGBT rights.

Bloomberg's organization respects the gun group's constitutional rights to protest and to own firearms, spokesman Kelly Steele said. ""But this is a memorial for Americans murdered with guns, not a pep rally,"" Steele said. ""Their rights aren't in question, but their judgment certainly is."" Brown said other memorials to the Aurora victims have been ""wholly appropriate"" and his group didn't stage simultaneous rallies. ""But when Mayors Against (Illegal) Guns had decided to dive in and make this a political issue, which they have since the beginning, we decided to dive in,"" he said. Brown declined to say whether his group's rally would include speakers but added, ""I have no intention to get in a shouting match."" On its website, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners calls itself ""Colorado's only no-compromise gun rights organization."" Brown declined to say how many members it has. The remembrance is slated to begin at noon with some remarks and then the victim names reading will begin. Stephen Barton, a survivor of the Aurora shooting, and Tom Sullivan, father of 27-year-old Alex Sullivan who was killed during the Aurora shooting, are expected to be in attendance. Aurora-area faith leaders and family members of victims from the Newtown, Conn. shooting will join Barton and Sullivan as well as Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

A gathering of people from all around our country with one thing in common: a desire to stop the gun violence that plagues their lives and continues to plague our nation. Marking the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting in a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, young Sikhs of Oak Creek organized a candlelight vigil against gun violence at the same gurdwara where six people were murdered. One would anticipate the one-year anniversary vigil to be small and somber. Most people I meet know Aurora and Newtown but draw a blank when they hear Oak Creek. It simply blurs into the string of horrific mass shootings last year that each time failed to yield the solutions to gun violence that we were desperate for. And yet, more than 1,000 people of all faiths and backgrounds gathered in Wisconsin for the vigil with many more watching online. Holding candles and wearing scarves and turbans in solidarity, they listened to survivor stories of Oak Creek and other national tragedies, from Virginia Tech to Newtown. Rather than a solemn affair, the Sikh Americans of Oak Creek interwove tearful testimonies with multifaith prayer and music, stories and songs that repeatedly lifted up the Sikh spirit of ""Chardi Kala,"" everlasting optimism and high spirits even in hardship and suffering. The Oak Creek mass shooting was a national tragedy. It was the biggest act of violence against a faith community since the 1963 Alabama church bombings. But it is also a story of how a community got up from being floored and organized for concrete social and political change. In a time when many who want gun violence prevention legislation are frustrated and tempted to give up, Oak Creek offers hope and inspiration. Immediately after the mass shooting, the Sikh community rightly understood the Oak Creek tragedy was part of a history of discrimination on the basis of race and religion. Sikhs in Oak Creek joined civil rights groups and allies in a national grassroots campaign calling for the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs and others vulnerable to violence. Their work resulted in a historic Senate hearing on the rise of domestic terrorism and hate crimes in America. On September 19, 2012, Harpreet Singh Saini, a teenager whose mother was gunned down in the prayer hall, became the first Sikh in U.S. history to testify before Congress. ""I want to protect other people from what happened to my mother,"" Harpreet said. ""I want to combat hate, not just against Sikhs but against all people. Senators, I know what happened at Oak Creek was not an isolated incident. I fear it may happen again if we don't stand up and do something."" Harpreet asked the government to give his mother the dignity of being counted in hate crimes statistics. On Friday, after a year of concerted organizing, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice will finally begin to track hate crimes against Sikh Americans, Hindus, Arabs, Buddhists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Orthodox Christians. They will be counted on the Hate Crime Incident Report form for the first time. Although adding categories to an incident report might seem like a minor improvement, it is not. It's impossible to combat the problem of hate-based violence in America without acknowledging that it exists. The policy change is an important crime-fighting tool and a civil rights victory for a community that has suffered discrimination, especially since 9/11. Quick action that galvanized Oak Creek in the wake of tragedy helped get this done. But it was also the result of more than a decade of sustained effort by determined community advocates, such as the Sikh Coalition, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund and South Asian Americans Leading Together. Now, some Sikh Americans are joining the movement against gun violence for the first time.  Amardeep Singh Kaleka, whose father Satwant Singh Kaleka was killed fighting the gunman in the shooting, has become a prominent voice against gun violence.

The ceremony began and ended with a reading of the names of people murdered by guns -- a school in Newtown, a theater in Aurora, the streets of Chicago and daily homicides that barely make headlines. Between stories of victims, the drums of Native American tribes flowed into Sikh prayers and the voices of a children's choir. The vigil also featured an array of representatives from some 45 groups who worked with Sikhs since the tragedy, including Groundswell at Auburn Seminary, a multifaith social action network of 100,000 people of faith I helped found. The movement against gun violence has not fizzled out. Even in the midst of the distractions of the next day's news cycle, we must remain focused in the pursuit of solutions that make our streets and schools, homes and houses of worship, safer for all. Young Sikh Americans are among the many new voices that can re-energize  the movement.

Nidal Hasan to death Wednesday for killing 13 soldiers in a 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas. The 13-member panel heard 45 minutes of emotional closing arguments from the government before beginning its deliberations earlier Wednesday afternoon. More from GlobalPost: Fort Hood shooter guilty of murder, jury to weigh death penalty Hasan, who has represented himself throughout the proceedings, had no closing statement. He also had no visible reaction when the verdict was read, staring first at the jury forewoman and then the judge. The Virginia-born Muslim has admitted to the massacre from the start, telling jurors ""I am the shooter"" during opening arguments and asking for the death penalty so he could become a martyr. He claimed he carried out the shooting to defend members of the Taliban from an “illegal war.” Prosecutors said Hasan targeted ""those wearing the uniform"" during his rampage because he did not want to be deployed. More from GlobalPost: Hasan tells Fort Hood jurors: 'I am the shooter' (VIDEO) They claimed he methodically prepared for the attack by practicing at a local shooting range, making frequent visits to a gun store to stock up on ammunition and studying the schedule of the building he carried out the shooting in. The mass shooting on Nov. 5, 2009, shocked the nation. Dressed in fatigues, Hassan shouted “Allahu akbar” (“God is great” in Arabic) before opening fire inside a crowded waiting room where soldiers were completing medical tests before deploying overseas.

That he would be convicted in the killings was rarely in doubt in the four years since he began shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. But 13 high-ranking military officers will return Monday to debate the issue survivors and victims’ families have waited all this time to learn: if Hasan will receive the death penalty for his crimes, the Associated Press said. Hasan admitted to the shooting, claiming he carried it out to defend members of the Taliban from an “illegal war.” He represented himself during the court-martial and had asked for the death penalty so he could become a martyr.

Hasan never called any witnesses in his defense proceedings, and didn’t take the stand himself. “There is no doubt, as I said in the beginning, the accused is the shooter,” prosecutor Col. Steven Henricks told the jury, according to CNN. “The only question for you is ... is this a premeditated design to kill?” When the jury returns to court on Monday, it will offer recommendations to the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, Reuters reported. The decision to kill Hasan by lethal injection is hers alone. Want a seat at the table?

This version has been corrected.. “Doesn’t anyone have any shame any more?” is a comment heard quite a bit these days. Except it’s usually reserved for politicians with unseemly sexual pasts (or presents) hubristically seeking — or insisting on holding onto — office: Weiner, Spitzer, Filner. Or spoiled entertainers gone wild — Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Lindsay Lohan — who treat Malibu rehab, court appearances (while looking somber in chic duds), and endearing turns hosting TV talk shows as a revolving door of opportunity to just go out and do it again. But real shame-worthy behavior that has become fatalistically accepted is this: Acts of aggressive sadism toward parents of murdered children, trotted out as legitimate protests for constitutional rights. Sorry to narrow-cast here, but the prime repeat defender is the NRA and its splinter groups. Some examples: After Columbine, Tom Mauser, the father of murdered teen Daniel Mauser, walked, wearing Daniel’s shoes, to an NRA meeting to peacefully offer his and his son’s suggestions to close the loopholes in the Brady Bill so that guns wouldn’t fall in the wrong hands. (Sadly, and eerily, Mauser and his son had discussed doing this just before the mass shooting that claimed Daniel’s young life.) At that meeting,Tom Hauser was vehemently shouted at and threatened by NRA members. NRA vice president Wayne LaPierre’s horrible, tasteless statements after the unspeakable horror at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. (six- and seven-year-olds murdered; in our darkest moments, did any of us imagine that?) were typical blame-the-gun-control people. But it was the Internet targeting of a Sandy Hook victim’s father — his private financial records hacked and thrust online, his debt gleefully paraded — by the NRA that was especially sickening. More, the gesture seemed to borrow from the Saxby Chambliss-vs.-Max Cleland playbook: Turn things on their head. Go out of your way to find someone who has really suffered and – shamelessly — make that person the devil. (In 2002, when Republican Chambliss was running for his Georgia Senate seat against Democrat Cleland, who lost three limbs fighting in Vietnam, Chambliss equated Cleland with Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden and proudly defended the comparison, with Ann Coulter joining in to heap mockery on Cleland. Make those who suffered the most the bad guys and then go an extra mile to rub it in their faces. That’s the game. This happened last Friday in Newtown, but it happened so fast, it’s already out of the news. National gun rights people named Friday, Aug. 9, “Starbucks Appreciation Day.”  They did so not because they are latte-with-soy-milk aficionados or avid collectors of the vintage confessional soft rock music and the questing-internationalist and healing-oriented books the coffee chain used to feature at its point of purchase.  Rather, they did so because Starbucks – unlike, for example, Peet’s Coffee, Ikea, and California Pizza Kitchen — refuses to ban guns in its venues, preferring to hew to local policy. If a state or jurisdiction allows weapons, concealed or otherwise, to be carried into retail stores, the Starbucks franchises in that state will allow that, too. Even those of you who didn’t get wind of this fleetingly covered news story can guess the “Grandma, what sharp teeth you have …” hidden agenda – or, at the very least, sneaky opportunity — that “Starbucks Appreciation Day” was about. It was a chance for gun activists to come not just to any Starbucks but to the Newtown Starbucks, a mile and a half from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 26 people – the large majority very young children – were gunned to death eight months earlier. They came on Friday packing heat. Why? Why come brandishing guns to a pleasant little coffee-and-snack place where parents take their children after school? Was that so necessary? The act was – there is no other word for it – sadistic. “How can they even think of being here? It’s so disgusting and heartless! It’s so in-your-face!” said a local woman, Barbara Kraushaar, who was part of a counter-group of Newtown residents who came to meet the gun-toters in the parking lot told the New York Times. “Our community is still healing, and we find it reprehensible that they are picking Newtown to rally,” was the response from the Newtown Action Alliance, which is devoted to making sure that what happened there on Dec. 14 never happens again. To its credit, the Newtown Starbucks closed four hours early on Friday, so the gun activists couldn’t enter and make a scene. (The gun activists pronounced themselves angry at Starbucks for doing so.) Those in the community who have worked for healing were also appalled. With his wife and musical partner, Tina Weymouth, longtime Connecticut resident Chris Frantz, singer and musician of the fabled Talking Heads and the Tom Tom Club, last winter recorded a group of Newtown children singing “Over The Rainbow,” with all proceeds going to Sandy Hook victims. Frantz says, “It’s hard to imagine that Starbucks would permit gun toting in their stores,” Frantz told me via e-mail. “What come next? Starbucks Ammunition?” And Rabbi Herbert N. Brockman, of New Haven’s Congregation Mishkan Israel, who also teaches at Yale Divinity School, in an e-mail response says that the gun-toters who came to the Starbucks “should remember the Biblical-prophetic call to `beat your swords into plowshares and your spears into pruning hooks….’  It seems that for reasons unfathomable, perhaps nefarious, some choose to do the opposite: beat their plowshares into swords. It is a terrible human tragedy, for we have the moral compass to know what is right. When the NRA called to put more guns in schools, I suggested we put more teachers in gun stores. This madness has to stop.” Included is the “madness” of gun activists intentionally targeting the already victimized, and the most victimized of those victims — grieving families of gunned-down children. If we don’t call stunts like parading around Newtown’s Starbucks with pistols “shameless,” then what is shamefulness? And, whatever our views about Starbucks or responsible gun ownership, if we don’t call sadism sadism, then the behavior the Newtown Alliance calls “reprehensible” will just keep happening.

463376467,2013-08-20 21:33:35,FBI trains police in mass-shooting response,http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/FBI-trains-police-in-mass-shooting-response-4747796.php,en,True,,14,SF Chronicle,http://www.sfgate.com/,"Salisbury, Md. -- Two men stand anxiously at the classroom entrance and another lies seriously wounded beside a wall outside. ""Don't come down here, I'm telling you - I'll kill 'em,"" a man inside the classroom shouts to officers snaking down the corridor with guns drawn. The officers call out to the gunman, who demands money, and order the potential victims to get down as they approach the classroom to take out the shooter in a rapid firefight. The drill is part of a training program the FBI is helping run for local law enforcement agents nationwide. Acting on a White House directive after December's Connecticut school massacre, and partnering with a Texas training center, the FBI this year has been teaching best practices for responding to mass shootings. ""You don't need negotiators, you don't have time for SWAT teams, you need to get in there as fast as possible and stop the killing,"" said Chris Combs, who runs the FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Center, the headquarters command post for major emergencies, and is involved in running the program. The goal is to promote a standardized strategy as local police departments - invariably the first officers to arrive - respond to such shootings. Besides the tactical drills, conferences run by FBI field offices are intended to prepare local agencies for the challenges of an active shooter emergency and to let them know that federal help, including extra manpower to interview witnesses, collect evidence and manage a sprawling crime scene, is available to them. ""It's not capability - it's capacity,"" said Katherine Schweit, another FBI official involved in organizing the program. ""Every police department, sheriff's department has the ability to do interviews and to do evidence collection. ... But we can bring capacity. We can bring 100 agents to a scene in a day and do hundreds of interviews, and have done that time and time again."" Localized training programs have proliferated in recent years amid high-profile mass shootings in places such as Tucson, where then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was wounded by a lone gunman in 2011 while meeting with constituents, and in Aurora, Colo., where a man killed 12 in a movie theater. After the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, President Obama directed the FBI to train local law enforcement to develop a more consistent response and signed legislation formalizing the agency's authority to assist in mass-killing investigations. The FBI then partnered with an ""active shooter"" training center - ALERRT, or Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training - which was created in Texas after the 1999 Columbine High School shootings in Colorado and receives Justice Department funding. The two-day, 16-hour tactical session - like the one held on a college campus in Maryland last week - opens with classroom instruction and ends with role-playing drills."

I love you though, OK? And I'm proud of you. It's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life...[listening] No you don't want that, you're going to be OK...[listening] I thought the same thing.

466408848,2013-08-09 11:01:27,Gun Advocates Plan 'Appreciation Day' At Newtown Starbucks,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/09/gun-advocates-newtown-starbucks_n_3731542.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Deputy Director of News & Analytics, HuffPost Gun advocates are reportedly set to hold a ""Starbucks Appreciation Day"" at an establishment in Newtown, Conn., to celebrate the ability to carry weapons in the store. Gun control groups have vehemently criticized the event as ""reprehensible."" NBC affiliate WVIT reported that gun rights advocates are using Facebook to rally supporters to head to Starbucks stores across the nation Friday to celebrate the coffee chain's open policy on carrying weapons. The company doesn't prohibit customers from openly carrying guns in states where it is legal. The ""Starbucks appreciation day"" Facebook page says they want to thank Starbucks for standing up for the right to bear arms. One post by a Ridgefield, Conn., resident on the ""CT Open Carry"" page caught some attention. The resident said he and some members from the Connecticut Citizens Defense League were going to meet Friday evening at the Starbucks at 34 Church Hill Road in Newtown, the town where 26 people were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. (The Hartford Courant has a screengrab of the post, which appears to have been taken down.) The Newtown Action Alliance, a group set up in the wake of the Dec. 14 tragedy, responded by calling the plans ""reprehensible."" ""Our community is still healing and we find it reprehensible that they are picking Newtown to rally,"" David Ackert, a spokesman for the group, told WVIT. ""It is disturbing to think that tomorrow night you and your children may be sitting in Starbucks when people carrying guns walk through the door."" The group also posted a statement on its Facebook page Thursday: We wonder why it isn't okay to appreciate Starbucks at the same time appreciate the sensitive nature of the gesture in our neighborhood half a year after our community was ravaged by ‪#‎gunviolence‬. There are 5 other Starbucks locations within about 15 miles of ours to choose from. Starbucks spokesman Danny Cowan told Newtown Patch that the company does not endorse the event. ""Our stores are gathering places for the communities we serve,"" he said in a statement. ""We respect the diversity of our customers. We realize there are deep-standing passions on gun ownership. We abide by the laws that permit open carry. However, where those laws do not exist, open carry in Starbucks in prohibited ... We encourage both customers and advocacy groups on both sides to share their input with their public officials. We are extremely sensitive to the issue of gun violence in our society, and we believe by supporting local laws is the best way for us to provide a safe environment for both our partners and customers."" The local Starbucks store could not immediately be reached for comment. This is not the first time such a campaign has been planned. In February, more than 1,000 gun enthusiasts joined a Facebook event page for ""Gun Owners Support Starbucks"" Day. Advocacy group Moms Demand Action and others have asked Starbucks to change its policy and ban guns in all store locations. UPDATE: 12:35 p.m. -- Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, told The Huffington Post the CCDL had nothing to do with the organizing of Friday's event but added that the group supports members who choose to participate. He said he heard ""through the grapevine"" that a ""number of people... more than a few"" are planning to participate in the gathering at numerous locations across the nation. UPDATE: 6:22 p.m. -- Starbucks announced it decided to close its Newtown location early Friday. A statement reads: Dear Customers, At Starbucks we are proud that our stores serve as gathering places for thousands of communities across the country and we appreciate that our customers share diverse points of view on issues that matter to them. We also believe in being sensitive to each community we serve. Today, advocacy groups from different sides of the open carry debate announced plans to visit our Newtown, Connecticut store to bring attention to their points of view. We recognize that there is significant and genuine passion surrounding this topic, however out of respect for Newtown and everything the community has been through we decided to close our store early before the event started. Starbucks did not endorse or sponsor the event. We continue to encourage customers and advocacy groups from all sides of the debate to contact their elected officials, who make the open carry laws that our company follows. Our long-standing approach to this topic has been to comply with local laws and statutes in the communities we serve. Thank you for your understanding and respect for the Newtown community.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Accused Fort Hood shooter presenting effective defense? A jury is set to begin deliberating the fate of the soldier accused of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others at Fort Hood, Texas. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan is sending only a single piece of evidence to the jury room when deliberations likely start Thursday: an evaluation from his boss that called him a good soldier. By contrast, the U.S government has produced more than 700 pieces of evidence against Hasan, who hasn't put up a fight against charges that he committed the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. Among the evidence put forward for the prosecution: Pill bottles that rattle with bullets removed form soldiers. Photos of Hasan prowling the outside of a Fort Hood medical building with a gun during the time of the shooting. Jurors can even handle that gun, an FN 5.7 semi-automatic pistol, which Hasan volunteered belonged to him during the 12-day trial. Hasan rested his case Wednesday without calling any witnesses, but later told the judge that the attack was provoked because ""these were deploying soldiers who were going to engage in an illegal war."" Hasan is representing himself but told a military judge Wednesday that he wouldn't be calling any witnesses in his defense. The jury was dismissed after the prosecution asked for more time to prepare jury instructions and logistics before closing arguments. But after jurors were dismissed, Hasan told the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, that the jury shouldn't have the option of convicting him on the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. ""I would like to agree with the prosecution that it wasn't done under the heat of sudden passion,"" Hasan said. ""There was adequate provocation -- that these were deploying soldiers that were going to engage in an illegal war."" ""There's not a shred of evidence to suggest the accused was acting under a heat of passion as he was committing the single largest mass murder on a U.S. military installation ever,"" said Col. Steve Henricks, one of the military's prosecutors, had said earlier. Col. Tara Osborn asked prosecutors if they were ready to present closing arguments on Wednesday, but they said they would prefer to wait until Thursday. Hasan has sat mostly silent, raising few objections, declining to let military lawyers take over his defense and questioning only three of prosecutors' witnesses. Several of those witnesses were shot during the attack and recalled hearing a shout of ""Allahu Akbar!"" -- Arabic for ""God is great!"" -- inside a crowded medical building before Hasan opened fire using a laser-sighted handgun. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, suggested before trial that he wanted to argue that the killings were in defense of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, but that strategy was rejected by the judge. Since then, he has offered little for jurors to consider. In fact, during a brief opening statement, Hasan said evidence would show he was the shooter and called himself a soldier who had ""switched sides"" in a war. Suspicions about Hasan's defense strategy elevated as the trial dragged on, as he leaked documents to journalists revealing that he told military mental health workers after the attack that he could ""still be a martyr"" if convicted and executed by the government. Yet he never played the role of a high-threat, angry extremist in court. Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by Fort Hood police officers responding to the rampage, didn't get agitated in court or raise his voice. But that passive and muted presence convinced his court-ordered, standby attorneys that he was trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death. The attorneys had asked that their advisory roles be minimized, saying Hasan's defense strategy was ""repugnant,"" but the judge refused. Hasan began the trial signaling that he would call on just two people to testify -- one a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and the other a California professor of psychology and religion. What evidence the military has produced will be given to 13 high-ranking military officers during deliberations. Jurors must unanimously convict Hasan of multiple killings, and then unanimously vote to sentence him to death, for Hasan to be sent to death row.

Nidal Hasan's Fort Hood, Texas, court-martial Monday. Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder during a shooting rampage at the base in November 2009. 
Advertisement Presiding Judge Col. Tara Osborn ruled the presentations Hasan made while in medical residency and in fellowship years before the shooting were too far removed from the actual incident to be considered. ""It is too remote in time and too open to multiple interpretations,"" Osborn said of presentations Hasan made while at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Internet searches and more recent portions of Hasan's web history will be admissible, the judge ruled. She also ruled out any evidence framing the mass shooting as a ""copycat"" crime similar to that of former Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar's 2003 attack in Kuwait that killed two and wounded 14. Akbar is the last member of the Army to be sentenced to death, and was prosecuted by Col. Mike Mulligan, who is the lead prosecutor in the Hasan case, the Killeen, Texas, Daily Herald reported Monday.

Miraculously, no one was injured and Tuff is being hailed as a hero for possibly saving the lives of more than 800 students at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy. The suspect, later identified as 20-year-old Michael Brandon Hill, walked into the elementary school's office with an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, DeKalb County officials told the press Wednesday. ""[I saw] a young man ready to kill anybody that he could and take any lives he wanted to,"" Tuff told ABC. She asked the gunman his name in an attempt to keep him calm, but told ABC that at first he wouldn't tell her. ""He told me he was sorry for what he was doing. He was willing to die,"" Tuff said. She remembered him loading his gun in front of her and the rest of the staff. ""I just started telling him stories,"" she said, saying things like, ""You don't have to die today."" Tuff told him about the tragedies she had endured in her own life, like her divorce, and was eventually able to convince him to surrender to the police. ""I told him, 'OK, we all have situations in our lives,"" she said. ""It was going to be OK. If I could recover, he could, too."" The gunman's brother, Timothy Hill, told NBC News that Hill ""was bipolar and suffered from ADD."" Hill exchanged fire with police and took several school employees -- including Tuff -- hostage in the front office. According to AP, Hill has been charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. UPDATE Thursday, August 22: On a recording of a 911 call released Wednesday, bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff can be heard relaying messages from shooting suspect Michael Brandon Hill to DeKalb County emergency dispatchers before convincing him to surrender.

Nidal Hasan to death for the Fort Hood, Texas, mass shooting. The panel deliberated slightly more than two hours.
Advertisement Witnesses said Hasan showed no emotion when the sentence was handed down, NBC News reported. Hasan will be sent to the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., but an appeal is automatic under the military justice system, the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman said. If he is executed, he will be the first service member put to death under the military justice system in more than a half-century. The same panel of 13 Army officers, all senior to Hasan, convicted him Friday of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. The panel also ruled Hasan would lose his monthly salary of more than $7,200 a month, which he had continued to receive after the crime, as required by law. The newspaper said he won't officially lose his rank of major until he is dismissed from the Army. In closing arguments Wednesday morning, prosecutors asked the panel to give Hasan the death penalty.

This is not a charitable act; this is the cost of his murderous rampage. ""He is not now, and he never will be, a martyr. He is criminal. He is a cold-blooded murderer."" Hasan, an Army psychiatrist acting as his own lawyer, again offered no defense or explanation of his motive in his 2009 shooting rampage at a Fort Hood soldier deployment center. Hasan, who turns 43 Sept. 8, could become the first U.S. soldier in 52 years executed in the military's death chamber at Leavenworth.  All panel members had to agree on the death penalty, and President Obama still must approve it. Deliberations began shortly after 11 a.m., after the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, gave lengthy instructions on how to reach a punishment decision, the San Antonio Express-News reported. Tuesday Hasan asked no questions of prosecution witnesses -- including the spouses and parents of six murder victims -- who testified about their struggles since the shooting. The struggles they spoke about included alcohol abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts and unraveled relationships.

Nidal Hasan declined to present a defense Wednesday after prosecutors rested in his military trial for the 2009 Fort Hood massacre. After 11 days of testimony, the trial will now proceed to closing arguments, WFAA-TV, Dallas, reported.
Advertisement Hasan, 42, is representing himself against charges he killed 13 people and injured 32 others. Hasan had originally planned to call as his only defense witness Dr. Lewis Rambo, an expert on religious conversion from San Francisco Theological Seminary. After he changed his mind Tuesday, Judge Col. Tara Osborn still required Hasan to meet with him Tuesday night. If Hasan had testified, he would have been subject to cross-examination by prosecutors. Richard Rosen, a professor at the Texas Tech Center for Military Law, said Hasan could wait until sentencing to speak. If he testifies under oath, Hasan still would be subject to questioning by Army lawyers. He could give an unsworn statement but it could carry less weight with the trial panel. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said he was talking to Hasan about representing him during sentencing.
Advertisement He has said he walked into the medical deployment center on the Killeen, Texas, base on Nov. 5, 2009, to kill as many soldiers as he could as part of a jihad to protect Muslims and Taliban leaders from troops heading to Afghanistan. The mass shooting was the worst shooting at a U.S. military base. Hasan began the court-martial Aug. 7 by telling the jury of 13 senior Army officers he was the gunman. ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter,"" he said. If convicted, the Army psychiatrist could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. ""If you choose to testify, it is your choice and your choice solely,"" Osborn told Hasan Tuesday. ""If you do testify, you have to ask yourself questions. ... You can't simply give a statement. It has to be in a question-and-answer format."" Hasan has no legal training, and his former military attorneys, who Osborn has ordered to remain as legal advisers, have said he doesn't take their advice because he wants a death sentence. Among the final prosecution witnesses was a civilian who testified he photographed Hasan during the shooting. Asked if he recognized the man in the courtroom, Bennett pointed at Hasan, identifying him as ""the bearded individual."" Hasan has refused to shave, citing his religious beliefs.
Advertisement The last prosecution witness was a doctor who worked with Hasan at Fort Hood's medical center in the weeks before the attack. Dr. Tonya Kozminski testified Hasan told her before the shooting there would be consequences if the Army deployed him to Afghanistan. He earlier said he considered himself a conscientious objector on religious grounds. ""The last thing he said to me was, 'They will pay,'"" Kozminski testified. The unit with which he was to deploy was ordered to report for processing Nov. 5, 2009."

In the new motions made public on Tuesday, lawyers for James Holmes argue that the death penalty has been arbitrarily imposed in Colorado, is not a deterrent, is used so rarely that it's unconstitutional and that its use is cruel and usual. ""Imposition of the death penalty is rare, unusual, freakish, and inconsistently applied throughout the State of Colorado,"" defense lawyers wrote in a motion. Another motion asked that victims not be allowed to testify when the jury is deciding punishment and that opponents of the death penalty be allowed to sit on Holmes' jury. One of the motions also cites a 2009 study by the University of Colorado titled, ""Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates? The Views of Leading Criminologists,"" published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology that found, ""94 percent agreed that there was little empirical evidence to support the deterrent effect of the death penalty."" Colorado currently has three men sitting on death row and has only executed one person since the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in 1972. The death row inmates -- Nathan Dunlap, Sir Owens and Robert Ray -- were all sentenced in Arapahoe County.

Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy. By Maggie Clark Back to school usually means new notebooks, new clothes and new teachers. But this year it also means more security, after the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. “We would be remiss if we didn’t take a lesson from the Sandy Hook shooting, as horrible as it was,” said North Carolina Republican Rep. Craig Horn. He co-sponsored the state’s new plan to allow retired police officers or military veterans to serve as volunteer school security officers if they meet requirements set by local sheriffs and police chiefs. More than 450 bills were introduced in statehouses this year on school security measures. After thousands of hours of debate, what emerged at the state level are relatively small-scale plans to pay for security upgrades like adding classroom-door locks that can be used from the inside and outside, fortifying school entrances, installing security cameras and allowing teachers or volunteers, in very limited circumstances, to carry guns on campus. None of these are transformative solutions, said Ken Trump, a Cleveland-based school safety consultant who most recently worked with the Connecticut safety council to advise them on best practices in building safety. Trump noted that just a year ago, all the focus in school safety was on preventing bullying, which has moved to the back burner in favor of emergency drills and preparing for what to do if there’s a shooter in a school. “Schools are trying to reassure parents … but we haven’t seen a substantial investment to restore the devastating cuts to school resource officers and restart coordination with local first responders,” Trump said. “It’s really going to come down to parents to ask those questions if they want to sustain investment in their children’s schools.” In Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and North Carolina, state legislatures empowered local districts to decide if they want to allow a trained school employee or volunteer to be an armed guard at a local school. In North Carolina, there will likely be few schools that participate, said Eddie Caldwell Jr., general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, since both the local sheriff and the school board have to agree, and many sheriffs are skeptical of having an armed non-law enforcement officer in a school. However, the idea gained enough political traction to become law in four states and encourage teachers nationwide to sign up for gun training. The plan was also endorsed by Ohio Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine, both in response to the shooting in Newtown and a school shooting earlier in 2012 at a Chardon, Ohio, high school which left three students dead. “If I was on a school board…I would seriously consider having someone in that school who may be an ex-police officer, someone who has significant training, who had access to a gun in a school,” DeWine said in December. DeWine’s office issued a report in June with recommendations for schools to develop school safety plans, including model directions to teachers to use any means necessary to stop a shooter, including throwing books, and assaulting or choking the shooter. All Ohio schools are required to file an updated school safety plan with the attorney general’s office. In Texas, if local school districts give the OK, schools will select one anonymous staff member per every 400 students to carry a gun on campus, to act only if they identify an imminent threat. Training for that program will likely begin in the spring of 2014, according to the attorney general’s office. South Dakota opens its program to school employees or community volunteers, who must pass a criminal background check, go through an interview with the school board and pass a basic law enforcement training course before they can serve as an armed guard at a school. South Dakota Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley just approved the training guidelines last week and while no one has signed up yet, the attorney general’s office expects to begin offering training within the next month or two, according to a spokesperson. North Carolina’s plan falls on the more restrictive side, as the only people who can volunteer are retired police officers or military veterans. Once a school district and local law enforcement agency together decide they want to allow volunteer guards, the guards fall under the responsibility of the law enforcement agency. “The sheriff’s department has their own reputation on the line with this, so we feel confident they’ll pick the right people,” said Horn. He said volunteers will go through a strict vetting process so that, for instance, a military veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder is not guarding an elementary school. “We’re not playing cowboys and Indians here,” Horn said. “We have faith and confidence that the sheriff’s department will only put their neck on the line for the right people.” So far, no North Carolina district has expressed interest in the plan, so armed volunteers aren’t likely to end up schools until the 2014-2015 school year. While some lawmakers are on board with the idea of a trained volunteer carrying a gun in a school, others are saying no. After hearing about the Arkansas town of Clarksville’s plan to give teachers free firearms training and a $1,100 stipend to purchase a handgun, Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel issued a quick opinion clarifying that guns are not allowed on school campuses. At least 12 other school districts also had begun training teachers to act as school security. At the national level, the School Superintendents Association is firmly opposed to having teachers and administrators carry guns. Arming teachers has also been lambasted by teachers’ unions and public health experts. “Guns have no place in our schools. Period,” said the nation’s two largest teachers’ unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, in response to the National Rifle Association’s proposal to post at least one armed teacher or administrator in every school in the country. And given the statistical reality of being a gun violence victim in school—which is about one in 1 million, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Secret Service—having a gun to reduce gun violence may actually do the opposite. In Connecticut, teachers rejected the idea of carrying guns in the classroom and the state School Safety Infrastructure Council is looking at simple solutions like locks or communications systems. During the 2010-2011 school year, there were 11 homicides of children ages 5-18 at school, which was less than 2 percent of the total number of homicides of school-age children for each year going back to the 1992-1993 school year, according to a report  from the Congressional Research Service. In 2007, the most recent year for which a national count is available, there were just under 20,000 trained school resource officers in the nation’s 98,000 public schools, according to the Department of Justice. Only about 25 percent of those officers were in elementary schools. That will likely increase this year, said Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. Regardless of which state they live in, students heading back to school this month can expect to see more police officers, either designated school resource officers or regular police, said Canady. Students and teachers will also have to participate in more drills to prepare not just for an active shooter, but for tornadoes, fires or other disasters. Since January, 7,122 Ohio teachers and staff have received specialized training on how to respond, without a gun, to a shooter in the building. There are 28 more scheduled trainings in school districts this year. This training is also happening in Indiana, Oregon and Michigan. The Department of Homeland Security has an online course for the public to learn how to respond to an active shooter. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

In addition to having armed guards on every campus, the district is outfitting some teachers with domino-sized panic buttons. The company that makes the buttons, eTrak, announced the partnership in a press release Tuesday, one day after the new school year opened. The panic buttons -– which include GPS tracking devices –- alert a regional dispatcher, who can warn a school resource officer that help is needed, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Teachers and staff can receive information about lockdown procedures through the button as well, reports THE Journal, an education technology magazine. The buttons are part of the district’s #SAFEdragon initiative, which aims to increase campus safety. As part of the initiative, the district has been conducting background checks of volunteers, putting more fencing around school playgrounds, hiring police officers to guard every school and training staff members in safety measures, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “We're excited in Carroll ISD to be partnering with eTrak to improve communications and our emergency response time in the event of a school crisis,"" said Julie Thannum, assistant superintendent for board and community relations, in a press release. ""We believe the device is small enough to be worn comfortably and without much notice, while giving our employees a stronger sense of confidence that if they were to find themselves in a difficult or troublesome situation, they could reach out instantly for help."" The safety initiative came about as a direct result of the Sandy Hook elementary school mass shooting in December. “It builds the trust,” police Chief Stephen Mylett told the Forth Worth Star-Telegram last month. “It builds the relations. It helps alleviate that fear that we experienced following Sandy Hook.” The eTrak button was originally designed for caregivers who needed to keep track of the whereabouts of special needs children and Alzheimer’s patients.

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), was intern Daniel Hernandez Jr., who helped save his congresswoman's life. Later that year, he continued his public service when he was elected to the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District, which covers southern Tucson and adjacent areas in Pima County. Now, however, Hernandez is facing not only a recall campaign, but an anonymous anti-gay smear campaign as well. Four of the five members of the school board, in fact, are facing recall. On one side are the two opponents of superintendent Manuel Isquierdo -- including Hernandez. On the other side are the superintendent's supporters, who include board president Louie Gonzales. Hernandez and fellow board member Buck Crouch voted against extending Isquierdo's contract in June, after news broke about his financial and legal issues. Community members launched a recall effort against Gonzales and another Isquierdo supporter, Bobby Garcia, a month ago. Last week, supporters of Gonzales began a retaliatory recall effort against Hernandez and Crouch. But flyers being passed around to constituents, first reported by Right Wing Watch, go after Hernandez for being gay and for supporting gun control measures. ""Put a REAL Man on the Sunnyside Board,"" reads one flyer, with a picture of Hernandez speaking at an Equality Forum event. ""Daniel Hernandez is LGBT. We need someone who will support Sports and cares about our kids. We don't need someone who hates our values. RECALL Daniel Hernandez TODAY."" The second flyer claims that Hernandez ""cares about only one things [sic] taking your guns away."" Hernandez told The Huffington Post several parents had alerted him to the flyers, which were being distributed outside at least five of the 23 schools in the district. ""I've had a target on my back from my fellow board members for awhile because I don't go with the flow, and if something doesn't sound right or make sense, I call them out on it,"" Hernandez said. Hernandez said he first heard the ""real man"" attack during his 2011 campaign, when he ran against Garcia, who was voted onto the board in a subsequent election. The Hernandez recall campaign is being run by Marcos Castro, the campaign manager for Gonzales. Castro told The Huffington Post he had nothing to do with the Hernandez flyers, although he received one at his house. ""I don't have nothing to do with it,"" he said. Multiple requests to the office of the Sunnyside School Board to speak with Gonzales were not returned. Hernandez's opponents need to collect 1,300 signatures by Dec. 14 to get the recall vote on the ballot. ""My governing board president has started the recall process on me, with the people who are his friends and closest allies in the community. I'm not overly concerned they're going to get the 1,300 signatures, but just the negative tone and nature of the way they're doing it has been really bothersome and upsetting,"" said Hernandez. ""It's disheartening that this is where we are in 2013, that people think it's okay to put out these kinds of flyers about anybody,"" he added. UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- Gonzales told The Huffington Post that he was not at all involved in the flyers and does not support anti-gay attacks. He added that he believed Hernandez and his allies were actually the ones behind them, in a subterfuge attempt to make his opponents look bigoted. ""He's trying to turn this whole thing around,"" said Gonzales, adding, ""We're not anti-gay or gun control by any means.""

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)  National editor’s pick of the top news stories in the nation and world at this hour: Dozens killed in Syria; toxic gas attack alleged Photographs out of Syria showed dozens of corpses lined up, many of them children, as the opposition accused the regime of a toxic gas attack Wednesday in eastern Damascus that killed at least 100 people — or according to some reports, as many as 1,300. Shocking photos showed pale, dead children on the floors of makeshift hospitals, some still in diapers, and others with oxygen masks on their faces. Neither children nor adults had visible wounds or blood on their skin. The attack came as a 20-member U.N. chemical weapons team is in Syria to investigate previously reported chemical attacks. Syria said the claims of an attack were “absolutely baseless,” with the information minister calling activists’ claim a “disillusioned and fabricated one whose objective is to deviate and mislead” the U.N. mission. An opposition activist in Arbeen who identified himself by the pseudonym Abu Ahmad said he attended to dozens of injured people in a field hospital after the shelling on Zamalka and Ein Tarma early Wednesday. He said bodies of 63 of the dead had indications of a chemical weapons attack. “Their mouths were foaming, their pupils were constricted, and those who were brought in while still alive could not draw their breaths and died subsequently,” he told the Associated Press via Skype. “The skin around their eyes and noses was grayish.” Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was sentenced Wednesday to 35 years in prison for handing over a treasure trove of secret U.S. military and diplomatic documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Manning, 25, could have gotten 90 years, though prosecutors asked for 60. The defense sought 25, arguing that some of the documents he leaked would be declassified by then. Military judge Col. Denise Lind offered no explanation for her sentence. The former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, including espionage, though he was acquitted on the most serious charge, aiding the enemy. The native of Crescent, Okla., digitally copied and released more than 700,000 documents, including Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield reports and State Department cables, while working in 2010 in Iraq. Nidal Hasan rests case without presenting one Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, suspected of the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, rested his case Wednesday without calling a single witness or presenting a defense of any kind. Col. Tara Osborn asked Hasan how he wanted to proceed about five minutes after court began Wednesday, and he said, “The defense rests.” Osborn said: “You have the absolute right to remain silent. You do not have to say anything. You have the right to testify if you choose. Understand?” Hasan said he did. When the judge asked if this was his personal decision, he said: “It is.” Osborn then adjourned the trial until Thursday, when closing arguments will take place. Attorneys appointed as observers of the case on Hasan’s behalf have raised concerns that he is trying to be convicted and executed, so as to be martyred, though Hasan has denied this. Hasan indicated at the start of the trial that he would call two witnesses, a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and a California professor of psychology and religion. But on Tuesday, he indicated to the judge that he would not call either witness. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people in a mass shooting at the Texas military base. Egyptian court orders Mubarak released An Egyptian court on Wednesday ordered deposed strongman Hosni Mubarak released from custody, possibly as early as Thursday. But prosecutors could still appeal the order, which followed a hearing on charges that Mubarak accepted gifts from a state-owned newspaper. Top prison official Mostafa Baz told a TV station that prison officials will ask prosecutors Thursday whether Mubarak is wanted in other cases, and if not, he will be set free. The hearing was held in Tora prison, where Mubarak, 85, has been held for most of his detention since April 2011. He was found guilty of failing to stop the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising against him, but his sentence was overturned on appeal. He is to be retried later this month, and he faces other corruption charges for which no trial dates would be set. For many Egyptians, the release of Hosni Mubarak would complete the unraveling of the accomplishments of the Arab Spring revolution that swept away his regime. The upheaval led to democratic elections that seated Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi as president — until he was ousted by the military last month.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: FORT HOOD, Texas—Col. Michael Mulligan stood up and whispered to a fellow prosecutor who had just finished questioning a witness in the Fort Hood shooting trial, prompting the military lawyer to stand back up and ask how many bullet holes the gunman left behind. When Mulligan saw that frustrated jurors couldn’t hear another witness’ testimony, he asked the judge overseeing Maj. Nidal Hasan’s military trial to tell the witness to slow down and speak up. The lead prosecutor in the case against Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people at the Texas military base in 2009, has been something of a quality-control specialist, watching for any mistakes or oversights that could bolster a future appeal. Taking the trouble to confirm the number of bullet holes and making sure jurors can hear every witness may seem superfluous in a trial where the suspect has already told jurors he was responsible for the worst mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. But Mulligan and other prosecutors know that their biggest hurdle likely isn’t securing a conviction and death sentence, but rather making it through the military’s appeals courts—which have overturned most death sentences they’ve reviewed. Mulligan, an experienced prosecutor with distinctive round glasses and a carrying voice, did not deliver the prosecution’s opening statement and has questioned fewer than half of the 70 witnesses who have testified so far. He has occasionally spoken up to make sure procedures are being followed, and twice this week, his fellow prosecutors asked more questions after he quietly spoke to them. “Remember that Mulligan is not just a lawyer, he’s an officer and a leader, and he’s in the Army,” said Geoffrey Corn, a professor at the South Texas College of Law who taught Mulligan at the graduate level. “One of the fundamental responsibilities of a leader in the Army is to prepare your subordinates to do your job.” Mulligan’s appointment was a sign of how seriously the Army takes the Hasan case, Corn said. Mulligan has served in high-level Army positions in Iraq, Germany and the United States, according to an official biography. He is also a rarity in the military justice system: a prosecutor who has successfully put a soldier on death row. Mulligan prosecuted Hasan Akbar, a soldier condemned for killing two in an attack on fellow soldiers in Kuwait during the 2003 Iraq invasion. Such sentences are rare in the military justice system. Only 16 death sentences have been handed down during courts-martial, or military trials, over the last three decades—and 11 of those have been overturned, most on appeal due to errors made at trial. No active-duty soldier has been executed since 1961. Just last week, an Air Force appeals court overturned the sentence of Air Force airman Andrew Witt, condemned in 2005 for killing two people at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. Corn speculated that such cases are on Mulligan’s mind. “He knows probably better than most people wearing uniform today … that the trial has to be done as perfectly as humanly possible,” Corn said. An overturned sentence for Hasan would be an embarrassment for Army officials, as the death penalty was a key reason for even having an expensive, long-delayed trial. Hasan wanted to plead guilty but wasn’t allowed because a death sentence was on the table. Hasan has put up almost no defense so far, letting almost every prosecution witness pass without questions or objections. Hasan, who is acting as his own attorney during the trial, acknowledged the prosecution’s overwhelming advantage in his brief opening statement: The evidence against him, Hasan said, would clearly show he was the shooter. But appeals are automatic in death row cases. That means appellate judges, who are accustomed to overturning more death penalty cases than they let stand, will pore through the trial record and evidence if they get the case. While prosecutors clearly have an advantage in how much evidence is on their side, the 13-officer jury must be unanimous in convicting Hasan of premeditated murder and for approving a death sentence. That’s when Mulligan’s experience will be particularly crucial, Corn said. “Proving guilt was not particularly significant,” he said. “It was going to be in sentencing … and it was going to be on appeal.” ————— Follow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant.

President Obama shouldn’t expect a warm welcome when he visits Russia this week for the scheduled G20 meeting in St. Petersburg. Russian officials have dismissed the claim by American officials that the Syrian government ordered a chemical attack in August that caused hundreds of deaths as “rubbish.” And last week Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to Obama’s position on Syria as “utter nonsense.” Adding a further dose of insult on the eve of the diplomatic meeting, a high-ranking Russian official, the vice chairman of the Russian lower house, the Duma, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is suggesting in interviews with Russian journalists that Obama should be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize. Already the U.S.-Russian relationship is at a nadir. In what was widely regarded a snub of Washington, the Russians last month granted asylum to Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker. Shortly after, Obama went on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno to bash Russia’s ban on “homosexual propaganda.” And with the G20 summit this week likely devoted to Syria, sparks are flying as the two countries square off over the contentious issue of possible airstrikes against President Bashar al-Assad, whose regime Moscow supports. In Russia, observers believe it will be all but impossible for American officials to bring the Putin government around to Washington’s viewpoint on the proposed strikes. And judging by the state media’s coverage, they might be right. “Obama Burnt His Peace Pipe,” the Kremlin’s main newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, declared in a headline, while the paper Izvestia reminisced about the “fake reasons” that led the U.S. to war in Iraq in 2003. And on state-run television, Russian experts suggest that Obama wants to bomb Syria not because the administration wants to punish Assad for reportedly attacking rebels and civilians with chemical weapons, but because Washington wants to raise oil prices to help American oil companies. Yuri Krupnov, an analyst with the Institute for Demography, Migration and Regional Development, called Obama’s approach to Syria an “outlaw strategy” of making key decisions on war and peace for the entire planet. “Obama behaves as if he is in a Western movie, acting like a cowboy, pulling out his Colt to be the first one to shoot,” said Krupnov, whose think tank is affiliated with the Kremlin. “If the mass shooting begins, we Russians will also have to grab a Colt, and aim at the enemy, unfortunately.” Inside the Kremlin, officials said they were “disappointed” by the call for strikes—and the deteriorating rapport between Moscow and Washington. “Our relationship with the U.S. has been growing colder and colder,” said the Duma deputy, Robert Schlegel. “If the U.S. Congress supports President Obama’s bully decision to get involved in a war in Syria, I can guarantee 100 percent that our relations with United States will grow much worse.” On the streets of Moscow, however, there appears to be more sympathy for Obama and a possible campaign against the Syrian government. Earlier this week, the independent radio station Echo of Moscow ran a telephone and Internet survey, asking listeners whether the world’s superpower should get involved in military attacks against authorities who use weapons of mass destruction against their citizens. More than 75 percent of radio listeners agreed, though the radio station’s host, Olga Bychkova, was more equivocal. “I personally agree with Obama’s logic that terrorist Syrian authorities using such dreadful weapons against their people should be punished,” she said, adding: “But without bombing cities, by avoiding the war.”","SEARCH Anna Nemtsova on Russia’s resistance to Obama’s Syria plans.

Holmes' legal team argued in a court filing Friday Colorado's death penalty is sought so infrequently it qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment and the rules governing death penalty trials unfairly bias the jury against defendants.
Advertisement Citing a study by two University of Colorado law professors Holmes' defense team commissioned in another death penalty case, the attorneys said of the 544 first-degree murder cases in Colorado since 1999, 92 percent met the state's death penalty standard. Despite that, in only five cases have prosecutors sought the death penalty.
RELATED Court: Fox News reporter must testify in theater shooting trial In several motions unveiled Tuesday, Holmes' lawyers argued the state's death penalty statute should be invalidated, The Denver Post reported. Because so many of the state's first-degree murder cases meet the death penalty threshold, the lawyers argued Colorado's law does not meet the U.S. Supreme Court's stipulation that capital punishment be limited in its use. And because it has been sought so infrequently -- and only by one district attorney's office, the one prosecuting Holmes -- its application is arbitrary.

RELATED James Holmes arrives at mental institute for evaluation Lawyers also argued that jurors seated in a capital murder case are all asked whether they could sentence a person to death, thereby ""death qualifying"" the jury, and seating a panel that's predisposed to convict the accused. ""Imposition of the death penalty is rare, unusual, freakish and inconsistently applied throughout the State of Colorado,"" the defense lawyers wrote. Holmes' lawyers have admitted their client was the gunman in a horrific shooting at a movie theater in Aurora last year, during which he killed 12 people and wounded dozens more at a midnight screening.

David Griffis, 44, who had been in critical condition after shooter Hubert Allen Jr., 72, shot four co-workers from Pritchett Trucking Company in this northern Florida community about 50 miles southwest of Jacksonville, succumbed to his wounds Tuesday, Union County sheriff's officials said. ""I'm very well heartsick because he was a friend of mine,"" Ricky Waller said. ""He was always very cheerful and a hard working man who loved his family -- and his friends. And he was a friend to me,"" The Rev. Patrick Maxwell of Victory Christian Center said even family members do not know why Allen went on the shooting spree.

He shot and killed former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28, around 9 a.m., then went a short distance and killed Pritchett, 80, who began the company in 1980. At one time Allen, the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back C.J. Spiller, was considered his top assistant. A few minutes later, Allen saw another former co-worker, Lewis Mabrey Jr., 66, driving a farm tractor, exchanged words with him and fired a shotgun, authorities said. Mabrey was released from the hospital Tuesday. Allen then went to company headquarters here and shot Griffis. &amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;gt; Afterward, Allen went home and killed himself. Deputies recovered a .22-caliber rifle, a .410-small-bore shotgun and an unfired .32-caliber handgun. Waller said he'll focus on the positive and the good times he had with Griffis. ""He was just always smiling,"" Waller said. ""He didn't deserve what he got.""

151900094,2013-08-29 13:01:50,New Kettering University student club wants to carry concealed guns on Flint campus,http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/08/kettering_university_students_16.html,en,False,,65422,mlive.com,http://mlive.com/," FLINT, MI – Some Kettering University students want to start a
conversation about allowing the carrying of concealed firearms on campus. And they've started a club to do it. Kettering Students for Concealed Carry became an official
university club Aug. 1, and members are taking the opportunity to get students talking. ""We believe that while college campuses are usually safer
than other public places, we still think that anything can happen,"" said Kaity
Huff, KSCC vice president. ""Calling this a gun-free space won't stop a crazy
person."" The group of roughly 20 active members out of the almost 900 students in their section wants to invite others to join the conversation. A group of students has been discussing similar topics
since 2011, but becoming an official club allows them to reach out to more
students, club officials said. They want to dispel misconceptions about
concealed carry in general and on college campuses, as well as promote
conversation to change policy. Changing policy is not to say that every student will be
carrying a gun, however, Huff said. The goal is to allow those with concealed weapons permits to
carry on campus, just like most public places. Michigan law prohibits concealed carry weapons in all classrooms
and dormitories. Kettering, like almost all colleges in Michigan – except Michigan
State University – extends the ban to the entire campus. ""We recognize that university policy can't change overnight,""
Huff said. ""We really want to promote discussion."" Flint Mayor Dayne Walling, who is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns which aims to prevent gun violence, said he agreed with the current university policy of prohibiting firearms. “The university has already made a determination about its policy based on safety of its students and campus,” Walling said. “I think each institution has the responsibility of setting policies for the public health of their staff and students.” Even though Flint is ranked the most violent city in the nation, KSCC members say the group isn’t about violence in the area. In fact, there are many reports of college campuses being safer than other public areas, the club board members said. They want to promote concealed carry on campus to give students, faculty and staff the right to carry concealed weapons just like other public areas and for self-defense in case something does happen. Concealed carry would be allowed only for those who have gone through the proper training to receive their Concealed Pistol License. KSCC stems from the national group Students for Concealed Carry, which claims more than 43,000 college students, professors, staff and citizens involved. According to the national group's website, group officials say it's not fair to make concealed carry on campuses off limits just because colleges are safer places. The mass shooting that took place Virginia Tech in 2007 was cited as an example of what can happen even when guns are prohibited on campus. “While it may be safe to say colleges overall are less prone to crime than national averages, these numbers are useless in determining an individual’s personal vulnerability to robbery or rape, or a campus’ vulnerability to mass shootings,” the Students for Concealed Carry website states. In the near future, the Flint club hopes to organize a town hall
meeting with speakers from both sides of the issue and invite the campus
community to join. ""As part of the college experience, Kettering
University encourages all of its students to engage in causes and issues that
they are passionate about,"" said Betsy Homsher, Kettering University vice
president of student life and dean of students. ""As an institution, we are
always open to hearing feedback from students and we take those concerns
seriously."" The group meets Tuesdays around noon in the Sunset Cafe inside the Campus Center. The
group has seen an increase in interest and participation since becoming a club,
said Dan Keys, club president. The Kettering Students for Concealed Carry Facebook group
has more than 150 members and more people have reached out to the club, he said. The club hopes to not only discuss policy at Kettering but also address state and national policies. On Tuesday, Sept. 3, the group plans an Empty Holster
Protest, in which members will walk around campus wearing empty holsters, while talking
about club's position. ""It demonstrates that when are around this campus, we are
defenseless,"" said Keys, 22, of Northville. In general, there is often a fear of the word ""gun,"" Huff said.
The group hopes to defuse the fear and educate the campus community on concealed
carry laws and initiatives. Looking at Genesee County as a whole, the interest in Concealed
Pistol Licenses (CPLs) is growing. The number of CPLs in Genesee County has increased steadily
over the years, said Doreen Fulcher, Genesee County elections supervisor. In
2008, there were 2,405 CPL applicants. That increased to 5,083 in 2012. In January of this year there were 787 applications, which
is up from 427 in January of 2011. Kettering sophomore Hunter Casbeer was a class representative for Kettering Student Government when the group proposed the idea. “Everyone’s reaction was ‘Whoa, are they wanting to get students to carry guns on campus?’ “ said Casbeer, 20. “It was sort of a shock to the people on the Senate at least.” Their goals from what Casbeer gathered was to raise awareness and allow campus officers to carry guns, which he thought was a good idea. But he doesn't believe it would be a good idea to have students carry guns on campus. “But students would be a different story. I think it would cause more trouble. I couldn’t see students doing it,"" he said. “I honestly couldn’t see any reason for them to be carrying it. I feel like it’s pretty safe throughout Kettering.” Freshman Shaun Smith, however, is in support of carrying concealed weapons on campus. “I think it would be nice, because then people could learn to defend themselves in bad situations. Learning how to properly handle a gun is a good idea, in my opinion,"" Smith said. The group also hopes to host classes where experts talk about firearm safety, safety tips and the law. Not everyone in Kettering Students for Concealed Carry has
their CPL, but they all have interest in discussing policy change. ""Why should you feel any different on a college campus than
in public?"" asked Blaise Friery, a member of the KSCC. MLive-Flint Journal reporter Chris Aldridge contributed to this report.

We've received your submission. It’s not really news that Nidal Malik Hasan has been convicted in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings that left 13 dead and 31 injured. After all, many saw him do it, and on the first day of trial Hasan himself said the evidence would show him to be the shooter. Now a military jury will consider whether he should receive the death penalty. If they so decide, they would have to do so unanimously, and it would still require President Obama’s sign-off. We share America’s relief that the trial is over. We also share America’s irritation at the outrages it raised. From the start, Hasan has exposed troubling things about our Army and our government. Begin with this: Before he went on his rampage, federal authorities had seen his Internet postings on suicide bombings and had intercepted more than a dozen e-mails he’d sent to Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical American-born imam based in Yemen. In them, Hasan asked whether killing US soldiers would be considered an act of jihad. When he was investigated, the conclusion was that these e-mails constituted “professional research.” He then told fellow soldiers Muslims would be justified in killing US troops. Instead of being reported, he was promoted. Even after the killings and his arrest, Hasan played the system. First, he prevented the Army from forcibly shaving him, even though military regulations forbid beards. Later he would succeed in getting the judge who initially ruled against him tossed from the case for supposed bias. But the greatest shame of the Fort Hood massacre — the worst mass shooting on a US military installation — is what our government calls it: “workplace violence.” Not only is this inaccurate, it means victims and their families are not eligible for special compensation that provides disability pay and a higher level of medical benefits. The fact is, this case has been plagued from the beginning by a lack of honesty. Now that the trial is over, let’s hope our government can at least call the Fort Hood attack by its rightful name: terrorism. Share Selection"

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last week that Landon Wynar’s threat to massacre classmates at Douglas High School were not a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. Wynar was a 16-year-old sophomore when he was arrested in 2008 after students reported his comments in messages on MySpace. He filed a lawsuit in 2009 claiming the school board had no authority to suspend him for things done off school property. The Nevada Appeal reports (http://tinyurl.com/o9ww5lt ) the San Francisco-based appellate court upheld the suspension partly because his comments evoking images of the slayings at Virginia Tech presented a clear danger to others. Wynar was jailed for 31 days and suspended for 10 days until an expulsion hearing before the Douglas County School Board led to him being removed from school. The 9th Circuit Court concluded Wynar “engaged in a string of increasingly violent and threatening instant messages sent from his home to his friends, bragging about his weapons, threatening to shoot specific classmates, intimidating that he would ‘take out’ other people at a school shooting on a specific date and invoking the image of the Virginia Tech massacre,” Judge Margaret McKeown wrote in the opinion on Thursday. The Virginia Tech campus was the scene of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history when a student-gunman killed 32 students and faculty before killing himself on April 16, 2007. Wynar admitted in interviews with two sheriff’s deputies he sent the messages, but claimed they were a joke, prosecutors said. The MySpace messages included threats against two or three specific students and disturbed friends who reported them to school officials. They included references to “that stupid kid from vtech” and said, “I bet I could get 50+ people and not one bullet would be wasted.” “The nature of the threats here was alarming and explosive,” the court ruled. “The messages presented a real risk of significant disruption to school activities and interfered with the rights of other students. Under the circumstances, the school district did not violate Landon’s rights to freedom of expression or due process.” The court said that in such a circumstance, the district could take disciplinary action against off-campus speech and was responsible to do so. “Landon specified a date for the attack and described how he would kill two specific named classmates,” the justices wrote, adding, “Douglas County did not need to wait for an actual disruption to materialize before taking action.” —— Information from: Nevada Appeal, http://www.nevadaappeal.com Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: FORT HOOD, Texas—The Army psychiatrist on trial for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood passed on his final chance to address jurors before they started deliberating Thursday, even after prosecutors insisted they hand down a verdict that would allow the death penalty. Maj. Nidal Hasan is acting as his own attorney but declined to plead his case after prosecutors finished their closing argument. When the judge told Hasan he could begin, he said: “The defense chooses not to make a closing statement.” The Army psychiatrist is facing numerous counts of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder for the attack, which killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the sprawling Army post in central Texas on Nov. 5, 2009. It was the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. Prosecutors laid out a detailed roadmap of their case during their closing argument, saying there was no question that Hasan planned and carried out the attack. “The facts I laid out to you give you only one option,” the prosecutor, Col. Steve Henricks, told jurors. “The accused without a doubt—without any doubt at all—had a premeditated design to kill.” Jurors began deliberating Thursday afternoon. After about three hours, they asked if they could review the testimony of Sgt. Mark Todd, the Fort Hood police officer who ended the rampage by shooting the gunman. In a statement submitted to the court, Todd testified that Hasan fired at him before he fired back, hit the soldier and then kicked away his gun. The judge agreed to the review, then she allowed jurors to leave for the evening. Deliberations are scheduled to resume Friday morning. During his brief opening statement two weeks ago, Hasan told jurors that evidence would “clearly show” he was the shooter. He also described himself as a soldier who had “switched sides.” But since then, he has sat mostly silent in his wheelchair. Hasan, who was paralyzed after he was shot during the attack, has raised few objections during the 13-day trial. He questioned only three of the nearly 90 witnesses called by prosecutors, and the only piece of evidence he submitted was an evaluation from his boss that called him a good soldier. On Thursday, military prosecutors asked jurors for a unanimous conviction on the premeditated murder charges, which would allow them to seek the death penalty—the government’s priority in the case. Henricks repeatedly emphasized the word “premeditation,” trying to dissuade the jury—13 high-ranking military officers—of even considering a conviction on a lesser charge that would take the death penalty off the table. “There’s no doubt the evidence you heard in this case shows he committed the offense,” Henricks said. Henricks said Hasan asked for the highest-tech weapon available when he went to a gun store a few months before the Nov. 5, 2009, attack, and he soon began practicing at a gun range. Hasan also used laser sights, which Henricks said “established intent to kill.” The prosecutor noted that the shootings, which started inside a medical building crowded with soldiers preparing to deploy, came the same day Hasan’s unit was at that building. Hasan was assigned to soon join the unit in Afghanistan on a six-month tour. The last witness to testify for prosecutors had said Hasan told her shortly before the shooting, without prompting, that the Army would “pay” if he were ever ordered deployed overseas. “Some things speak for themselves. It doesn’t require any evidence—because it’s no coincidence—that the accused did his crime on Five November,” Henricks told jurors. Henricks also noted that Hasan targeted soldiers, leaving most civilians unscathed. After Hasan fled the medical building, and civilians outside asked him what was going on, “he tells them it’s a paintball gun. It’s a training exercise. He’s keeping his wits about him even after what happened,” Henricks said. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, has been unapologetic about saying the rampage was necessary to protect Muslim insurgents abroad from American soldiers preparing for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. But most of his arguments have played out through leaks to the media or directly to the judge, so they couldn’t be considered by the jury. ——— Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Fort Hood. ——— Follow Paul J.

Nidal Hasan guilty of multiple counts of murder and attempted murder in connection with a mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009 that killed 13 people and injured more than 30 others. The verdict came as no surprise given that the U.S. Army major admitted at the start of the military court-martial that he had shot soldiers who were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, argued that he was trying to defend fellow Muslims who he believed had been unfairly targeted by U.S. forces. The Nov. 5, 2009, incident ranks among the worst acts of soldier-on-soldier violence in U.S. military history. In total, Hasan was convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. The trial will next move to a sentencing phase, which will decide whether  Hasan receives a sentence of life in prison or death for his crimes. He will have an opportunity during sentencing to further explain his conduct or to offer mitigating evidence, such as claiming his prior good deeds should entitle him to a measure of clemency. Victims of the shooting will also have an opportunity to confront Hasan and describe the toll the shooting has taken on their lives. The verdict followed a short closing phase of the trial Thursday in which prosecutors carefully recapped their case, and the U.S.-born Hasan, representing himself, offered no closing argument at all.

President Obama shouldn’t expect a warm welcome when he visits Russia this week for the scheduled G20 meeting in St. Petersburg. Russian officials have dismissed the claim by American officials that the Syrian government ordered a chemical attack in August that caused hundreds of deaths as “rubbish.” And last week Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to Obama’s position on Syria as “utter nonsense.” Adding a further dose of insult on the eve of the diplomatic meeting, a high-ranking Russian official, the vice chairman of the Russian lower house, the Duma, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is suggesting in interviews with Russian journalists that Obama should be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize. Already the U.S.-Russian relationship is at a nadir. In what was widely regarded a snub of Washington, the Russians last month granted asylum to Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker. Shortly after, Obama went on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno to bash Russia’s ban on “homosexual propaganda.” And with the G20 summit this week likely devoted to Syria, sparks are flying as the two countries square off over the contentious issue of possible airstrikes against President Bashar al-Assad, whose regime Moscow supports. In Russia, observers believe it will be all but impossible for American officials to bring the Putin government around to Washington’s viewpoint on the proposed strikes. And judging by the state media’s coverage, they might be right. “Obama Burnt His Peace Pipe,” the Kremlin’s main newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, declared in a headline, while the paper Izvestia reminisced about the “fake reasons” that led the U.S. to war in Iraq in 2003. And on state-run television, Russian experts suggest that Obama wants to bomb Syria not because the administration wants to punish Assad for reportedly attacking rebels and civilians with chemical weapons, but because Washington wants to raise oil prices to help American oil companies. Yuri Krupnov, an analyst with the Institute for Demography, Migration and Regional Development, called Obama’s approach to Syria an “outlaw strategy” of making key decisions on war and peace for the entire planet. “Obama behaves as if he is in a Western movie, acting like a cowboy, pulling out his Colt to be the first one to shoot,” said Krupnov, whose think tank is affiliated with the Kremlin. “If the mass shooting begins, we Russians will also have to grab a Colt, and aim at the enemy, unfortunately.” Inside the Kremlin, officials said they were “disappointed” by the call for strikes—and the deteriorating rapport between Moscow and Washington. “Our relationship with the U.S. has been growing colder and colder,” said the Duma deputy, Robert Schlegel. “If the U.S. Congress supports President Obama’s bully decision to get involved in a war in Syria, I can guarantee 100 percent that our relations with United States will grow much worse.” On the streets of Moscow, however, there appears to be more sympathy for Obama and a possible campaign against the Syrian government. Earlier this week, the independent radio station Echo of Moscow ran a telephone and Internet survey, asking listeners whether the world’s superpower should get involved in military attacks against authorities who use weapons of mass destruction against their citizens. More than 75 percent of radio listeners agreed, though the radio station’s host, Olga Bychkova, was more equivocal. “I personally agree with Obama’s logic that terrorist Syrian authorities using such dreadful weapons against their people should be punished,” she said, adding: “But without bombing cities, by avoiding the war.”","SEARCH Anna Nemtsova on Russia’s resistance to Obama’s Syria plans.

Yuri Krupnov, an analyst with the Institute for Demography, Migration and Regional Development, called Obama’s approach to Syria an “outlaw strategy” of making key decisions on war and peace for the entire planet. “Obama behaves as if he is in a Western movie, acting like a cowboy, pulling out his Colt to be the first one to shoot,” said Krupnov, whose think tank is affiliated with the Kremlin. “If the mass shooting begins, we Russians will also have to grab a Colt, and aim at the enemy, unfortunately.” Inside the Kremlin, officials said they were “disappointed” by the call for strikes—and the deteriorating rapport between Moscow and Washington. “Our relationship with the U.S. has been growing colder and colder,” said the Duma deputy, Robert Schlegel. “If the U.S. Congress supports President Obama’s bully decision to get involved in a war in Syria, I can guarantee 100 percent that our relations with United States will grow much worse.” On the streets of Moscow, however, there appears to be more sympathy for Obama and a possible campaign against the Syrian government. Earlier this week, the independent radio station Echo of Moscow ran a telephone and Internet survey, asking listeners whether the world’s superpower should get involved in military attacks against authorities who use weapons of mass destruction against their citizens. More than 75 percent of radio listeners agreed, though the radio station’s host, Olga Bychkova, was more equivocal. “I personally agree with Obama’s logic that terrorist Syrian authorities using such dreadful weapons against their people should be punished,” she said, adding: “But without bombing cities, by avoiding the war.”"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. FORT HOOD, Texas – Maj. Nidal Hasan hasn't made disruptive outbursts while on trial for the worst mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. When soldiers pointed to him as the gunman, he forgoes his right to question them, diffusing expectations of tense exchanges. For a long-awaited trial that figured to dramatically unfold over months, a swift finish without spectacle now seems more likely. Military prosecutors on Wednesday were set to continue calling witnesses who have recounted — with vivid and heart-wrenching detail — the shooting massacre at Fort Hood to a jury of 13 high-ranking military officers. But inside the small military courtroom at the Texas Army post, the atmosphere has been largely muted. The lack of drama has speeded up a trial that may now be finished early as next week.

Here's an early look: http://bit.ly/19wPNz7 BAE’S HUDSON TO STEP DOWN IN 2014: BAE Systems President and CEO Linda Hudson announced Tuesday that she will retire in the first quarter of 2014. In an email to employees, Hudson said she will stay on the company’s board of directors until 2015. Hudson made history in October 2009 by becoming the first woman to head a major defense firm in the U.S. But she has faced difficult circumstances during her tenure, presiding over the company during sequestration and a failed merger attempt with EADS. In an email to employees, Hudson praised the company’s resilience in a difficult economic climate and said, “The time has come for me to move on.” Last month, BAE Systems named U.K. businessman Roger Carr its new chairman. FLASHBACK: Back in March,  The Washington Post's Marjorie Censer and Jim Tankersley wrote about the fact that three of the biggest U.S. defense firms were led by women. ""I think it's a chance for all of us … to make an imprint on an industry,"" Hudson told the Post. http://bit.ly/16Pdt2I WHAT THEY’RE SAYING: — ""Hudson rose to the top of her male-dominated industry the old-fashioned way: by out-performing all her rivals and never turning down an assignment,"" wrote defense consultant Loren Thompson in a blog post for the Lexington Institute. ""She began her tenure as head of BAE Systems, Inc. by cutting costs and streamlining the organization in anticipation of softening Pentagon demand, a move that has allowed the company to continue generating strong returns despite the winding down of overseas wars."" http://bit.ly/13CqBYK — ""So now we prepare for one of the three women CEOs in this industry to move on,” wrote Jill R. Aitoro, a senior reporter at the Washington Business Journal. “Chances are, her replacement will be a man — not because men are any more capable, and not because BAE Systems has any preference one way or the other. But because in this market, men are inevitably more plentiful. We can all point to Hewson and [General Dynamics CEO Phebe] Novakovic, but their appointments were a surprise for a reason — even if they were well-deserved and hard-earned. They too were anomalies.” http://bit.ly/1811c70 CHINA TALKS CONTINUE: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chang Wanquan continued their discussions Monday over lunch and dinner, according to Pentagon press secretary George Little. Monday night’s dinner lasted two ½ hours and included an exchange of gifts. Hagel gave Chang a tray decorated with an old map of Washington. From Chang, Hagel received a few gifts including “some very nice vases” and a plate with a photo of Hagel on it, Little told reporters. “I’d characterize the dinner as very warm and consistent with the very good meetings we had throughout the day,” Little said. ** A message from POWERJobs: New jobs on our radar this week: State Outreach Director at Nuclear Energy Institute, Senior Policy Advisor at The Nature Conservancy and Communications Director at Global Policy Solutions.

'These kinds of national security meetings are not uncommon,' spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. 'The president does chair them on a regular basis and I’m sure it’s not even the first one they’ve had on this topic. At this point, I wouldn’t anticipate any major announcements related to our aid assistance in the immediate aftermath of this meeting.' http://politi.co/19wPXqa The decision of whether to continue aging Egypt is a political headache for the Obama administration, which does not want to appear to endorse the continuing violence in Egypt but also wants to maintain influence in the region. Congressional lawmakers remain divided over whether the aid should be cut off, arguing that Washington would lose leverage in Egypt. PROSECUTION RESTS IN FORT HOOD TRIAL, via The Wall Street Journal's Nathan Koppel: ""Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday against the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others during a mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009, clearing the way for the defendant, Nidal Hasan, to mount his own defense on Wednesday. The court-martial has progressed rapidly, with Maj. Hasan, a U.S. born Muslim, admitting on day one of the trial that he shot at soldiers set to deploy to Afghanistan because he perceived America to be at war against Islam. “Maj. Hasan, who is representing himself in the proceedings, is expected to offer at most an abbreviated defense when the trial resumes Wednesday.

Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of committing the worst mass shooting ever on a US military base, felt he had a 'jihad duty,' or believed he would be a martyr. Loading... August 18, 2013 The prosecutors pursuing the death penalty against the Army psychiatrist accused in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage will soon begin trying to answer a difficult but key question: Why did Maj. Nidal Hasan attack his fellow soldiers in the worst mass shooting ever on a US military base? Both sides offered a few hints so far. Although he's been mostly silent in the courtroom, Hasan used his brief opening statement to tell jurors he had ""switched sides"" in what he called America's war with Islam; he later leaked documents to the media showing he believed he could be a martyr. Military prosecutors opened the trial by saying they would show that Hasan felt he had a ""jihad duty,"" referring to a Muslim term for a religious war or struggle. After calling almost 80 witnesses over two weeks, prosecutors said Friday they would begin tackling the question this week. How much they can say to jurors, however, may be limited by the judge. Even though plenty of information about Hasan's extremist views has been published since the rampage, the 13 military officers on the jury said they had not closely followed the case and wouldn't read news coverage during the trial. Prosecutors asked the military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, on Friday to approve evidence and several witnesses to explain Hasan's mindset. Such evidence includes references to Hasan Akbar, a Muslim soldier sentenced to death for attacking fellow soldiers in Kuwait during the 2003 Iraq invasion. Prosecutor Col. Steve Henricks told Osborn that Hasan had shown interest in Akbar's case and prosecutors wanted to prove Hasan's attack was a ""copycat."" The skeptical judge told Henricks she didn't want to hold a ""mini-trial"" of Akbar and asked how he would introduce the case to jurors. Henricks said he planned to call a prosecutor to discuss its basics, but he didn't identify the prosecutor. Akbar was prosecuted by Col. Mike Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in Hasan's trial. Henricks has alleged that besides his so-called ""jihad duty,"" Hasan was looking for ways to get out of deploying, and he said witnesses could include former classmates who heard him talking about suicide bombers. Prosecutors also said they wanted to introduce three emails, but they didn't disclose details. The FBI has said Hasan sent numerous emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical US-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Osborn promised to rule Monday on what prosecutors could present. Even if Osborn keeps out most or all of the disputed evidence — a possibility since any issue could come up on appeal — prosecutors have done plenty to prove Hasan deserves the death penalty, said Richard Rosen, a military law expert who teaches at Texas Tech University. He described some of what prosecutors hope to present as further ""nails in the coffin."" ""This isn't a terrorism trial, and she may decide that this would just unnecessarily inflame the jury, and that it's not worth the risk,"" Rosen said. ""But it clearly is relevant evidence."" Prosecutors said they had between 15 and 25 witnesses left, meaning Hasan could get his chance to defend himself as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. He signaled before trial that he had just two witnesses. Hasan — who is acting as his own attorney — told jurors during a barely one-minute opening statement that evidence ""will clearly show that I am the shooter,"" but he said it wouldn't tell the whole story. Since then, his defense has been nearly non-existent. He questioned only two of prosecutors' witnesses and didn't object to hundreds of pieces of evidence. He mumbled through a series of rambling questions of his former supervisor, retired Lt. Col. Ben Phillips, talking about ""medical personnel initiating mercy killings"" and a water supply in Iraq being contaminated with gas. But he was cut off by prosecutors' objection, which was upheld by the judge. Among those likely to pay especially close attention are victims pressing the federal government to formally acknowledge the Fort Hood shootings as an act of terror, not workplace violence, and provide more benefits. ""We're very interested to see whether and to what extent the government pursues Hasan's jihadism,"" said Reed Rubinstein, an attorney for the victims. ""It would be welcome if the prosecutor would make very explicit the fact that this was a jihadist attack. This was terrorism."" Rubinstein is much less interested in what Hasan has to say.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

On the table was a package for a pistol laser sight, rubber bands and paper towels. Witnesses have testified that Hasan stuffed paper towels in his pockets before the attack to muffle the sound of his ammunition.

Osborn promised to rule Monday on what prosecutors could present. While prosecutors clearly have an advantage in how much evidence is on their side, the 13-officer jury in Texas needs to be unanimous in convicting Hasan of premeditated murder and for approving a death sentence. Such sentences are rare in the military justice system: Only 16 death sentences have been handed down during courts-martial, or military trials, over the past three decades - and 11 of those have been overturned, most on appeal due to errors in the trial. As a result, prosecutors have been careful to watch for any oversights or mistakes during the trial. Even if Osborn keeps out most or all of the disputed evidence, a possibility since any issue could come up on appeal, prosecutors have done plenty to prove Hasan deserves the death penalty, said Richard Rosen, a military law expert who teaches at Texas Tech University.

He bemoaned the lack of a ""national database of the mentally ill"" while decrying a 40 percent decrease in federal gun prosecutions of thugs and criminals. LaPierre identified the key to solving gun violence as getting guns away from, as he put it, ""genuine monsters -- people so deranged, so evil, so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can possibly ever comprehend them."" Mr. LaPierre is absolutely correct that these types of people should not be afforded the capacity to hurt themselves or others. The good news is that we as a nation are getting better at identifying the dangerously mentally ill and revoking their gun rights. The bad news is that when it comes to actually taking their guns from them, we collectively shrug our shoulders and move on to other challenges that require less time and energy. The fact is that the initial sale of a gun is almost always legal. It's at the point where the owner faces criminal charges or mental challenges that the issue of legality gets muddled. Perhaps the legal gun owner develops a mental illness. He or she could be convicted of a felony -- or become the subject of an order of protection as a result of stalking or issuing threats of violence. In my home state of Illinois -- and many others -- all of these represent grounds for losing one's right to own a gun, as well they should. Here in Cook County -- which includes Chicago and its suburbs and has a total population of over 5 million -- roughly 4,000 people have had their gun privileges revoked by the state yet have failed to turn in their guns, ammunition and firearm owner's identification card. Some of these people are seriously mentally ill; most live within close proximity to schools, parks and other public places. As Cook County Sheriff, I felt a responsibility to take action now, rather than waiting for the next mass shooting. In February, I assigned a dedicated police unit within my office to seize weapons from those individuals whose gun privileges had been revoked by the state. In just six months, this small team has singlehandedly collected more than 200 guns from criminals and the mentally ill who should be nowhere near these weapons. The stories are startling. One man, whose gun privileges were revoked due to his serious mental illness, possessed an arsenal of 35 guns -- including four assault weapons. Another man, the subject of an order of protection from his neighbor, openly fantasized to my officers about shooting both the neighbor and her dog and proceeding to bury them in his backyard. These are not isolated examples. These people exist everywhere, and they remain armed and dangerous to their communities. Yet, besides Cook County, only California maintains a program tasked with taking their guns away. Most states take proactive measures to revoke gun privileges when warranted but make no effort whatsoever to actually get the weapons away from people who pose dangers to themselves and their communities. Out of sight, out of mind. Why the lack of interest from law enforcement in removing those weapons? For some, it's a question of insufficient personnel and budgets. For others, it's simple ignorance of the law and what they as policing authorities can do to prevent tragedies. In no way does this strategy affect law-abiding gun owners -- solely the criminals and mentally ill who cannot legally own weapons yet fail or refuse to turn them in. It does not require legislation, lobbying or approval from elected officials. All it requires is the determination of sheriffs and police chiefs who take seriously their responsibilities to protect their respective communities from gun violence. Mentally unstable people should not have guns. Nor should criminals. Ensuring that they never obtain access to weapons in the first place is nice in concept. But when it fails in practice, law enforcement should take advantage of mechanisms to right those wrongs and get guns out of dangerous hands. Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois"

Kirkpatrick CAIRO — Amid an international outcry over a bloody crackdown, the new government installed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi is putting concerted pressure on the only remaining news outlets in Egypt covering criticism of the violence: the foreign news media. The military had already shut down all the Egyptian television networks that supported President Mohamed Morsi on the night the general ousted him. Now, in the last four days, the new authorities have raided and shut down the offices of the pan-Arab Al Jazeera network, taken steps to deny its Egyptian license and, on Sunday, arrested its correspondent Abdullah El-Shamy on charges of inciting murder and sectarian violence. Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, was the only big Arabic-language network considered sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood. Senior government officials, meanwhile, publicly scolded Western correspondents in two news conferences and a public statement for failing to portray the crackdown in the government’s terms: as a war against violent terrorists. On Sunday, even General Sisi joined the chorus, criticizing foreign news media for failing to appreciate his mandate to fight terrorism. The criticisms echoed incessantly through the state and private media, and, in an apparent response, vigilante supporters of General Sisi have attacked or detained at least a dozen foreign journalists, a vast majority on the same day that an adviser to the president delivered the first diatribe against Western news coverage. “One could be forgiven for saying that there is a coordinated campaign against the foreign journalists,” Matt Bradley, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, said Sunday in an interview with Al Jazeera’s English-language sister network. He described being pulled into an armored personnel carrier by soldiers rescuing him after a mob tackled him, tore at his clothes and took his notebook. Coming at the end of a week when security forces killed more than 1,000 Morsi supporters in the streets, the push to control how the news media portray the violence is the latest sign of the government’s authoritarian turn, which its officials have justified as emergency measures to save Egypt from a coordinated campaign of violence by the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood. Scholars and human rights activists say they see signs of broad coordination between Egypt’s state and private media to drive home the same messages. After the first mass shooting following the military takeover killed more than 60 Morsi supporters at a sit-in, for example, television talk shows across the state and private media seemed to suggest that the Islamists might have deliberately provoked the violence to tarnish the military. Later, all seemed to discover that even Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain had argued for limiting human rights in the interest of protecting national security. “There is very clear coordination,” said Heba Morayef, a researcher in Egypt for Human Rights Watch. “Forgetting what is true or not, it is interesting that you hear the same thing from everybody.” Prominent human rights activists whose criticism of the former government made them a staple of Egypt’s nightly talk shows for the last two years say invitations have dried up as they have continued to criticize the police’s disproportionate violence since General Sisi’s takeover on July 3. The scholars say the sudden pro-government unanimity of the Egyptian news media, following the cacophonous explosion of news media freedom after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak two years ago, is a throwback not just to the Mubarak era but much further — to the pre-satellite era when the government ran all Egyptian media. Some said the chorus of criticisms of the Islamists as “terrorists” — relatively seldom heard here until July — recalled the years of the early 1950s, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser consolidated his power by cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood. Even some of the headlines were almost the same, said Prof. Mona el-Ghobashy, a political scientist at Barnard who has tracked the Egyptian news media over the last eight months. “It is the same hyper-nationalist discourse about how the Islamists are terrorists, that these people represent a transnational Islamism or some kind of foreign import, so they are not real Egyptians.” Officials now charge, without evidence, that many protesters are Syrian or Palestinian. She noted a pattern of “dehumanizing” the Islamists across the state and private media that began shortly after General Sisi removed Mr. Morsi, when the Islamists established a tent-city protest camp. Talk-show hosts said participants of the sit-in had scurvy. Other media outlets gleefully repeated an allegation by a government-sponsored women’s group that the Islamists there were conducting “sexual jihad” with women at the protests. To support the crackdown, “you have to dehumanize them,” Professor Ghobashy said. The core of the government’s complaint with Western news media coverage is what it considers an excessive focus on the hundreds of Morsi supporters killed by police violence and an insufficient attention to the acts of violence by Morsi supporters. Angry Morsi supporters around the country have attacked and burned churches since his ouster and the crackdown; on Sunday, the government distributed a Christian newspaper’s tally of 26 churches attacked, though the number could not be confirmed independently. In the relatively lawless Sinai, a haven for Islamist militants, deadly attacks on soldiers and police officers have spiked since Mr. Morsi’s ouster. And, in the days since Wednesday’s sit-in, several Morsi supporters have been seen in Cairo carrying or firing guns in clashes with the police or their civilian backers, including during the sit-in assault. Some of the civilians fighting them were also armed. At a news conference on Sunday with the interim foreign minister, Nabil Fahmy, the government showed video footage and passed out a few photographs of Islamists in different scenes wielding guns in the clashes, and one man who wrapped a weapon in paper to hide it before he ran through the battle at the breakup of the sit-in. As the police closed in with tear gas, birdshot and sharp-point ammunition, many Morsi supporters tried to fight back by throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. The government has said more than 40 security officers were killed that day in violence around the country. Some Islamists had predicted or threatened violence over Mr. Morsi’s ouster and the crackdown. But there remains no evidence that the Muslim Brotherhood has systematically plotted violence or that the sit-ins posed a threat to other civilians. And critics of the deadly crackdown say it was disproportionate no matter who shot first. But the message from the government and news media here over the weekend was that Egyptians feel “severe bitterness” toward Western news because it is “biased toward the Muslim Brotherhood,” the government said in a printed statement summing up the news conferences. The clearing of the Islamist sit-in may have killed more than 600 people. But Mustafa Hegazy, a government spokesman, said at a news conference on Saturday that, in the face of the Brotherhood’s violence, security forces had exercised “a huge amount of self-restraint and self-control.” Advertisement"

Ironically, Jackson showed no signs of such a malady until he faced a prison sentence and the possible loss of his federal pension. Understandably, situations like Jackson’s invite outrage. But while his particular case is egregious, it is the banal forms of government corruption that are endemic in our system that should really concern us. Chief among these is what Jackson’s case illustrates: the political class is subject to a different set of laws than the rest of us. Instead of a nation based upon the idea that all citizens have equal rights before the law, politicians, bureaucrats, and their minions are regularly shown special preference. In the words of George Orwell, “some animals are more equal than others.” While some states are now liberalizing their drugs laws, America — the Land of the Free — has the highest incarceration rate in the world due to the War on Drugs. The United States’ incarceration rate has shot up 800 percent since 1980. More than half of the convicts are serving time for non-violent, usually drug related, offenses. This mass incarceration disproportionately impacts minorities. On the other hand, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both admitted to using marijuana when they were younger. In private conversations, George W. Bush hinted that he had also smoked pot. Many other high government officials are on the record as marijuana users. But that doesn’t stop them from writing, signing, and enforcing laws that ruin the lives of people — usually the poor and minorities — who are busted with marijuana. Politicians seem to think that their lives are somehow more important than the lives of the citizens they claim to serve. For instance, in the wake of the mass shooting in Tucson, AZ that critically injured Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, Congressman Peter King wanted to prohibit people from carrying guns within 1,000 feet of members of Congress. But why just members of Congress? The Giffords shooting was terrible, but 18 other people were shot in Tucson. Six of them died. Nevertheless, King’s knee jerk reaction was to address the concerns of the political class. Senator Dianne Feinstein is one of Washington’s leading gun control advocates. Feinstein once possessed a concealed carry permit because she feared for her safety. Nevertheless, today Feinstein would readily deny that right to the rest of us. Politicians talk a good game about “public service,”  but their generous salaries and lavish perks tell a different story. One of the best ways to become wealthy in America is to get elected to Congress.  This problem is not confined to Washington. Across the country, and especially in California, municipalities face fiscal calamities precipitated by exorbitant, unsustainable public sector pensions. Then there are truly mundane examples of politicians’  special treatment. For instance, I recently learned that members of the state legislature are given preferential parking privileges at the airport near my home in Tennessee. In what other business would the employees be assigned the best parking, while the ostensible bosses are expected to walk a couple hundred of yards? During the 2004 presidential campaign, John Edwards, a multi-millionaire trial lawyer, coined the phrase “two Americas” to refer to the stratification of American society along socioeconomic lines. Of course, since Edwards belonged to the privileged political class, he didn’t mention the stratification of America along the lines of political class. America is a country where people are supposed to get ahead by realizing their potential talents and putting them to use in a free market system — not where certain individuals are allowed to enjoy arbitrary advantages and privileges thanks to nothing more than who controls the reins of power. There are two Americas. One is populated by common folks who pay the bills. The other is populated by self-anointed elitists who live at our expense.

After only four hours of deliberations, the forewoman of a jury of military officers, a colonel, said that it was their unanimous verdict that 42-year-old Major Nidal Hasan should be executed. “It is my duty as president of this jury to inform you that… the court martial in closed session in a secret ballot of all members concurs to the sentences, to forfeit all pay and allowances, to dismissal from service, to be put to death,” she said. Hasan, who conducted his own defense during the trial, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Under the military justice system there is an automatic appeal in capital cases, but Hasan has made no attempt to deny the charges and court appointed defense attorneys had expressed concern that he is seeking execution. The U.S.-born Muslim of Palestinian descent is the first member of the army to receive a death sentence since the 2005 conviction of Hasan Akbar, who killed two in an attack on fellow soldiers in Kuwait in 2003. On November 5, 2009, Hasan opened fire at a medical processing facility in the sprawling Fort Hood base in Texas that serves as a staging point for soldiers to deploy to combat zones. Twelve of the dead and 30 of the wounded were soldiers. Hasan was himself shot by a civilian police officer who responded to the attack and he is now partially paralyzed. The court had heard that Hasan was opposed to the U.S. military’s occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, and that he had spoken online with an alleged Al-Qaeda figure, radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen subsequently killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen. Following the sentence, Hasan was rushed quickly out of the military courtroom, which is in Fort Hood, to be transported back to a local civilian jail where he has been held for more than three years. He is to be taken to military death row in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to await execution. Seven relatives of victims slain in the shooting showed little emotion during the sentencing after repeatedly being warned not to not make any public declarations of support or opposition to the sentence. After the court was adjourned, several relatives could be seen with tears in their eyes. One, a widow, lightly touched the face of a woman seated next to her. Know first. The opinions that matter.

	Scott Foundas The wages of sin, guilt, vengeance and redemption weigh heavy on the characters of “Prisoners,” a spellbinding, sensationally effective thriller with a complex moral center that marks a grand-slam English-lingo debut for the gifted Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve. Powered by an unusually rich, twisty script by Aaron Guzikowski (“Contraband”) and career-best performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, this tale of two Pennsylvania families searching for their kidnapped daughters sustains an almost unbearable tension for two-and-a-half hours of screen time, satisfying as both a high-end genre exercise and a searing adult drama of the sort Hollywood almost never makes anymore. Fully deserving of mention in the same breath as “Seven,” “Mystic River” and “In the Bedroom,” this Sept. 20 Warners release may prove too intense for some viewers, but should ride strong reviews and word of mouth to above-average R-rated returns. It immediately enters the ring as an awards-season heavyweight.  Though at first glance the pic would appear to have little in common with his previous work, Villeneuve has long shown an interest in the psychological and emotional consequences of violence, as evidenced by 2009’s serenely chilling, black-and-white “Polytechnique” (about a real-life Canadian mass shooting) and especially 2010’s Oscar-nominated “Incendies,” which “Prisoners” echoes in its fragmented central mystery and its theme of the good and ill transmitted from parents to children. But in every respect, the new film finds Villeneuve working on his biggest and most ambitious canvas to date and, perhaps most impressive, flawlessly catching the moods and mores of small-town, God-fearing America. The movie announces its measured, quietly confident tone right from the opening scene of a father-son deer-hunting trip, the first of many images of predators pursuing their prey. “Be ready,” says the father, Pennsylvania carpenter Keller Dover (Jackman), to the teenage boy (Dylan Minnette), a crucifix dangling from the rear-view mirror, a late autumn chill hanging in the air. Back at home, where Keller’s wife, Grace (Maria Bello), and 6-year-old daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich), safely await his return, the basement is stocked with enough emergency provisions for a nuclear holocaust. (Among other thing, “Prisoners” is very much a movie about what people have in their basements.) All the canned goods in the world, however, cannot shield the Dovers from what is about to happen next. Theirs is the kind of quaint suburban street where people walk over to the neighbor’s house for Thanksgiving dinner and feel relatively insulated from the world’s violent ills. Yet it is during just such a Thanksgiving that Anna wanders off unsupervised along with 7-year-old Joy, the daughter of family friends Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, respectively). By dessert, both have vanished without a trace. The only clue: Earlier in the day, the girls were seen playing around a camper van parked in front of a vacant house down the road, the faint sound of a radio suggesting that someone was inside, patiently watching.   Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is spending his Thanksgiving alone, flirting with the waitress in a lonely Chinese diner, when he first responds to the case. In the best film-noir manner, rain is sheeting down, and the camera of the great d.p. Roger Deakins (who has shot the film in wintry blues and blacks with an expressionist edge) pushes in slowly from behind. Loki, we are told, has never failed to solve a case, though this is at odds with the man’s solemn demeanor, his haunted gaze and the elaborate tattoos jutting out from his collar suggesting reserves of private rage. Compare this to the eager-beaver murder sleuth Gyllenhaal played in David Fincher’s “Zodiac” and the full breadth of his impressive range immediately comes into focus. The camper van is soon located along with its owner, a gangly, inarticulate man-child named Alex (played to creepy perfection by Paul Dano), who lives with his aunt (Melissa Leo) in the kind of run-down, cluttered tract house where serial killers and other movie deviants tend to reside. But awareness of such familiar tropes — and awareness of our awareness of them — is one of “Prisoners’” canny strengths. So it turns out that Alex is not the kidnapper — or at least, that there’s no physical evidence tying him to the scene — and the police are forced to let him go. Which is when Keller, who’s as sure as we are that Alex is guilty, takes matters into his own hands, abducting the suspect and chaining him up in an abandoned apartment building that belonged to his father. The movie’s tally of kidnappers now stands at two. And the puzzle of “Prisoners” has only just begun to assemble. Following a lead to the home of an elderly priest (Len Cariou), Loki discovers a rotting corpse in a hidden cellar. Then, at exactly the one-hour mark, another shifty young man appears on the scene, triggering a whole new set of suspicions. All the while, Alex sits in hock, violently tortured and interrogated by Keller (who tells his wife he’s off helping the police) in an effort to discern the girls’ whereabouts. With each successive revelation, Guzikowski’s brilliant script satisfies the necessary machinations while always flowing effortlessly from his vivid, multi-dimensional characters. That delicate balance extends to Villeneuve’s direction, which maintains a vise-like grip on the viewer without ever resorting to cheap shock effects or compromising the integrity of the human drama. Yet this is also a film that breathes, that knows it has the audience in its palm and can take time out for the kind of incidental, character-deepening scenes that usually end up on the cutting-room floor. In less assured hands, a movie called “Prisoners” with a plot like this would be an invitation to disaster, heavy on self-conscious allegory, symbolism and moral debate. (Everyone, don’t you see, is a prisoner of something — of time, of grief, of his own psyche.) In Villeneuve’s, nothing is belabored, the thorny questions of right and wrong bubbling under the surface without ever being declaimed. Jackman has simply never been better than as this true believer forced to question his beliefs. Effortlessly, the Australian actor projects a solid, rugged Americanness, the acme of a man whose home is his castle and who sees himself as his family’s protector. It is a performance void of vanity or the desire to be loved by the audience, and moment to moment it is exhilarating to watch. In just a handful of scenes each, Bello and Davis suggest the full, inexpressible weight of motherly grief. Leo, given a role rife with opportunities to ham it up, instead plays things with the sober conviction of a disappointed life, another standout in a movie with nary a squandered performance in the mix. In addition to Deakins’ stellar work, longtime Clint Eastwood editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach have done a formidable job of assembling the pic’s densely constructed narrative web. Score by Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson (also making his big-studio debut) strikes just the right haunting, mournful notes. The Business of Entertainment"

A military jury could then start deliberations Thursday in the case of Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is standing trial on charges of killing 13 people in the worst mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. Hasan is acting as his own attorney but forfeited the right to present a case. He called no witnesses and offered no new evidence, choosing instead to move straight to closing arguments. Military prosecutors produced more than 700 pieces of evidence against Hasan during the 12-day trial. Hasan said Wednesday the shooting was provoked by an ""illegal war"" and not done in the heat of passion.

He will now join five other inmates who are on military death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. None of the five are close to an execution date, and one of the inmates could have his sentence commuted to life in prison. The military courts system has not executed an active-duty soldier since 1961. Here is a look at inmates currently on death row: — Ronald A. Gray, convicted in April 1988 of several murders and rapes while stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C. — Dwight J. Loving, convicted in April 1989 of killing two cab drivers while stationed at Fort Hood. — Hasan K. Akbar, convicted in May 2005 of attacking fellow soldiers in Kuwait, killing two, during the invasion of Iraq. — Andrew Witt, convicted in October 2005 of killing a fellow airman and his wife at their home at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. An appeals court ordered his case reopened earlier this month. — Timothy Hennis, convicted in April 2010 of killing a North Carolina mother and her two children a quarter-century earlier.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Expert breaks down Fort Hood shooting trial Jurors are set to begin a second day of deliberations in the court-martial of the Army soldier charged in the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood. Maj. Nidal Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 30 others at the Texas military base in 2009. The case was given to jurors Thursday afternoon, who deliberated for about three hours before asking the judge if they could review testimony from the Fort Hood police officer who shot the gunman and ended the rampage. The judge agreed before dismissing the jurors for the night. Deliberations are scheduled to resume Friday morning. Earlier Thursday, Hasan passed on his final chance to address jurors, even after prosecutors insisted he carried out a planned attack and asked jurors for a verdict that would allow the death penalty. Hasan is acting as his own attorney but declined to plead his case after prosecutors wrapped up their closing argument. When the judge told Hasan he could begin, he said: ""The defense chooses not to make a closing statement."" Hasan is facing numerous counts of premeditated murder for the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the Army post in central Texas. It was the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military base. Prosecutors insisted there was no question that Hasan planned and carried out the attack. ""The facts I laid out to you give you only one option,"" the prosecutor, Col. Steve Henricks, told jurors. ""The accused without a doubt -- without any doubt at all -- had a premeditated design to kill."" The Army psychiatrist told jurors during a brief opening statement nearly two weeks ago that evidence would ""clearly show"" he was the shooter, and he described himself as a soldier who had ""switched sides."" But since then, he has sat mostly silent. He has raised few objections during the 13-day trial, and he questioned only three of the nearly 90 witnesses called by prosecutors. He also presented only a single piece of evidence: an evaluation from his boss that called him a good soldier. On Thursday, military prosecutors asked jurors for a unanimous conviction on the premeditated murder charges, which would allow them to seek the death penalty -- the government's priority in the case. Henricks repeatedly emphasized the word ""premeditation,"" trying to dissuade the jury -- 13 high-ranking military officers -- of even considering a conviction on a lesser charge that would take the death penalty off the table. ""There's no doubt the evidence you heard in this case shows he committed the offense,"" Henricks said. Henricks said Hasan asked for the highest-tech weapon available when he went to a gun store a few months before the Nov. 5, 2009, attack, and he soon began practicing at a gun range. Hasan also used laser sights, which Henricks said ""established intent to kill."" The prosecutor noted that the shootings, which started inside a medical building crowded with soldiers preparing to deploy, came the same day Hasan's unit was at that building. Hasan was assigned to soon join the unit in Afghanistan on a six-month tour. The last witness to testify for prosecutors had said Hasan told her shortly before the shooting, without prompting, that the Army would ""pay"" if he were ever ordered deployed overseas. ""Some things speak for themselves. It doesn't require any evidence -- because it's no coincidence -- that the accused did his crime on Five November,"" Henricks told jurors. Henricks also noted that Hasan targeted soldiers, leaving most civilians unscathed. After Hasan fled the medical building, and civilians outside asked him what was going on, ""he tells them it's a paintball gun. It's a training exercise. He's keeping his wits about him even after what happened,"" Henricks said. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, has been unapologetic about saying the rampage was necessary to protect Muslim insurgents abroad from American soldiers preparing for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. But most of his arguments have played out through leaks to the media or directly to the judge, so they couldn't be considered by the jury. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Monday, 26 August 2013 06:32 AM The Army psychiatrist convicted of the Fort Hood rampage that killed 13 people begins the sentencing phase of his trial Monday, facing a possible death sentence for the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military installation. Maj. Nidal Hasan showed no reaction after being found guilty last week by a military jury, which will now decide whether the Virginia-born Muslim who said he opened fire on unarmed American soldiers to protect insurgents abroad should be executed. Twelve of the dead were soldiers, including a pregnant private who pleaded for the unborn child's life. More than 30 others were wounded in the 2009 attack on the Texas Army post, where investigators collected more than 200 bullet casings. At minimum, the 42-year-old Hasan will spend the rest of his life in prison. ""This is where members (of the jury) decide whether you will live or whether you will die,"" Col. Tara Osborn, the trial judge, told Hasan on Friday following his conviction. She then again implored Hasan, who represented himself during the 14-day trial, to consider letting his standby attorneys take over for the sentencing phase. He declined. Jurors deliberated for about seven hours before finding Hasan guilty on all counts. He gave them virtually no alternative, as he didn't present a defense or make a closing argument, and he only questioned three of the nearly 90 witnesses called by prosecutors. His silence convinced his court-ordered standby attorneys that Hasan wants jurors to sentence him to death. Hasan told military mental health officials in 2010 that he could ""still be a martyr"" if he is executed. The sentencing phase will be Hasan's last chance to say in court what he's spent the last four years telling the military, judges and journalists: that the killing of American soldiers preparing to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan was necessary to protect Muslim insurgents. Hasan was prohibited from making a ""defense of others"" strategy during the guilt or innocence phase of his trial, but he will have more latitude during the sentencing portion. This has led legal experts and his civilian lawyer, John Galligan, to believe that Hasan could put himself on the witness stand this week. Osborn didn't ask Hasan whether he might testify following his conviction. But she did ask whether Hasan felt he had been subject to ""illegal punishment"" or been unfairly restricted since being put in custody after the shooting. He told Osborn he wasn't ready to answer. ""I'm still working on that,"" Hasan said. Prosecutors want Hasan to join just five other U.S. service members currently on military death row, and are planning to put more than a dozen grieving relatives on the witness stand. Three soldiers who survived being shot by Hasan but were left debilitated or unfit for service are also expected to testify. But most will be widows, mothers, children and siblings of the slain, who are expected to tell a jury of 13 high-ranking military officers about their loves ones and describe the pain of living the last four years without them. What they won't be allowed to talk about are their feelings toward Hasan or what punishment they think he deserves. Osborn told military prosecutors Friday to make sure their witnesses understood what topics were out of bounds. She was also considering excluding some family photos that could be considered duplicative, such as two different pictures of a victim in uniform. ""I understand the family members have memories of their loved ones,"" Osborn said. ""But that's not part of the ruling I must make in a court of law."" Jurors must be unanimous to sentence him to death. No American soldier has been executed since 1961. Many military death row inmates have had their sentences overturned on appeal, which are automatic when jurors vote for the death penalty. The U.S. president must eventually approve a military death sentence. ___ © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

825791320,2013-08-15 00:00:00,Poll: Gun Control Vote Boosted Red State Dems,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/poll-gun-control-vote-boosted-red-state-dems,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,elections,public opinion,gun control,firearms",113,Talking Points Memo,http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com,"By supporting a measure that would have expanded background checks on gun buyers, Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Kay Hagan (D-NC) appear to have found a way to please both fellow Democrats and their red state constituents. The latest survey released Thursday by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling showed that Landrieu and Hagan actually bolstered their re-election prospects by supporting the background checks legislation. Facing potentially difficult races next year in a pair of states that were carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, Landrieu and Hagan were two of the final Democrats to ultimately pledge support for the measure, which ultimate failed in the Senate last month. Four other red state Democrats joined most Republicans to vote against the legislation. But PPP’s findings, the latest in the firm’s ongoing effort to gauge reaction to the gun bill, suggested that the votes will be more of an advantage than a disadvantage for Landrieu and Hagan. In Louisiana, the poll found that 71 percent of voters support “requiring background checks for all gun sales, including gun shows and the Internet.” Forty-four percent of voters there said they are more likely to back Landrieu in 2014 as a result of her vote. Meanwhile, just a little more than a quarter said they are less likely to support her. Another 29 percent said her vote will make no difference on whether they support Landrieu for re-election. Conversely, Landrieu’s Republican colleague from Louisiana, Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), earned low marks for his opposition to the background checks measure. The poll showed that 40 percent of voters are less likely to support Vitter, who will be up for re-election in 2016. An overwhelming majority of Hagan’s constituents in North Carolina — 73 percent — are also in favor of expanding background checks. Fifty-two percent of Tar Heel State voters said they are now more likely to vote for Hagan in 2014 because she supported the bipartisan Senate bill. And much like in Louisiana, Hagan’s Republican counterpart may have committed a political pratfall by opposing the bill. Half of North Carolina voters said they are now less likely to support Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) as a result of his “no” on the background checks legislation. Burr will be up for re-election in 2016. PPP has tracked the public’s attitudes toward the gun bill since it fizzled in the Senate. The firm released another poll last week showing Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) facing a sizable backlash in New Hampshire over her “no” vote. At a town hall meeting on Tuesday, Ayotte was confronted by the daughter of a woman who was killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. PPP released a larger poll earlier this week showing similar blowback for five other senators who also opposed the measure, including Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), whose approval rating fell to 32 percent after the vote. Meanwhile, a poll from Quinnipiac University showed that Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), one of the co-authors of the background checks legislation, drew a bounce at home for his efforts on the bill.

The military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, cleared the court Wednesday morning so she could conduct a closed hearing on the matter. The trial in the 2009 shooting that left 13 people dead and 31 wounded is scheduled to resume Thursday morning. It remains to be seen how the motion filed by Lt. Col Kris Poppe and two other lawyers on Hasan's standby counsel will impact the high-profile trial. Poppe, Hasan's former lead defense attorney, has long expressed misgivings about the role of his team since Hasan sought to represent himself earlier this year. In a discussion outside the jury's presence, Poppe told the judge it became clear when testimony began Tuesday that Hasan was attempting to remove obstacles to the death penalty — something the standby defense team found “repugnant.” He said Hasan, who has seldom raised objections or questioned witnesses or prospective jury members, has been “engaging to working toward the death penalty.” That statement drew a defiant reaction from Hasan, who is serving as his own attorney, with the standby counsel team present. “Your honor, I object. That's a twist of the facts,” Hasan said. Poppe said the jury selection process was “wholly inadequate.” But Hasan denied that he's trying to improve the prosecution's chances of having a conviction and death sentence unanimously approved by the jury. “Your honor, Col. Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate,” he said. “It's inaccurate, and I'd like to clarify that.” The judge then cleared the courtroom. She later recessed court until Thursday. Osborn, who had said she intended to begin testimony on time and keep the trial moving forward, said she received the motion “late last night” and has also received four attachments, including an unspecified “Fox News media report.” Col. Michael Mulligan, lead attorney for the government, said he was “concerned with the body of the motion.” The judge ordered the motion and its attachments sealed. Osborn said she was “confused” by the motion and its intent. She asked Poppe if he and the other members of the standby counsel, Lt. Col. Christopher E. Martin and Maj. Joseph T. Marcee, wanted to continue to be involved in the case at all. “The motion seems to be at war with itself, Col. Poppe,” she said. Poppe said he, Martin and Marcee are willing to assist Hasan “if he's ready to fight the death penalty,” but does not want to be forced to participate in a trial spectacle that is “repugnant to defense counsel.” Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the worst shooting of its kind on a U.S. military base. The attempted premeditated murder charges relate to 31 people who were wounded and a contract police officer, Mark Todd, who came under fire by the shooter. Hasan, if convicted, could get the death penalty or life in prison. Texas Tech University law school professor Richard Rosen, a retired Army colonel, said it wasn't clear what Poppe was seeking. Defense attorneys in the role of standby counsel conduct research for the accused, and may or may not provide legal advice. They also can return as full-fledged defense attorneys at the defendant's request. Rosen said it was clear that Poppe and his team are wrestling with a supreme ethical dilemma. ""I think he's concerned about the fact that his client wants the death penalty, at least that's what I understood form what I heard,"" said Rosen, a former Army lawyer who is sitting in on the proceedings here. ""And he thinks it's ethically improper for him to serve as a standby counsel for someone who's seeking the death penalty when his role should be to ensure that he does not get the death penalty,"" said Rosen, a former deputy legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Asked if the issue had been a problem in past military trials, Rosen said, ""I've never seen anything like this in 26 years on active duty.""

Reporters are not allowed to use recording devices in the courtroom, or in a remote location where a live, closed-circuit television feed provides audio of the testimony and courtroom discussion, and visual images of the military judge and witnesses who testify. Eleven seats are set aside in the courtroom gallery for credentialed media under a “pool” system that provides access for news wire and local, regional and national print, radio and television journalists. Osborn, noting a full gallery Tuesday that included victims' family members, said before the jury entered the courtroom that in spite of the powerful emotions of the trial, outward expressions of joy, sadness, anger or other feelings would not be tolerated in court. “Spectators will remain silent during all proceedings,” Osborn said. “We're going to carry on in a calm, quiet and dignified manner.” Thomas Rheinlander, Fort Hood public affairs officer, said the media ground rules are aimed at achieving a delicate balance between access to the trial and security concerns.

But I have a hard time not doing that in this case.  Many of you have kids.  I have kids.  These school shootings, a subset of the no less horific mass shooting phenomenon, seem like they’re becoming more common (though I’d be curious to hear whether there are hard statistics on this.)  But this one seems, feels like it’s in a whole different category — the age of the children, the number of fatalities.  I’m not sure any of that requires saying more.  You get it. In this case, I read a couple days ago that there are some 300 million guns in the US.  Just under half the population owns a firearm.  Let’s assume some truly radical shift in public opinion in the country and new regulations and laws get that number down to 200 million.  What does that accomplish exactly? And let’s further note that the courts have moved decisively in favor of a much fuller interpretation of the 2nd Amendment which would make almost any sort of serious gun control impossible.  Just days ago a federal court essentially made ‘conceal and carry’ the law of the land, or at least within that circuit for now.  So what seemed a bit crazy a few years ago is now a constitutionally protected gun right. We know many cases of schools where people have to go through metal detectors.  How much more on permanent lockdown do we want schools to be?  Let’s call that half a rhetorical question.  But only half. Don’t mistake me: I’m not making the argument that gun control wouldn’t be effective or the standard arguments that the guns were bought legally or by people with no history mental illness, whatever. I’d be ready to support pretty much all the things that normally go under the heading of ‘gun control’.  But I’m hearing a lot of people saying we need to talk about guns, restart that conversation.  And I agree, at least in the abstract.  But what exactly are we talking about?  And how we propose to get from here to there?  How do we make our country less of a moral embarrassment. I don’t want to hear about these tragedies being rooted in evil or the human heart.  We know the human heart is a substandard product.  The brain frequently malfunctions.  It’s offensive to put this forward as part of a discussion about policy as opposed to theodicy and meditation.  We know that the vast, vast proportion of gun owners use them legally and safely.  We also know that gun deaths are rare in many other countries quite similar to the USA for the simple reason they don’t have so many friggin’ guns all over the place.  This is obvious.  And guns just make it easy to kill a lot of people really quickly.  Freely available body armor helps too. I’m not trying to stop the discussion.  I want to start it.  But I’m looking for some guidance on how it can be about more than words. My colleague Nicole Lafond already discussed this in the post immediately below this one. But it’s so bizarre I simply… Let’s go back in time for a minute. Back when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was putting together a panel… A new episode of The Josh Marshall Podcast is live!

Cerberus Capital Management, which counts former Vice President Dan Quayle among its executives, said in a statement Tuesday that it plans to sell its stake in Freedom Group, the parent company of some of the biggest names in firearms, including Bushmaster, the manufacturer of the rifle used to kill 27 people, including 20 first graders, in Friday’s massacre. In its statement, Cerberus said, “We do not believe that Freedom Group or any single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition.” But, the company added: “It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level.” “As a Firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,” the company said. “Our role is to make investments on behalf of our clients who are comprised of the pension plans of firemen, teachers, policemen and other municipal workers and unions, endowments, and other institutions and individuals. It is not our role to take positions, or attempt to shape or influence the gun control policy debate. That is the job of our federal and state legislators… There are, however, actions that we as a firm can take. Accordingly, we have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group.” In the statement, the company also pointed out that it does not sell weapons or ammunition directly to consumers, “through gun shows or otherwise.” According to The New York Times, Cerberus acquired Bushmaster in 2006, and later merged it with other manufacturers, including Remington and DPMS Firearms, to create Freedom Group. For the nine months that ended in September 2012, Freedom Group reported net sales of $677.3 million. Just last year, Cerberus and Freedom Group were the subjects of a big feature in the Times, which called Freedom Group “the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today.” “We believe our scale and product breadth are unmatched within the industry,” Freedom Group said in a 2010 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the 12 months that ended in March 2010, Freedom Group sold 1.2 million long guns and 2.6 billion rounds of ammunition, according to the Times. The company snapped up so many gunmakers so quickly, it inspired conspiracy theories. According to one rumor, Freedom Group was secretly run by the liberal billionaire George Soros, who was acquiring gun companies so he could shut down the industry. But Cerberus is less mysterious than that. With headquarters on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, offices all over the world, and more than $20 billion under management, the company bills itself as “one of the world’s leading private investment firms.” Among the company’s leadership are co-founder and CEO Stephen Feinberg and Quayle, the chairman of the company’s global investments arm. On Monday, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-largest pension fund in the U.S., told Reuters it was reviewing its investment in Cerberus. “At this point our investment branch is examining the Cerberus investment to determine how best to move forward given the tragic events of last Friday in Newtown, Connecticut,” a spokesman for CalSTRS said. Read Cerberus’ full statement: We were shocked and deeply saddened by the events that took place at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT on December 14, 2012.  We cannot comprehend the losses suffered by the families and friends of those killed by the unthinkable crimes committed that day.  No words or actions can lessen the enormity of this event or make a dent in the pain that was inflicted on so many. In 2006 affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. made a financial investment in Freedom Group.  Freedom Group does not sell weapons or ammunition directly to consumers, through gun shows or otherwise.  Sales are made only to federally licensed firearms dealers and distributors in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  We do not believe that Freedom Group or any single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition. It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level.  The debate essentially focuses on the balance between public safety and the scope of the Constitutional rights under the Second Amendment.  As a Firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers.  Our role is to make investments on behalf of our clients who are comprised of the pension plans of firemen, teachers, policemen and other municipal workers and unions, endowments, and other institutions and individuals.  It is not our role to take positions, or attempt to shape or influence the gun control policy debate.  That is the job of our federal and state legislators. There are, however, actions that we as a firm can take.  Accordingly, we have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group.  We will retain a financial advisor to design and execute a process to sell our interests in Freedom Group, and we will then return that capital to our investors.  We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and communities impacted by this tragic and devastating event. About Cerberus Capital Management, L.P.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. July 11, 2013: Practice air-powered handguns sit on a teacher's desk in a classroom at Clarksville High School in Clarksville, Ark. (AP) Are people safer if criminals know who is carrying concealed handguns? Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel seems to think so. With school starting soon, he claims that if the Clarksville, Arkansas School District lets employees carry concealed handguns at school, their names must be made public. This is his second attempt to derail the school district’s proposal. McDaniel’s demand to publicize the names will greatly limit the protection these employees can offer. School shooters have a strategic advantage in that they determine when and where to attack. The alternative of hiring uniformed armed guards is not only costly, with one armed guard costing more than the cost of training and equipping over 20 employees, but also relatively ineffective as they are usually the first victims shot (e.g., see here and here). [pullquote] The benefit of letting some unknown teachers, staff and administrators carry concealed handgun is that the killers don't know who to attack first. Publicizing their names might intimidate employees and lead them to decide not to participate in the program. McDaniel has already gone to some tortured extremes in fighting against the Clarksville School District's plan. As the state's attorney general, he is often asked to interpret the state's laws. In this case, he claims that while private businesses can hire armed guards, a public entity such as a school district doesn't have the same power. However debatable that is, there are other parts of the law that clearly deal with government entities. For example, local government entities, such as school districts, can deputize individuals. The issue is similar to what happened last year with the Journal News, a newspaper in New York State. The paper garnered national attention when it published the names of people with gun permits. The issue isn't just about privacy, as McDaniel wants to argue, it is also a safety issue. By revealing the names of permit holders, the newspaper effectively told criminals what homes had no armed defense. Indeed, when editors of the paper were asked by documentary filmaker and activist James O'Keefe if they would put signs in front of their homes saying that they were ""gun free,"" they understood it would make them targets of criminals. In order to prevent similar problems earlier this year, Arkansas passed a law banning the release of the names and zip codes of permit holders. McDaniel argues: ""Given the unusual duties and responsibilities the school district intended to assign to the [Emergency Response Team] members, I must conclude that knowing the number of [Emergency Response Teams] members and their identities would shed great light on the school district's performance of its duties. In my opinion, though the privacy interest is weighty, the public's interest is at least as weighty, which means that the record must be disclosed."" But the program is easy to evaluate without making the names public. If guns are ever misused, that would surely instantly get media attention. Indeed, the idea in Clarksville, Arkansas is hardly new. Before the 1995 Gun Free School Zone Act, most states allowing concealed carry let permit holders carry guns in schools. In four states, they still can. Some school districts in other states, such as Ohio and Texas, do the same. No problems have ever been reported. The Attorney General is also going against the trend in his own state in another way. Arkansas has recently allowed churches to determine themselves whether concealed handgun permit holders will be allowed to bring their guns with them. Law-abiding citizens, not criminals, obey these bans. Instead of making places safer, disarming law abiding citizens left them sitting ducks. Attackers go where victims can't defend themselves. In the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting, out of seven theaters showing the ""Batman"" movie premiere within 20 minutes of the suspect's apartment, only one theater banned permitted concealed handguns. Suspect James Holmes didn't go to the closest nor the largest movie theater but to the one that banned self-defense. Time after time the story is the same. With just two exceptions, every public mass shooting in the United States since at least 1950 has taken place where citizens were banned from carrying guns. Despite strict gun regulations, Europe has had three of the worst four K-12 public school shootings. Sometimes, permit holders save lives. Joel Merck, an assistant high school principal in Pearl, Miss., used to carry his permitted handgun at school, but stopped after the 1995 act passed. When his school was attacked in October 1997, he ran a mile to get his gun stored off school property, and still stopped the attack 11 minutes before police arrived. Before 1996, he could have stopped it sooner. Ask yourself: Would you feel safer with a sign on the side of your home declaring that ""this house is a gun-free zone""? If you wouldn't put these signs on your home, why put them elsewhere? Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.

In rapid succession, a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for gun buyers, a ban on assault weapons and a ban on high-capacity gun magazines all failed to get the 60 votes needed under an agreement between both parties. Senators also turned back Republican proposals to expand permission to carry concealed weapons and to focus law enforcement efforts on prosecuting gun crimes. Sitting in the Senate gallery with other survivors of recent mass shootings and their family members, Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, and Patricia Maisch, a survivor of the mass shooting in Arizona, shouted together, “Shame on you.” President Obama, speaking at the White House after the votes, echoed the cry, calling Wednesday “a pretty shameful day for Washington.” Opponents of gun control from both parties said that they made their decisions based on logic, and that passions had no place in the making of momentous policy. “Criminals do not submit to background checks now,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. “They will not submit to expanded background checks.” It was a striking defeat for one of Mr. Obama’s highest priorities, on an issue that has consumed much of the country since Adam Lanza opened fire with an assault weapon in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. Faced with a decision either to remove substantial new gun restrictions from the bill or to allow it to fall to a filibuster next week, Senate leaders plan to put it on hold after a scattering of votes Thursday. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a longtime gun rights advocate who had thrown himself behind the gun control measures, is expected to pull the bill from the Senate floor and move on to an Internet sales tax measure, then an overhaul of immigration policy, which has better prospects. More than 50 senators — including a few Republicans, but lacking a handful of Democrats from more conservative states — had signaled their support for the gun bill, not enough to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. Democratic leadership aides said the effort could be revived if a public groundswell demanded it. “The world is watching the United States Senate, and we will be held accountable,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who helped lead the gun control effort. But with the families of Sandy Hook students in the Senate gallery and a flurry of gun rights phone calls flooding Senate offices, it was hard to imagine how much more emotion could be brought to bear. Aides to senators supporting the bill said that only outside circumstances, like another mass shooting, might cause those who voted “no” to reconsider their positions. “It’s almost like you can see the finish line, but you just can’t get there,” said Andrew Goddard, whose son, Colin, was hurt but survived the shooting at Virginia Tech. “It’s more annoying to be able to see it and not get to it.”  8 Photos View Slide Show › Mr. Obama — who avoided the gun issue in his first term and focused on proposals he thought had a better chance of passing, only to seize on expansive measures after the Newtown shootings — made last-ditch appeals to senators, including Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. Both rejected his entreaties. Standing in the Rose Garden next to former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and other victims of gun violence, Mr. Obama flashed anger as he said that the gun rights lobby had “willfully lied” about the legislation, and that Republicans and Democrats had “caved to the pressure.” “But,” he added, “this effort is not over.” For now, the gun rights lobby has proved more persuasive. The National Rifle Association mobilized members to blanket the Senate with phone calls, e-mails and letters. The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said. The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage. Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.” The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014. Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.” The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against. Even a bipartisan amendment to impose stiff penalties on gun traffickers, which was supported by the N.R.A. and expected to be adopted by voice vote, instead was defeated, receiving 58 votes, as the partisan lines hardened. The successive defeats left senators on both sides of the issue dazed and disappointed. Mr. Begich said the Senate could have united behind measures with broad support, like strengthening the existing background check system with more data about would-be gun buyers who have been deemed mentally ill, rather than expanding the checks to sales not now covered. Mr. Begich also cited bolstering school safety, criminalizing gun trafficking and improving mental health programs. “That’s a lot,” he said. “Is it perfect? No. But it’s a lot.” Those modest steps, however, were sacrificed because other Democrats did not want to see further-reaching provisions fail at the expense of a package that the gun rights lobby wanted, aides said.

Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) plans to introduce legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, his office said in a statement to TPM Monday. Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner allegedly used a high-capacity magazine in the shooting that killed a federal judge and five others and severally wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). Lautenberg is working with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) on the legislation, his office said. “The only reason to have 33 bullets loaded in a handgun is to kill a lot of people very quickly,” Lautenberg said. “These high-capacity clips simply should not be on the market. Before 2004, these ammunition clips were banned, and they must be banned again. When the Senate returns to Washington, I will introduce legislation to prohibit this type of high-capacity clip.” High-capacity ammunition magazines were illegal under the Federal Assault Weapons Ban from 1994 to 2004. Lautenberg’s bill, which will be introduced when the Senate returns to session in two weeks, would ban ammunition clips “that have a capacity of, or that could be readily converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition,” according to a press release. Lautenberg’s office said in the release that if Loughner “did not have access to the high-capacity magazine that he used, it may have prevented some of the other deaths and injuries that occurred.” Attorney General Eric Holder supported the federal gun ban back in the spring of 2009, but later backed off after resistance from the gun lobby. Spokesmen from the Justice Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the administration’s position on Lautenberg’s proposal. Here’s video of Holder speaking about the assault weapons ban at his confirmation hearing. Former President Trump’s new social network may only have thirty days to live.
