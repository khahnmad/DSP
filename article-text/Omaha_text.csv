607301040,2007-12-20 16:22:58,Trojan Horse Gun Control: The NRA Wins on the NICS Bill | The Huffington Post,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-sugarmann/trojan-horse-gun-control-_b_77754.html,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Executive Director, Violence Policy Center Last night Congress passed the ""NICS Improvement Act,"" a bill that in prior incarnations was designed to improve the records available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)--the national system used to screen gun buyers. Much has been made of the bill's bi-partisan, triangulating support: Democrats! Republicans! The National Rifle Association! The Brady Campaign! Beyond this cheery bon temps, little public attention has been paid to what the bill actually does beyond its title. And that's because if you start looking at the details of the bill--especially after NRA-backed changes made by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn--it becomes clear that the measure is nothing less than a pro-gun Trojan Horse. That's why my organization, the Violence Policy Center, and other national gun control groups, have voiced their strong concerns about the version of the bill that was passed by Congress. Concerns that have been validated by none other than the NRA which, after the bill's passage issued a press release which crowed: ""After months of careful negotiation, pro-gun legislation was passed through Congress today. The National Rifle Association (NRA) worked closely with Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) to address his concerns regarding H.R. 2640, the National Instant Check System (NICS) Improvement Act. These changes make a good bill even better. The end product is a win for American gun owners. Late yesterday, anti-gun Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), failed to delay progress of this pro-gun measure. The Violence Policy Center, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and other gun control and gun ban groups are opposed to the passage of this legislation because of the many pro-gun improvements contained within."" So why's the NRA so in thrall with an alleged gun control bill? Here are some of the reasons why. The bill would resuscitate a failed government program that spent millions of dollars annually to allow persons prohibited from buying guns to regain the ability to legally acquire firearms. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be required to establish a ""relief from disability"" program to allow persons now prohibited from possessing a firearm because they have ""been adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution"" to apply to have their bar on firearms possession removed. As a result of the bill, more than 116,000 individuals would be eligible to apply. States would also be required to establish such ""relief"" programs to restore the gun privileges of those with mental health disabilities in order to be eligible for potential grant money to upgrade records submitted to the NICS. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) used to run a similar program that, in addition to those with mental disabilities, even allowed felons to apply for ""relief."" Annual costs for the ATF program ballooned to more than $4 million in 1991, with an average cost of $4,800 per applicant and 43 full-time employees dedicated to processing the applications. Congress shut down the ATF program in 1992 because of its high cost, inefficiency, and threat to public safety (among those re-armed with your tax dollars: kidnappers, rapists, and terrorists). The bill also sets an arbitrary time limit for the VA to act on applications for ""relief."" If the agency fails to act within 365 days, applicants can file a lawsuit asking a court to restore their gun privileges--even if Congress fails to provide the VA with the appropriate resources to process these investigations. Some prevailing applicants would be entitled to attorneys' fees. This provision is contrary to a unanimous 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ATF's failure to act on a relief application from a felon (because of a lack of appropriations) did not constitute a denial that would entitle the applicant to judicial review. The decision noted that courts are ill-equipped to make decisions on individual applications for ""relief"" under the standards that would apply under the ""NICS Improvement Act,"" stating: ""Whether an applicant is `likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety' presupposes an inquiry into that applicant's background--a function best performed by the Executive, which, unlike courts, is institutionally equipped for conducting a neutral, wide-ranging investigation. Similarly, the `public interest' standard calls for an inherently policy-based decision best left in the hands of an agency."" The bill significantly narrows the category of records of people with mental disabilities that would be submitted to the NICS by the federal government. The current permanent bar on persons with certain mental health disabilities would be replaced with temporary restrictions. Once a solution, the bill--hijacked by the gun lobby--is now part of the problem. Intended as Congress' response to the mass shooting at Virginia Tech by focusing on improving the current laws prohibiting people with certain mental health disabilities from buying guns, the bill is now nothing more than a gun lobby wish list. It will waste millions of taxpayer dollars restoring the gun privileges of persons previously determined to present a danger to themselves or others. Yes, the bill does authorize $200 million dollars a year for five years to improve the submission of mental health records to the NICS (even the Brady law, authorized at the same level, has never come anywhere near such a level of actual funding). But does anyone really believe that the NRA is going to lobby the appropriations committees to fully fund the measure? They'll be spending their time ensuring that there's just enough money to fund the components of the bill they really care about--like the federal and state ""relief from disability"" programs--and that no one else seems to want to talk about. The bottom line: the known ""bad"" in this bill far outweighs the hoped-for ""good."" The concerns over these aspects of the bill are not abstract. According to research published earlier this year, male U.S. veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide as men with no military service and are more likely to kill themselves with a gun than others who commit suicide. The men with a military background were 58 percent more likely to have used a firearm to kill themselves than non-veterans who committed suicide. Add to this the fact that veterans are more likely to own guns than the general population. Veterans with mental health problems may present special risks for gun violence. In 2000, the New York Times examined 100 rampage shootings and found that the majority (52 percent) of such killers had been in the military. The Times' review also found that 47 percent of rampage killers had a history of mental problems, with 42 percent having been seen by mental health professionals. When the inevitable tragedies occur as a result of this bill, and veterans with mental health disabilities--given guns instead of help--turn these weapons on themselves, their families, or the public, the inevitable question will be, ""How did this happen?"" When that question is asked, who will be willing to answer it? Executive Director, Violence Policy Center"

Newtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on Web Dec. 17, 2012 — -- Not even a national tragedy is safe from social media tomfoolery and hoaxes. After the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. on Friday, which left 20 children and six adults dead, most of the people who took to Twitter and Facebook were there to share their sympathies and discuss political action. But some took to creating some online disruption -- they created fake Twitter, YouTube and Facebook profiles appearing to be Adam Lanza, the shooter, and his brother Ryan. Many of the accounts have been disabled by Twitter and other services, but some still exist. For instance, as of Monday afternoon, there were a few Adam Lanza accounts on Twitter. One's description said ""Murder for Hire"" while another said, ""My Name is Adam Lanza and I'm from Newtown, CT. I hate Kids."" MORE: Mass Newtown Shooting Sparks Mass Social Media Action At a press conference Sunday, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance addressed the issue. ""Misinformation is being posted on social media sites,"" Vance said. ""There has been misinformation coming from people posing as the shooter in this case, using other IDs, mimicking this crime, crime scene and criminal activity that took place in this community."" Vance said, ""It is important to note that we have discussed with federal authorities that these issues are crimes, they will be investigated statewide and federally, and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified."" Vance did not specify which accounts were in question and what messages specifically had been shared. Twitter wouldn't comment on which accounts had been taken down, but it did point us to its policy on parody or fan accounts. ""Twitter users are allowed to create parody, commentary, or fan accounts (including role-playing),"" Twitter's policy says, but there are a number of rules. ""In order to avoid impersonation, an account's profile information should make it clear that the creator of the account is not actually the same person or entity as the subject of the parody/commentary."" It also says, ""Accounts with a clear intent to deceive may be permanently suspended."" However, impersonating might not be the crime here. ""There are only a handful of states that have laws against impersonation,"" Brad Shear, a Washington, D.C.-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, told ABC News. Instead, he said, it's the content of those tweets or messages that could very well be considered illegal -- if, for instance, they include a specific online threat, use one's identity for financial gain, or intentionally impeding a police investigation, Shear said. But absent one of those, he concluded, ""it would be difficult for the authorities to prosecute."" In addition to the Adam Lanza impersonators, actor Morgan Freeman was impersonated in a message that went viral on Facebook.  A message attributed to Freeman, which criticized news media for treating past shooters ""like celebrities,"" was circulated on Facebook along with a photo of Freeman. ""Morgan neither wrote, posted or had any knowledge of this whatsoever ever,"" Freeman's rep told ABC News today. The question of why some post and spread fake information on the Internet is a question, perhaps, as old as the Internet. But Pamela Rutledge, a director of the Media Psychology Program at Fielding Graduate University and UCLA Extension, said that in these situations it could have a deeper meaning. ""Even those who used social media to spread false information, we could argue, are using this as a coping method to feel some sort of power or agency in the face of the powerlessness we all feel."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

RICHMOND, Jan. 23 -- A bill that would have restricted certain gun sales in Virginia and that had received passionate support from survivors of the Virginia Tech massacre was defeated by a Senate committee Wednesday, ending the major gun control effort of this year's General Assembly session.


The legislation had failed repeatedly over the years but had taken on a greater urgency this year because of the April 16 shootings. Supporters had said this year was their best chance of winning approval because of the Virginia Tech tragedy, and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) had made it a priority.


But Republicans and rural Democrats on the Senate Courts of Justice Committee teamed up to reject the bill, which would have required background checks for buyers at gun shows. Sens. Richard L. Saslaw, Janet D. Howell and Linda T. ""Toddy"" Puller, Fairfax County Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, and Sen. Ken Cuccinelli II, a Fairfax Republican, voted against it.


Under current law, only people who buy guns from licensed dealers must be checked through the federal database that identifies convicted felons and others deemed a danger to the community. Between 22 percent and 35 percent of gun show vendors do not have licenses, Virginia State Police say.


For Kaine, the vote was a setback especially because the Senate is controlled by his party. When the House defeated the bill last week, Kaine asserted that the effort was not over. But neither he nor others could overcome the power of the state's gun lobby and Virginia's historic support of gun rights.


A spokesman for Kaine said the governor was disappointed by Wednesday's vote.


""He has said many times that either you believe a felon should be able to buy a gun or you don't,"" spokesman Gordon Hickey said. ""This vote indicates that some believe a felon should be able to buy a gun at a gun show.""


Gun rights groups had opposed the bill, saying that Seung Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech student who shot and killed 32 people and then himself, did not buy the two semiautomatic weapons he used in the shootings at a gun show. Gun control advocates, however, said it would close a loophole in state law that could allow convicted felons and other dangerous individuals to buy guns and commit similar crimes.


""It's a complete and utter outrage,"" said Abigail Spangler, founder of the Alexandria-based http://ProtestEasyGuns.com, which had lobbied for the bill. ""I'm offended on behalf of all Virginians in this year of our tragedy, when we lost our fellow Virginians in the largest mass shooting in Virginia history.""


Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath), who generally opposes gun restrictions, had proposed a compromise, which he said was inspired by emotional testimony from Virginia Tech families.


""I've never voted for legislation like this before, but I think it's important that in the end, we respond in some fashion to the tragedy at Virginia Tech,"" Deeds said.


Under the compromise, anyone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon would have been exempted from a background check, as would those who were buying antique guns. In addition, the requirement would not apply to gun sales that take place in parking lots outside the leased area of the gun show.


But Deed's proposal did not persuade the 15-member committee's seven Republicans to change their minds. Nor did it sway two rural Democrats, including John S. Edwards of Roanoke, whose district includes Virginia Tech. The panel voted to send the issue to the Virginia Crime Commission, an advisory board that would craft a recommendation for a future legislative session.


""I think the Crime Commission can look at the details of this and try to work out some of the complexities,"" Edwards said.


The vote came as a relief to gun rights advocates, who had urged lawmakers to set aside their emotions over the Virginia Tech tragedy and reject the bill on its merits. They argued that it would have hurt business at gun shows and put too much responsibility on the backs of unlicensed sellers, who often are private citizens who sell guns occasionally.


Moreover, they said, it would have hindered their constitutional right to bear arms.


""If I own a piece of property, I am free to sell it. This would have gotten in the way of that,"" said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League.


Sen. Henry L. Marsh III (D-Richmond) was visibly upset that the bill was rejected this year as it had been several times before. He voted against sending it to the Crime Commission, saying it was a ""burying ground"" for the legislation.


But the decision to continue to study the issue heartened Andrew Goddard, whose son, Colin Goddard, was shot four times by Cho but survived.


""I know in my heart we are on the side of right here, and we will overcome eventually,"" said Goddard of Henrico County. ""I feel confident that the people of Virginia have the will to do this one day.""

          / CBS News Updated at 12:00 p.m. ET Tuesday with clarification on the weapons found at the scene. (CBS News) Aaron Alexis, who was identified as the alleged gunman who died in Monday's deadly mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in the nation's capital, joined the Navy Reserves in May 2007, one day before his 28th birthday. He then spent four years working as an aviation electrician's mate, most recently at the naval air station in Fort Worth, Texas. Military records show ""a pattern of misconduct,"" though in January 2011 Alexis received an honorable discharge. After leaving the service, Alexis worked as a defense contractor, and sources say he spent some time working at the Navy Yard where the shootings played out. Alexis maintained a secret clearance from his work with the Navy.  (Watch CBS News senior correspondent John Miller discuss the investigation) Police records also show Alexis had been involved in two minor shooting incidents before. He was arrested in Seattle back in 2004 for shooting out another man's tires. He was arrested again in Texas in 2010 for firing a weapon into the ceiling of his apartment. He was not prosecuted in either of those cases. Alexis also apparently was not a big presence on social networking sites, and sources say so far they cannot connect him in any way to any known threats or terror groups. But the motive for the shootings remains unknown. Investigators believe he carried out the attack with a shotgun, and apparently acquired one, possibly two, handguns during the incident. Law enforcement sources said Monday that an assault rifle was found at the scene, but authorities said Tuesday they did not believe Alexis used an assault rifle in the attack. He worked his way to the third and fourth floors of a building, which then looked down on an open atrium. Sources say with that assault rifle, which is believed to be an AR-15, Alexis essentially was a sniper, able to easily target his victims from a very high vantage point. He fired a large number of shots in a relatively confined area. Investigators are working to trace the weapons. They're also mapping the trajectory of the shots to better understand exactly how the assault played out. The FBI is looking for help to learn more about Alexis. They've put out a poster asking anyone with information to telephone 1-800-CALL-FBI. The poster is emblematic of how little they have about Alexis' motive in the investigation. If you look at the idea that they have run through all of their traps and databases and they see Alexis doesn't turn up in any significant investigations and isn't mentioned in any terrorism probes, then they're still stuck on what's the possible motive.

661510333,2008-03-05 07:00:00,Arizona Weighs Bill to Allow Guns on Campuses,http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/us/05guns.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print,en,False,"education and schools,politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,colleges and universities,gun control,firearms",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Randal C. Archibold PHOENIX  Horrified by recent campus shootings, a state lawmaker here has come up with a proposal in keeping with the Taurus .22-caliber pistol tucked in her purse: Get more guns on campus. The lawmaker, State Senator Karen S. Johnson, has sponsored a bill, which the Senate Judiciary Committee approved last week, that would allow people with a concealed weapons permit  limited to those 21 and older here  to carry their firearms at public colleges and universities. Concealed weapons are generally not permitted at most public establishments, including colleges. Ms. Johnson, a Republican from Mesa, said she believed that the recent carnage at Northern Illinois University could have been prevented or limited if an armed student or professor had intercepted the gunman. The police, she said, respond too slowly to such incidents and, besides, who better than the people staring down the barrel to take action? She initially wanted her bill to cover all public schools, kindergarten and up, but other lawmakers convinced her it stood a better chance of passing if it were limited to higher education. “I feel like our kindergartners are sitting there like sitting ducks,” Ms. Johnson said last week when the bill passed the committee by a 4-to-3 vote. This is a generally gun-friendly state, where people are allowed to carry a weapon on their hip without a permit as long as people can see it. Even so, Ms. Johnson acknowledges that her views come from the far right  she recently described herself, half-jokingly, she says, as a “right-wing wacko.” Still, the proposal has troubled advocates of gun control here and elsewhere because it appears to be gaining popularity and has fed long-smoldering debates over restrictions on carrying firearms. Since the Virginia Tech killings last April, other states have weighed similar legislation, to the disbelief of opponents, who note that the odds of lethal attacks are small, despite the publicity they attract. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a Washington nonprofit organization, said 15 states were considering legislation that would authorize or make it easier for people to carry guns on school or college campuses under certain conditions. Those states include Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Virginia, according to the center, but it considers the Arizona proposal particularly egregious because it would not only allow students and faculty to carry such weapons, but staff members as well. Utah, the organization said, is the only state with a law that expressly allows people with a concealed-weapon permit to carry guns on college campuses. That law, adopted in 2004 and upheld by Utah’s Supreme Court in 2006, arose out of concern that a state law allowing concealed weapons was not being enforced on college campuses. The critics of such laws predict that they would cause more problems, including making it hard for the police to sort a dangerous gunman from a crowd of others with guns. They also argue that the guns would make it easier for people barely out of adolescence, or perhaps emotionally troubled, to respond lethally to typical campus frustrations like poor grades or failed romances. Fred Boice, president of the Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees the state’s three public universities, said he sympathized with people concerned about campus safety. In October 2002, a nursing student at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was failing his classes shot and killed three professors before killing himself. But Mr. Boice said he believed security and a system of alerting people about crises had been improved since then, and he worried that disputes best handled by campus security could quickly turn deadly with more guns on campus. “I grew up in the country and a lot of people had guns,” Mr. Boice said. “But my father said never carry a gun unless you are prepared to kill somebody, and I believe that.” Proponents concede the proposal could face a fight, even in this state’s Republican-controlled Legislature. The police chiefs at Arizona’s universities and several law enforcement groups have condemned the bill. “This is a very polarizing issue,” said John Wentling, vice president of the Arizona Citizens Defense League, a gun-rights group that has pushed for the bill. Even if Ms. Johnson’s bill eventually passes both chambers, it will probably take some convincing for Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, to sign it. Ms. Napolitano rejected a bill a few years ago that would have lifted a prohibition on carrying loaded firearms into bars, restaurants and other places that serve alcohol. Ms. Johnson’s proposal has gotten a mixed reception on the campuses. Jason Lewis, 23, an aerospace engineering major at the University of Arizona, said he was mugged twice on campus last year, at knife point and at gunpoint. He now has a concealed-weapons permit and carries his gun everywhere he can. “It would at least let me protect myself,” said Mr. Lewis, one of a few students to testify in support of the bill at a recent hearing. “If word gets out students are arming themselves, criminals will be, like, ‘Maybe we should back off.’ It will be a deterrent.” But Cole Hickman, a student at Arizona State University in Tempe, said he had sought to rally opposition to the bill, concerned that, among other things, it would further jeopardize people during a mass shooting. Proponents of the bill, Mr. Hickman said, underestimate the difficulty in shooting a live target in a chaotic episode. “If another student in the room or a teacher had a gun and opened fire they may hurt other students,” he said, “because unlike police officers, concealed-weapon permit holders are not necessarily well-trained in shooting in crowds and reacting to those kinds of situations.” Ms. Johnson is not fazed by the skeptics. “We are not the wild, wild West like people think we are,” she said. “But people are more independent thinkers here when it comes to security.” Advertisement"
