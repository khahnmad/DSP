Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a little less than nine months after her near-fatal wounding in the Tucson mass shooting. The Arizona lawmaker attended a retirement ceremony for her husband, ex-astronaut and Navy Capt. Mark Kelly. ""As vice president I get to work with an awful lot of people who devote their lives day to day to public service,"" Vice President Joe Biden said. ""But  it's not everyday you encounter examples of sheer, sheer courage,  selflessness and dedication, like you see in this couple."" A pool report said ""Giffords wore glasses, black pants and running shoes. She also wore a  brace on her right hand."" ""She smiled as she came in,"" the pool report said. ""Her hair is still  short but has grown out a little since her Aug. 1 vote on the debt  ceiling. She sat in the front row ... She stood up  on her own for the pledge of allegiance and invocation, which was  delivered by the Rev. Patrick Conroy, who is the House chaplain. ""Our nation has gained in the gift of self from this great citizen,"" Conroy said. Here is more from the pool report by Stephanie Innes of the Arizona Daily Star: Pool was escorted into the Secretary of War Suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at approximately 12:45 p.m. Approximately 50 guests were seated in the room, which is decorated with the first U.S. flag to fly over Paris after the liberation at the end of World War II. Guests included NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, Under Secretary of the Army Joseph William Westphal and Vice-Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mark E. Ferguson. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sat in the front row, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Adam Smith, Erik Paulsen and Pete Olson as well as retired U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton. The ceremony began at 1:40 p.m.  Biden later apologized for the late start, explaining he had been visiting with Kelly and his family in the West Wing. Kelly came in with his family, including daughters Claudia and Claire Kelly, mother Patricia Kelly, Giffords and Giffords' mother Gloria Giffords. There was prolonged applause when they came in. Giffords entered the room with her chief of staff Pia Carusone. ... One of his daughters helped award Kelly the Legion of Merit, and Biden helped pin it on his jacket twice since it came loose the first time. The Legion of Merit was established by Congress in 1942 to recognize members of the armed services who demonstrator, ""exceptionally meritorious conduct in performing outstanding services."" Giffords got up on her own to help present her husband with the Distinguished Flying Cross medal, which he earned for commanding the fourth and final flight on the space shuttle Endeavour. She pinned it on his jacket with her left hand. Biden commented that she did a better job with the pinning than he did. Biden said he was honored to officially retire Kelly. He said Kelly and Giffords had requested he perform the ceremony. He said Kelly's daughters, who are 16 and 14, are both very bright and beautiful and joked that they should not be allowed to date until they are 30. ""Mark I hope to hell you have big guard dogs,"" Biden said. He introduced Kelly's mother and Giffords' mother. Giffords waved and smiled at both women. As Biden introduced individual guests, Giffords looked at each one, smiled, waved and blew some air kisses. ... He said Kelly has, ""commendations galore,"" including top decorations given by the Pentagon and NASA. He noted that service is a Kelly family tradition. Both of Kelly's parents were police officers and Kelly's identical twinbrother, Scott is also an astronaut. He spoke directly to Kelly, saying that after he graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy with highest honors, ""you knew you wanted to fly,"" and he became a naval aviator. He said that Kelly flew 39 combat missions on two deployments during Operation Desert Storm on the USS Midway with the U.S. Navy. ""Then came the opportunity to fly higher and you took it,"" Biden said. ""The Navy lent you to the NASA astronaut corps in 1996."" Biden said Kelly did his job with ""humility and humor."" On one shuttle mission that included the task of repairing a faulty toilet at the International Space Station, Kelly, ""floated through the airlock and said, 'I understand you are looking for a plumber.' And one hell of a plumber you were."" He commended Kelly for leading the Endeavour space shuttle in May and spoke directly to Giffords, saying she is an inspiration to thousands of people who suffer from traumatic brain injuries. ""I don't use the word loosely. You are an inspiration. You've been inspirational, people looking, saying 'I can make it, I can do this,'"" Biden said. He thanked Kelly for being devoted to his nation and his family. ""You have spoken to the whole country,"" he said. Kelly was the final speaker. He said it has ""truly meant a lot to us,"" to have so many people ""in our corner"" during the last eight months. ""Gabby and I want to thank you for your boundless friendship and optimism as our family has traveled this road over the last eight months,"" he said. Kelly said there is no greater friend and no worse foe than the U.S. Navy. ""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to fly in space not just once but four times,"" he said. ""NASA is the example of scientific research, development and success and must remain a permanent part of the fabric of this great country."" Kelly gave flowers to his daughters and to Giffords. He gave Giffords a bouquet of pink tulips. ""Gabby, you remind me everyday to deny the acceptance of failure,"" Kelly said. ""I look forward to the next phase of our life together and watching all of your future achievements."" The pool was escorted out of the ceremony at 2:15 p.m.. A private reception with family was held with crackers and cheese, sandwiches and dessert.

41859054,2011-09-19 21:00:04,Yemen: unfinished business | Editorial,http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/19/yemen-unfinished-business-editorial,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,international relations",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Eight months on and Sana'a has just witnessed another mass shooting of anti-government protesters. Yemen's dictator, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is still sheltering in Saudi Arabia, and stalling on the plan mediated by the Saudis and other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council for a political transition. And Oxfam has just issued another report saying widespread hunger and chronic malnutrion have taken hold, with a third of Yemenis – 7.5 million – not having enough to eat. Despite this, the UN-administered Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan has only 55% of the funding it needs this year. Little, in other words, has changed, except maybe the characters who are directing the shooting. If the snipers put in place by Saleh were blamed for most of the 52 deaths on 18 March which became a turning point in the uprising, this time the finger of suspicion points to his son Ahmed, soon to be 40 and thus a presidential candidate himself. Saleh Sr once likened running Yemen to dancing on the heads of snakes. But he was surely being modest about his own role in fomenting the chaos and the killing. He is one of those snakes and his bite continues to be lethal.  Neither the US nor the Saudis are innocent bystanders in all this. For most of the last eight months the US has displayed more energy in hitting al-Qaida affiliates in the south of Yemen with drone strikes than it has in forcing Saleh out. This may not be accidental. The Washington Post reported a significant escalation of drone strikes on Yemen after the US administration concluded that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) posed a more significant threat than al-Qaida in Pakistan. Unlike in other parts of the Arab spring, Yemen's uprising has not affected co-operation between the US and Yemeni forces. That was confirmed in terms by Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser John Brennan last week, although he went on to say that the violence between loyalist troops and tribal leaders has not involved Yemeni special operations forces trained by the US. In Sana'a this distinction will not be so neatly made, as the Republican Guard, the best-armed and the best-trained of Yemen's armed forces, upholds the writ of Saleh and his son. The state department, on the other hand, issued a statement giving the Yemeni government one week to sign and implement the transition agreement. The US and the Saudis want a co-operative regime in Yemen. The Saudis seek stability on their southern front. Strategic objectives are a long way from meeting the demands of Yemenis who have shed so much blood with such courage. Their champion has yet to emerge, and until it does their uprising is unfinished."

Spends 18 months in prison. November 2009 US army officer Major Nidal Malik Hasan kills 13 people and injures 30 more in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base in Texas. The military psychiatrist opened fire with two handguns on fellow soldiers at a training centre. Hasan heard Awlaki preaching at the Dar al-Hiraj mosque in 2001 and also received religious advice from him via email. December 2009 Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempts to blow up a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines jet on Christmas Day with a bomb concealed in his underwear. US officials believe Abdulmutallab met Awlaki in Yemen just weeks before the attempt. Awlaki later admitted that he had ""communications"" with the Nigerian, though he denied any role in the attack. April 2010 The US authorises Awlaki's capture or killing, and he is placed on the CIA target list. The imam says in a videotape that jihad against the US is the duty of every able Muslim. May 2010 Faisal Shazhad attempts to set off a car bomb in Times Square. He tells interrogators he was influenced by Awlaki's rhetoric and inspired by his online messages. May 2010 Roshonara Choudhry, a 21-year-old British Muslim student at King's College London, stabs the Labour MP Stephen Timms, after selecting him from a list of MPs who had voted in favour of invading Iraq. Police believe she had no direct contact with Islamic extremists but was entirely self-radicalised by the online sermons of Awlaki. July 2010 The US names Awlaki as a ""specially designated global terrorist""', and blocks his assets and mademakes it a crime for Americans to do business with him. October 2010 Saudi militant Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri masterminds an al-Qaida ink-cartridge bomb described as the ""most sophisticated"" device seen for a decade. The bomb, discovered at East Midlands airport, is timed to detonate over the eastern seaboard of the US. Asiri had fled to Yemen in 2008 and was in touch with Awlaki. November 2010 Yemeni authorities place Awlaki on trial in absentia, charging him with inciting violence against foreigners in connection with the killing a French security guard at an oil company compound. Prosecutors claim Awlaki and his cousin, Osman, were in contact with the alleged attacker, Hisham Assem. Awlaki is placed on Yemen's most-wanted list. 30 December 2010 Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-born US citizen, is arrested by the FBI for an attempted bombing. The American-born Somali planned to detonate the device as thousands attended the lighting of a Christmas tree in the centre of Portland, Oregon. It is thought he was inspired by Awlaki. September 2011 Believed to have been killed in an air strike between the provinces of Marib and Jawf."

Swat and police search for gunman in Sunnyvale and Cupertino on Wednesday,  Oct. 5, 2011. (Karen T. Borchers/Mercury News)  As a massive manhunt for suspected gunman, Shareef Allman continues, Lee Wilson, pastor at Open Bible Faith Community Church, who knows Allman, talked to the media urging Allman to peacefully surrender, on Oct. 5, 2011 in San Jose. (Dai Sugano/Mercury News)    A day that began with a pre-dawn bloodbath at a Cupertino cement plant, grewinto a massive manhunt that spread through a residential neighborhood in Sunnyvale, where SWAT teams in heavy body armor swept from house to house, frantically looking for the killer. By the time darkness fell Wednesday, three people were dead, seven more had been treated for gunshot wounds at area hospitals and the suspected shooter, Shareef Allman, remained at large. Allman, a 47-year-old heavy equipment operator at Lehigh Hanson’s Permanente Cement Plant, , had been in a safety meeting with more than a dozen co-workers when, police say, he pulled a gun from his waistband and began shooting. One of the survivors of the shooting told the Mercury News that Allman felt co-workers were trying have him fired after he was repeatedly accused of driving recklessly at the quarry. The shooting spree set in motion a day-long manhunt  along the Homestead Road corridor separating Cupertino and Sunnyvale. Schools went into lockdown mode or told students stay home, and residents watched police helicopters hover over the neighborhood and nervously tried to figure out if the gunman might be in their back yard. With search dogs winding through creeks and around schools, the manhunt continued into the night. “Overnight we’ll continue to search for the suspect using the tips we get,” Sheriff Laurie Smith said.  “We know the area that we searched is clear. Adjoining neighborhoods, please lock your doors, like you do every night. … We still believe the suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.” Smith issued a plea for Allman to peacefully surrender. So did some of his friends, including some of the South Bay’s most prominent African-American leaders who described him as a peacemaker who campaigned against domestic violence and mentor to troubled youth. “This is not the Shareef that we know,” said Jethroe “Jeff” Moore II, head of the Silicon Valley NAACP. The long day began at 4 a.m. in a trailer where workers and supervisors met each morning. Allman took a stance he had practiced at area shooting ranges, where he often went with his .40-caliber handgun. Then he methodically moved down a line of coworkers, firing at each one until they fell, then moving to the next as if he were taking target practice, authorities said. Authorities identified the dead as Mark Muñoz, 59, of San Jose, John Vallejos, 51, of San Jose, and Manuel Piñon, 48, of Newman, all employees of Lehigh. “He pulled out a Glock and just shot everybody and kept on shooting,” said Mike Ambrosio, 45, a union shop steward who was shot in the arm. Allman then retrieved an AK47 he had brought with him to the quarry, apparently intent on settling grievances over his safety record as a truck driver at the plant. Then, when the shooting stopped, he disappeared into the darkness in a 1999 Mercury hatchback, until shortly before 7 a.m., when he abandoned his car at a Pho restaurant on Homestead  Road. Shortly before 7 a.m., Craig Corfield, a tennis pro who lives in the neighborhood across the street from what will eventually be the new Apple headquarters, heard three loud bangs. “I didn’t know they were gunshots, but I thought, ‘That sounded funky,'” Corfeld said. “Ten minutes later I heard sirens, and five minutes after that I walked out of our garage and there were helicopters everywhere.” According to police, Allman attempted to commandeer the car of a woman in the parking lot of a Hewlett-Packard campus on Homestead Road, shooting her in the arm, but failed to get her car. By 7 a.m., he had melted into the neighborhood along the Cupertino-Sunnyvale border, where for the rest of the day, sheriff’s deputies and SWAT teams from around the South Bay roamed the streets in heavily armored vehicles, searching every house and yard with the help of bloodhounds. “The search dogs were able to get a scent from the car but they were handicapped by the rain,” the sheriff said. Just before 10 a.m., Liz Houle stood in her driveway as a police helicopter swooped low over the street. Minutes earlier, two officers wearing flak jackets and toting automatic weapons climbed over a fence and clambered down to Calabazas Creek, which runs directly behind the Houles’ home. Two of the family’s children were rushed off to school by their father, Phil, but the other two were marooned inside the dragnet because their school was locked down. After monitoring a neighborhood message board all, day the Houles saw a SWAT team right outside and decided it was time to go. “It was getting kind of crazy. Some of the neighbors were saying it feels like a war zone,” Liz Houle said. “People are definitely nervous.” Schools in Santa Clara, Cupertino and Sunnyvale closed or kept their students in a lockdown, some well past the regular end of the school day. But schools are expected to be back to normal Thursday. “We got through a tough situation and nobody got hurt and everybody stayed calm,” Peterson Middle School principal Susan Harris said. By Wednesday afternoon, police had recovered a shotgun, handgun and two assault rifles, some from Allman’s abandoned car. But Smith presumed that  Allman was still armed. Many residents in the area received reverse 911 calls warning them to stay indoors, and authorities cautioned that Allman had little to lose. The manhunt kept Grace Chu of Fremont from getting to a baby-sitting assignment with her grandson. When she arrived around 8 a.m., she couldn’t get past the police blockade, so she called her daughter. “She’s right in the middle of it,” Chu fretted. “I’m a little worried. She didn’t even know what was going on when I called her.” Allman’s neighbors at Stonegate apartments in North San Jose described him as a likeable, sharp-dressed guy, a single parent who goes to church and works out a lot. Several said he was a former semi-professional boxer. Neighbors said they never saw him do anything violent. All expressed shock when they learned he was suspected in a mass shooting. Neighbor Albert Salazar, 51, said he had known Allman a long time. He spoke to him three days ago and didn’t notice anything unusual. They talked about growing up under hard circumstances and how they turned their lives around. “It makes no sense,” Salazar said. Wayne Riley went to high school with Allman’s daughter. “He was a good parent. He was always doing something to take care of his kids,” Riley said. “I do not know what happened.” Many of his neighbors used to watch the community TV show Allman produced on San Jose’s cable CreaTV, and saw him as a successful entrepreneur. In a videotaped interview, Allman talked about a book he wrote to empower women against domestic violence. “I’m a father and raised a daughter from birth,” Allman said in the interview, “and growing up in that type of environment and seen men abuse women, I said I can do something as an individual to make a difference.” Outside the cement plant, relatives of workers gathered at police lines, hoping to find out if their loved ones survived the shooting. At midmorning, with dozens of family members anxiously awaiting word, one woman screamed and fell over backwards in a faint. A light rain began to fall at one point, then at almost exactly the time Allman was attempting a carjacking several miles away, a rainbow appeared over the two besieged communities.

Activists and Democrats attribute the shift to a hard-charging president, a powerful new infrastructure of gun control advocates, and a handful of gubernatorial victories — all of which have helped to end Democratic caution about guns. By
      
        Evan McMorris-Santoro Posted on October 7, 2015, at 9:12 a.m. ET WASHINGTON — Just a few hours after a gunman shot and killed two Virginia TV reporters live on air Aug. 26, while the details of the shooting were still a confusing mess, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took to Twitter. Heartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, started talking about gun control and a political solution to the Virginia deaths. She had talked about it before then, and since then, she's unveiled a set of gun control measures. President Obama expressly promised to ""politicize"" the Oregon deaths in his first remarks following the murders last week, the latest in a series of emotional speeches he's delivered after mass shootings. These days, they’re just the two most prominent Democrats of the many elected officials willing to talk about gun control early and often. This is the sound of the new gun control political safety net working, say advocates and Democratic political strategists. That Democrats move instantly to politicize shootings — and invite the sustained criticism of gun rights supporters, who view the move as callous at best and calculated at worst, for doing it — is now an expected part of the national debate. Not too long ago, it really wasn’t. Democrats might say they’d be interested in exploring gun control if asked about it, or start any conversation about gun control by talking about their own firearms collections, or say that the untenable politics made the idea unrealistic. It wasn’t something Democrats generally brought up on their own and it wasn’t a topic they were especially interested in dwelling on. Over the last few years, advocates and activists have worked hard behind the scenes to show politicians likely to support new gun laws that politicizing won’t hurt them and that the gun industry lobby isn’t as powerful as they thought. Groups like Americans for Responsible Solutions, founded by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, a mass shooting victim, and her husband, Mark Kelley, and Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, are regularly meeting with top staff in Democratic circles to discuss messaging strategy, and trying to prove the gun lobby can be beaten by funding state-level political action and touting it to national party strategists. Those efforts, President Obama’s personal commitment to the cause, and the victories of a handful of Democratic governors who’ve run on gun control messages have gone a long way in changing the Democratic conversation. “People have some air cover now,” said a senior Democrat in the orbit of Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who won re-election in 2014 after championing a slew of gun control laws after Newtown. The National Rifle Association targeted Malloy — as well as Colorado Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who also supported and signed new gun laws — but both men won their elections in a dark year for Democrats. Smarter, more powerful gun control advocates helped, said the Malloy source. “There’s an additional savvy to them,” the source said, referring to the new gun control advocates at Americans for Responsible Solutions and Everytown. “They’ve got good methodologies, good polling, good tactics, and they’ve got money. That was something the NRA had institutionalized.” Obama turned Democrats back to gun control with his forceful but ultimately unsuccessful push for it after Newtown in early 2013; Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe won as a gun control Democrat in a purple state in late 2013. Observers in Democratic politics and the gun control community argue both events helped make the party comfortable with making shootings political once again. McAuliffe’s good friend, former president Bill Clinton, once signed the 1994 crime bill that in Democratic mythology helped cost the party the Congress in Bill Clinton’s first midterm elections thanks to its gun control provisions and subsequent NRA backlash. When Obama steered the party back toward gun control in January 2013, the first real Democratic efforts in the area since that bill, Bill Clinton urged caution in meetings with Obama supporters. By early 2014, Bill Clinton was headlining an Americans for Responsible Solutions fundraiser in New York City and giving advice on Democrats can do more to pass restrictions on gun purchases. In between came McAuliffe’s election. Running for governor in the state that’s home to NRA headquarters, McAuliffe promised expanded background checks and a return to the state’s defunct one-handgun-per-month purchase limit. He celebrated his low grades from the gun lobby and bet that voters for whom gun control is on the list of policy priorities would outvote the single-issue firearms voters gun rights groups like the NRA had successfully turned out for years. McAuliffe won his election. Clinton campaigns with McAuliffe in 2013. According to an attendee who related the story to BuzzFeed News last week, Bill Clinton held an impromptu strategy session with Americans for Responsible Solutions leadership on his way out the door from the New York City event, poking one senior member of the group’s leadership in the chest to emphasize the point that McAuliffe had changed the game. McAuliffe took on the NRA, but focused on “access” issues like background checks rather than demonizing gun ownership, Bill Clinton said, according to the source. The next election cycle, 2014, was terrible for Democrats. But the wins by Hickenlooper and Malloy, as well as various state, legislative, and other victories by gun control advocates resonated, they said, and the groups scrambled to make sure gun control wasn’t blamed for 2014 the way it was for 1994. (The examples may not be perfect — Malloy governs a blue state, for instance.) Shortly after the election, Americans for Responsible Solutions staff met with senior officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) to show them how to use microtargeting to find voters open to a gun control message without turning a whole election in a tough state into a referendum on gun control, according to a person who attended the sessions. A DCCC spokesperson confirmed committee staff have met with representatives for Americans For Responsible Solutions as well as those from Everytown. The DSCC did not respond to a request for comment. Fear among advocates that Democrats might go weak on gun control after sticking their necks out on it in 2013 was part of the reason for the meetings, the attendee said, but advocates would have reached out even if things had been “rosy” for Democrats. The goal was to share the knowledge about modern gun control campaigning with the party most likely to be interested in it in future elections. Gun control advocates — or “gun safety advocates,” as they prefer to be called — said they still faced a lot of cautious politicians, especially Democrats. But the partisan lines around the issue are also changing with the help of the new gun control advocacy, they said. “Washington is certainly a town of political calculation, but as the strength of our community has grown, it’s become something that our elected leaders can’t ignore,” Hayley Zachary, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, told BuzzFeed News. She said her talks with politicians sometimes still result in “antiquated responses” to the politics of the guns, but that looking away from Washington has helped her make the point that pushing for expanded background checks and other measures isn’t the political risk it once was. “We have found Republicans and Democrats who are willing to meet with us,” Zachary said. Groups have touted successes in winning over Republican lawmakers on the state level, and they note the 2013 Senate bill pushed by the White House had bipartisan backing. The politics are shifting, even if the players in the gun control debate aren’t really, she said. What political leaders want is to know that they’ll be supported if they vote for gun control — and that the voters who will back them after the vote can be found and pulled out. They want the same help from gun control supporters opponents have had for decades. “There is definitely a history of political involvement on this issue from the gun lobby,” Zachary said. “We are up against them more than we are against a political party.” Millions of dollars are flowing in support of gun control now, and the politicians that take risks have backup they didn’t used to. “There’s nothing like a scorecard,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown. “We’re out there; everybody knows we’re out there. Thirty-six states in this last legislative session. And, winning. Beating the gun lobby... That speaks 1,000 words.” National politicians, especially Democrats, are open to talking about gun control even as gun rights advocates continue to control the Washington debate, making national legislation practically impossible. Howard Wolfson, a former top Bloomberg and adviser who helped oversee the billionaire former mayor’s super PAC spending in 2012 and 2014, said even small state-level wins reverberate. “Politics in D.C. is stuck on a gridlocked partisan loop on nearly every every issue,” he told BuzzFeed News in an email, “but in the states we are having real success — and people are noticing.” The NRA has certainly noticed. The group has been running ads aimed at tearing down a nonexistent Bloomberg presidential candidacy since August. The impact on Democrats of a consistent gun control push from the White House and a support system to back it up on the trail is clear. But gun politics are still some of the toughest politics around: While polls routinely show huge majorities of Americans favor stricter federal background checks and tighter regulations on gun purchases, 2016 will be the first test in a long time of how willing they are to vote against politicians who continue to block background check expansion. Gun rights advocates have shown they’re still willing and able to punish lawmakers who cross them, or at least convince them that the politically beneficial path after a mass shooting still steers them well clear of new gun laws that, the gun rights advocates often point out, might have done little to prevent the event in question. Democrats who have stared down the NRA and found an infrastructure to back them up say the feeling is liberating. “You can vote your conscience here and that’s something you couldn’t say five years ago,” the Malloy insider said. “The most interesting contrast is between 2008 and 2016,” said Feinblatt, president of Everytown. “Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were not debating gun issues in 2008. I’d argue they were doing just the opposite because they had really accepted the notion that no matter how you felt about it in your heart, it wasn’t worth the political risk of talking about it.” Seven years later, Feinblatt said, there’s been a “sea change” in Democratic presidential politics. “Clinton is talking about it and she’s talking about it everywhere, not selectively,” he said. “And Bernie Sanders is actually trying to convince voters that his record on guns is actually better than most people think. … That is a completely different political calculus, and I think that’s happening because of what’s happening in the states.” Bob Beauprez ran against Hickenlooper in 2014.

U.S.-Born Top Al Qaeda Leader Killed Sept. 30, 2011 — -- Radical al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki's life may have ended in the violent blast of an airstrike in the heart of Yemen, but it started a half-a-world away in the heart of America. Al-Awlaki was born in 1971 in New Mexico, where his Yemeni-born father was attending school, but as a boy moved back to Yemen with his family in 1978. He returned to the U.S. in 1991 to attend college in Colorado. By 1994, al-Awlaki, who had no formal religious training, had become the imam of a Muslim center in Denver. He moved to San Diego in 1996, where he attended graduate school and served as an imam at a local mosque. While al-Awlaki was establishing himself as a religious leader, he was also succumbing to temptation. In San Diego, he was twice arrested for soliciting prostitutes. He pled guilty both times, paying a fine and attending an AIDs awareness class for a 1996 charge and paying a fine, performing community service and serving three years of probation for the second offense. It was al-Awlaki's ties to jihad, however, that brought him to the attention of federal authorities. In San Diego, he met with an associate of so-called ""Blind Sheik"" Omar Abdel Rahman, who had been convicted in connection with the 1993 terror attack on the World Trade Center. He was also serving as the vice president of an Islamic charity founded by a man believed to be an Osama bin Laden associate. The charity was thought to be an al Qaeda front. After a federal investigation, no charges were brought. Two of the future 9/11 hijackers visited and met with al-Awlaki while he was serving as an imam in San Diego. In 2000, Nawaf al-Hamzi and Khalid al-Midhdar, both Saudis, traveled from an al Qaeda summit in Malaysia, where both the upcoming attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen and 9/11 were discussed, to San Diego. While staying in California, the men attended al-Awlaki's mosque and had private meetings with him. The 9/11 commission report later found: ""Another potentially significant San Diego contact for [9/11 hijackers] Hazmi and Mihdhar was Anwar Al-al-Awlaki, an imam at the Rabat mosque. ... The operatives may even have met or at least talked to him the same day they first moved to San Diego. Hazmi and Mihdhar reportedly respected al-Awlaki as a religious figure and developed a close relationship with him.""  Al-Awlaki moved to Washington, D.C., in early 2001 where he pursued further graduate education at George Washington University and served as the imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Falls Church, Virginia. In Falls Church, al-Awlaki's services were attended by al-Hamzi and a third future 9/11 hijacker, Saudi national Hani Hanjour. After the 9/11 attacks, the FBI interviewed al-Awlaki repeatedly. His telephone number had been found in the Hamburg, Germany apartment of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a 9/11 planner now detained at Guantanamo Bay. But just weeks after the terror attack, and days after he'd been interviewed by the FBI, al-Awlaki was invited to a private lunch at the Pentagon as part of an effort to reach out to the Muslim community. When asked by ABC News if al-Awlaki had actually attended the lunch, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said, ""We believe that to be true."" ""We believe it was hosted by a small group within (but not including) the Department of Defense General Counsel's staff,"" a Pentagon spokesman told ABC News. Al-Awlaki left the U.S. for Yemen shortly afterwards. When he returned to the U.S. briefly in 2002, federal authorities again missed a chance to hold him. The FBI had watched al-Awlaki after the 9/11 attacks, and were searching for a reason to detain to him. They observed al-Awlaki, who had already had two prior convictions for soliciting prostitutes, driving prostitutes from Washington across the Potomac River into Virginia. They considered holding him under the Mann Act, an obscure federal law that prohibits transportation of women across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. Ultimately, federal agents did not detain al-Awlaki or prevent him from leaving the U.S. They were, however, able to come up with a federal arrest warrant for al-Awlaki that could be executed should he return to the U.S. Investigators found that the U.S.-born al-Awlaki had falsely indicated on his 1990 Social Security number application that he had been born in Yemen. Because the statute of limitations had passed, agents could not charge al-Awlaki with social security fraud. But since al-Awlaki had used his Social Security number to apply for a U.S. passport in Denver several years later, investigators believed he could be successfully charged with felony passport fraud. The alleged offense had occurred within the ten-year statute of limitations. In October 2002, al-Awlaki passed through JFK airport. Authorities detained al-Awlaki, who was on a terror watch list. But they found they could not arrest him, because the day before he arrived in New York his arrest warrant had been rescinded by a federal judge in Denver at the request of the U.S. Attorney's office. Shortly after he was released from JFK, al-Awlaki left the U.S. for good. From 2002 to 2004 he lived in the U.K. In 2004, he returned to family's home village in Southern Yemen. He has lived in Yemen ever since, where U.S. authorities said he was a recruiter for al Qaeda, a leading figure in al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and the inspiration for terror plots in the U.S. and Canada. Al-Awlaki had extensive e-mail exchanges with Maj. Nidal Hasan, charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009  mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. He praised Hasan in a published message soon after the shooting. Accused ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian charged with attempting to blow up Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, met with al-Awlaki while training for jihad in Yemen, say U.S. authorities. Faisal Shahzad, who pled guilty to attempting to detonate a car bomb in Times Square in May 2010, has said he was inspired by al-Awlaki. President Obama authorized the military and the CIA to kill al-Awlaki in early 2010, an unusual step given that al-Awlaki retains his U.S. citizenship. The ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights later tried, unsuccessfully, to challenge the government's right to put al-Awlaki on a hit list and freeze his assets. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) had formally labeled al-Awlaki a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"" so that it could freeze his assets. Al-Awlaki responded with several internet messages that taunted President Obama and the U.S. military and called on U.S. residents to wage jihad against the U.S.  In November 2010, he released a 23-minute video via radical Islamist web sites in which he said that any jihadi who wanted to kill Americans didn't need a ""fatwa"" or special religious permission, since Americans are the enemy and the ""devil."" ""Don't consult with anybody in killing the Americans,"" says al-Awlaki on the tape, sitting at a desk with an ornate dagger tucked into his belt. ""Fighting the devil doesn't require consultation or prayers seeking divine guidance. They are the party of the devils."" The U.S. and Yemeni government had made previous unsuccessful attempts to kill or capture al-Awlaki. Officials said in December 2009 that they believed he might have been killed in a missile strike. In September 2010, Yemeni officials said they thought they had trapped al-Awlaki in a South Yemeni village, but then dropped that claim. Less than a week after Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in a raid in Pakistan on May 2, U.S. drones tried and failed to kill al-al-Awlaki in Yemen, according to U.S. officials. Unlike previous strikes in Yemen that have involved Tomahawk cruise missile launched by Navy ships, the May strike involved a predator drone. Before his death, several U.S. officials said that al-Awlaki's ability to inspire lone wolf attackers made him one of the most dangerous men on the planet.

Reporter Amy Powell and Photographer Edgar Alcala get ready for their 11 a.m. KABC live shot outside Scott Dekraai's Huntington Beach home, Thursday morning, Oct. 13, 2011.  HUNTINGTON BEACH – Neighbors of a house searched late Wednesday in connection with the deadliest shooting in Orange County history said one thing stood out about the man who lives there: His total devotion to his son. Police identified Scott Dekraai as their suspect in the midday shooting at a Seal Beach beauty salon that left eight people dead; he was being held on suspicion of murder. Court records show he has been fighting his ex-wife – who colleagues said worked at the salon – for custody of their son since 2007. They were in court together Tuesday, the day before the shooting, for a routine hearing, records show. His ex-wife’s attorney said Dekraai had been seeking full custody of their son, but a court-ordered report issued last week had recommended against that. “His demeanor was always very controlled, almost serene,” attorney John Cate Jr. said. “In my dealings with him, I never saw him get upset, get agitated.” He described Dekraai as “monotone.” Cate said he believes his client was one of the first killed in the mass shooting at Salon Meritage on a busy Wednesday afternoon. Police have not released a list of the victims, and the Register is not naming the ex-wife without official confirmation. Dekraai, who turns 42 next week, had worked for some time as a tugboat operator. He badly injured his leg in 2007 when he rushed to help another crew member after a tow line snapped, according to a Register report at the time. His next-door neighbor, Stephanie Machow, 29, said he sometimes grumbled about his ex-wife, saying their divorce case began shortly after his leg injury. Machow waved to him Wednesday morning as she left for work, and assumed he was returning home after dropping off his son at school. “Never could I imagine him doing this,” she said. “I thought he was the nicest guy ever. … The only reason I could imagine him flipping out is because of some kind of argument over his son. He was everything to Scott.” Several neighbors identified a photo of the suspect as the man they knew as Scott. Dekraai lived in a single-story gray house on Melody Lane in Huntington Beach, which police blocked off with yellow tape Wednesday evening. Neighbors said they often saw Scott walking his white Lab or playing baseball with his son. Jake Rennison, 17, said Scott once asked him to teach his son to skateboard. Jake said he taught the boy how to kick flip. “He was totally devoted to his son. Totally,” Jake said. “I can’t believe this happened. The only thing I can imagine is with the custody battle. His son was his life.” Dekraai married the woman who is now his ex-wife in Clark County, Nev., in early 2003, records show. He filed for divorce in Los Angeles County in 2007, a month after his tugboat accident, court records show. His attorney at the time, Don Eisenberg, said Dekraai gave him “no reason to suspect a thing.” Another attorney has since taken the case, and Eisenberg said he hasn’t heard from Dekraai since 2009. “I know they had a difficult relationship,” he said of Dekraai and his ex-wife. “But that’s nothing that would foreshadow a tragedy life this.” &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; –Register staff writer Ron Campbell contributed to this report.

42988876,2011-10-13 10:29:30,Seal Beach shooting: Custody dispute seen as motive,http://feeds.latimes.com/~r/TheHomicideReport/~3/zvglXohr_-g/seal-beach-shooting-custody-dispute-seen-as-motive.html,en,False,"suits and litigation,murders and attempted murders",6,LA Times,http://www.latimes.com/," A custody dispute may have been at the center of a mass shooting that left eight people dead at a Seal Beach, Calif., hair salon. Police on Wednesday night had not released the alleged gunman's name or  the identities of the victims, nor had they established a motive. But  friends and witnesses who knew the salon employees said the alleged  gunman was Scott Dekraai and he appeared to be targeting his former  wife, who was a stylist at Salon Meritage. They said the couple had been  involved in a bitter custody dispute involving their son. Full coverage: Deadly shooting at Seal Beach hair salon Dekraai, 41, allegedly stormed into the salon about 1:30 p.m. and  appeared to be looking for his former wife, Michelle Fournier, according  to friends and witnesses. Dekraai is a resident of Huntington Beach. It  was unclear whether Fournier was among those killed.  According to Los Angeles County Superior Court documents, Dekraai  initiated a divorce case in 2007 against Fournier, whose last name was  then Dekraai, court spokeswoman Mary Hearn said. A judge ruled that all  contact between the couple had to be via text or email, except for a  10-minute phone call once a week to discuss their child's education and  well-being.  At the time of the court dispute, Hearn said, it appeared that Dekraai  was awarded custody and Fournier had to comply with several conditions  to see the child, such as to not consume alcohol 24 hours before  visiting. In August 2010, the case was transferred to Orange County Superior Court at Dekraai's request, according to Hearn.  Fournier always seemed to be in a great mood and enjoyed her children,  said Judy Rodriguez Watson, co-owner of the Bay City Center where the  salon is located. ""She was a sweet, sweet, loving happy mama,"" Watson  said. ""She was always showing off photos of her kids.""  She said she believes Fournier has three sons.

On Wednesday evening, however, the Huntington Beach house was roped off by police tape, and homicide detectives stood on the front lawn as the father became the only suspect in the Seal Beach salon shooting that left eight dead and a ninth victim in critical condition. Christa Andrews, who lives down the street, said Scott Dekraai, the alleged gunman, moved in about two years ago. He told her he had been honorably discharged from the military and had a work-related leg injury that caused him to walk with a limp. She said Dekraai would play baseball and soccer with his son, who looked to be the age of Andrews’ 7-year-old. The family had a white Labrador named Conway that they taught how to play catch. Full coverage: Deadly shooting at Seal Beach beauty salon Patty Roach, a hairstylist who lived two streets over, would pass by the house a few times each day on her usual dog-walking route. Roach has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, and she said it has always been an unassuming place with mostly middle-class families raising children. The street is lined with modest homes with well-kept lawns. Skeletons and cobwebs hang from doorways for Halloween. Roach said it was hard to believe that the man they know from the neighborhood could be behind the shootings. She said that after her husband found out, he said again and again, “There’s no way it could have been him.” Stephanie Malchow, who lives next door to Dekraai, described the family as a loving one. ""They’re always outside playing with dog,"" she said, referring to DeKraai, his current wife Mindy and a son from Dekraai's previous marriage. Malchow also remembers attending Dekraai's wedding.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)  SEAL BEACH– Ron Sesler was working the lunch rush at his steakhouse just blocks from the beach in this seaside town when he heard a rapid ‘pop, pop, pop’ sound that he at first thought was construction noise. But when a frantic woman burst through the restaurant and into the kitchen, screaming ‘”They’re shooting people, they’re shooting people!” he knew it wasn’t jackhammers. Over the next nightmarish minutes, Sesler watched as hairstylists and customers from the next-door Salon Meritage streamed into his restaurant seeking refuge from the largest mass shooting in Orange County history. Hysterical stylists still wearing their smocks with hair clips in the pockets and customers halfway through dye jobs and permanents piled inside Patty’s Place as Sesler locked the door and his wife frantically dialed 911. Police soon showed up and used the restaurant as a temporary base to interview witnesses. “The whole place was filled, it was whoever survived,” said Sesler, 68, still noticeably shaken on Thursday as he tried to resume business as usual. “We just locked the doors and waited for police. It seemed like a long time — minutes — but it was probably seconds.” Minutes after the shooting Wednesday, police stopped 41-year-old Scott Dekraai a half-mile from the scene and arrested him without incident. Sesler said the witnesses who came to his restaurant believed that Dekraai’s ex-wife, Michelle Fournier, was the second person shot in a spree that claimed the lives of eight people and left one woman in critical condition. The only victim not shot inside the salon was a regular at Patty’s Place and a good friend of Sesler. He happened to park directly next to the gunman and was shot while sitting in his car talking on his cell phone, Sesler said. “He just happened to park right beside the shooter. I saw him sitting there bleeding before they took him away,” he said. “He randomly missed it by three or four minutes either way. If he was late, the guy would have driven away. If he was early, he would have been in here” eating lunch. The witnesses who gathered in Sesler’s restaurant, many of them longtime friends, said Dekraai first took aim at the salon owner, Randy Fannin, and shot him once in the head and then turned to his own ex-wife, shooting her three times. Fannin’s wife, Sandy, escaped only because she was in the back, possibly mixing hair dye, Sesler said. A masseuse hid in the massage room with two others and locked the door. Two more hid in the bathroom, Sesler said, according to accounts from people who were interviewed by police inside his restaurant in the immediate aftermath. “They were hiding and calling 911 while the shooting was going on. They all came in here,” he said. “If you were there, you were either shot or hiding.” An elderly woman fled the salon after the shots broke out and seemed frozen on the sidewalk. Sesler’s wife, Patty, grabbed her through the restaurant’s side door and pulled her into the kitchen, Sesler said. The shooter had been staring directly at the woman but didn’t fire, he said, adding that he offered her a glass of wine and peanuts to calm her after her police interview was done. As things calmed down, police swarmed Sesler’s restaurant to interview survivors. Every table was filled, with four or five cops attending to each survivor, and some hairstylists took customers with half-finished dye jobs and perms to a salon next door to rinse their hair, he said. “There were more cops than there was tables,” he said. “They were breaking people down on what happened, doing interviews.” Another woman who witnessed part of the shooting, Kimberly Criswell, said she heard two short “pops.” Criswell, who owns another salon near Salon Meritage, said her receptionist then screamed out, “He just shot that man!” She gathered her employees and clients and locked them in the handicapped bathroom while calling 911. “I’m sure I’ve lost some friends,” she said as she waited for news outside a spiritual center and library where victims’ family members were taken. Sesler said Dekraai, the suspect, was well known in the community and grew up in Seal Beach. His grandparents’ names are inscribed on gold plates the size of playing cards a weathered memorial bench that sits in the shopping complex between the salon and the restaurant where the victims took refuge. The couple had lived in Seal Beach for decades and he lived in an apartment above their house in his early 20s, said Tim Terbush, who was close friends with Dekraai’s ex-wife. Dekraai and Michelle Fournier had been going through a bitter custody battle over their young son, according to court records, and had a court hearing in the matter earlier in the week. Just hours before the shooting, Sesler said, Michelle Fournier had stopped by the restaurant to ask about the lunch special and promised to come back. “She never made it,” he said.

Eskenazi remembers Webb being a big movie buff, a motorcycle rider and a “nice young lady.” “She was one of those happy people … never got angry and was a very nice person.” Eskenazi added that Webb was creative and seemed to enjoy her work. “Whenever you wanted to do something different, she would help you achieve that. “She had quite a following.” The hairdressers at Salon Meritage were a close-knit group who spent time together outside of work. Eskenazi said the salon owner, Randy Fannin, would throw Christmas parties for his staff. “He (Scott Dekraai) took all these innocent lives … It’s terrible that he killed his ex-wife, then he took all these people with him,” Eskenazi said. Eskenazi remembers seeing Stretz, who has two other daughters and a son, at a recent Casino Night event at the Los Alamitos Youth Center. “She was pretty involved,” Eskenazi said. “Hattie liked to travel to different places and was involved with schools.” Contact the writer: amolina@ocregister.com or 714-704-3794 Get the latest news delivered daily!

Friends and family members gather outside the Seal Beach Public Library after the shooting.  Friends and family members gather outside the Seal Beach Public Library after the shooting.  0utside the Seal Beach Public Library on Wednesday.  A man who declined to give his name wipes away tears in front of the memorial at Salon Meritage. He said he was deeply saddened and talked of the kindness he had experience from the people who worked in the salon.  Friday morning a note of love and devotion was left for shooting victim Michele Fast. The memorial for the victims of Wednesday's mass shooting expanded greatly and wrapped around the building at Salon Meritage.  SEAL BEACH – The young boy at the center of a bitter custody battle that prosecutors say led to Orange County’s deadliest mass shooting last week spent the minutes of the massacre sitting in his principal’s office. He was waiting, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said, for his mom or dad to pick him up. Rackauckas appeared to tear up during a Friday news conference and took several moments before adding: “That little boy is a victim.” Police have released few details about the 8-year-old boy who was caught in an ugly custody dispute between suspect Scott Dekraai and one of the victims of the massacre, Michelle Fournier. Seal Beach police Chief Tim Olson said the boy is staying with family. Confidentiality rules prevent Orange County Child Protective Services from saying whether the agency was involved in the boy’s placement. But spokeswoman TerryLynn Fisher said it’s entirely possible the boy went to stay with family members without ever entering the county’s system. Child Protective Services would only take the child if there were a report of child abuse or if police needed a place for him to stay, Fisher said. In such cases, social workers immediately start looking for relatives or close family friends who can care for the child. There’s no set order for who they call first, Fisher said. They’re looking for “somebody that the child knows, so that the child’s life is not disrupted any more than it needs to be,” she said. But it’s “completely possible” that the boy never entered protective custody, Fisher said. Schools often require parents to list “alternate pickups” – people authorized to pick up their child if they can’t make it. The school or police could release the boy to the alternate pickup without ever calling the county, Fisher said. The boy’s parents could also have named a backup guardian in a will or other legal document to take the boy if they could no longer care for him. His caretakers could seek to adopt him. Other relatives or friends also could go to court to seek custody. Fournier had two other children from a previous marriage. In cases when a child is left without parents, the goal would be to place him with siblings, Fisher said. “Ideally, in cases where there is no will or the parents haven’t made their wishes known, the relatives and friends who are close to the child would meet with the children to determine what would be in the best interests of this child and his siblings,” Fisher said. She added that it’s important for the child to have as much privacy as possible and to receive counseling from a specialist in children and grief. Rackauckas said Friday that it was the question of who should have custody of the boy that exploded into a shooting rampage that left eight dead in a Seal Beach beauty salon on Oct. 12. The boy’s mother was dead, Rackauckas said, and his father was charged as a mass murderer. “What kind of sick, twisted fatherly love might that be?” Rackauckas said.

One of the seven fatalities is removed from the Cal State Fullerton library in 1976.

The body of an unidentified person appears at upper center on sidewalk.  SEAL BEACH – Patricia Almazan watched her father die in the hospital. Mortally wounded by three gunshots that struck his back and his head, Frank Teplansky was 51 when he died in a mass shooting at Cal State Fullerton on July 12, 1976. That rampage, which killed seven and wounded two, was Orange County’s worst single episode of violence until two weeks ago, when a two-minute spree of gunfire inside Salon Meritage in Seal Beach killed eight people and wounded one. One of the last things Teplansky did before dying was squeeze the hand of his only daughter. Almazan, now 66, says the psychological wounds persist more than 35 years after the slaying. “One never recovers from such a heinous event,” Almazan says. “It becomes part and parcel of your DNA, and then on to the next generation.” Relatives, friends and witnesses connected to the Seal Beach mass killing on Oct. 12 are in a fog of shock and disbelief — on top of their suffocating grief, say experts in trauma who have lost loved ones to mass killings and other violence. These survivors face a long, difficult road in regaining a sense of normalcy and achieving a measure of recovery that, at this stage, may seem impossible, experts say. But it is possible. Jeffrey Dion is deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C. In 1982, Dion’s sister, Paulette, 23, was strangled to death in Atlanta by serial killer Ottis Toole, whose other victims included Adam Walsh, the boy whose death led to the national TV show “America’s Most Wanted,” hosted by his father, John Walsh. “Grief is a path you walk,” said Dion, also director of the National Crime Victim Bar Association. “You can walk now, or walk later, but you’re not going to get to the end of your journey unless you walk down that path.” It’s a sentiment familiar to those affected by other mass killings, from Columbine High School in 1999 (13 dead, 24 wounded) to Virginia Tech in 2007 (32 dead, 25 wounded). *** Randy Fannin, Michelle Fournier, Michele Fast, Lucia Kondas, Dave Caouette, Christy Wilson, Victoria Buzzo, Laura Webb Elody. The names of the eight people who lost their lives in the Seal Beach shootings are becoming etched in Orange County’s public conscience. Behind each name are hundreds of people devastated by those violent deaths, and thousands more who may not have known the victims but who still have been stained by a trauma prosecutors say was inflicted by a disgruntled ex-husband enraged by a custody battle. The slayings sentenced countless people to forever altered lives. Some of those people, say other survivors, are destined to struggle. “You know that old theory about ‘closure’?” says Carla Jacobs, whose mother-in-law, Roma Jacobs, was killed by her own daughter in 1990. “Well, there’s no such thing as closure. It’s been more than 20 years, and it’s not over. It’s not over emotionally. The best way I can describe it is that it’s become muted.” *** Roma Jacobs’ daughter had a history of schizophrenia when she burst into Roma’s home with guns and knives on Oct. 14, 1990. Victoria Jacobs “Betty” Madeira, 43, stabbed Roma, 78, of La Canada Flintridge, several times in a patio area, and then followed her into a kitchen. While Roma Jacobs was begging a 911 operator for help, Madeira shot her dead – the blasts recorded over the phone. Carla Jacobs, 62, of Orange recalls having to clean up after the murder of her future mother-in-law when police and paramedics left the house that night. “To this day, I can still see the kitchen splattered with blood and brains,” Jacobs says. “It was horrible. Most of the blood on the phone was on the number 9, since Roma died making a 911 call.” Madeira was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. The killing transformed Jacobs into a mental health activist. She serves on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center and works to reform mental health treatment laws. Jacobs says that as relatives, friends and witnesses connected to the Seal Beach tragedy work through their grief, many – like her – eventually may find a new calling as advocates for causes connected to violent crime. First, though, they have to get through today. And the next. And next. *** Post-traumatic stress disorder, popularly associated with war veterans and sometimes with first responders such as police or firefighters, is “very common” for survivors of one-time violent events like the Seal Beach mass shooting, says Dion. He’s worked with thousands of victims and has helped spearhead the establishment of several victims’ rights bills. It’s crucial, he says, for people to recognize symptoms of PTSD – among them, nightmares, difficulty sleeping, depression, anxiety. Treatment is helpful and effective, he says, comparing it to having windows broken in a smoke-filled house. “Treatment helps ‘ventilate’ the traumatic images,” Dion says. Whatever stage a person is at in the grief process, it’s vital that he or she get support, he says. “I don’t think it’s ever too soon,” says Dion, adding that it’s important for survivors not to be isolated – and to spend time with others who’ve experienced the same trauma. “Just knowing that you’re not the only one going through this can make a huge difference in breaking down the walls of isolation,” Dion says. In the days after her mother-in-law was slain, Jacobs felt helpless – a feeling she believes the loved ones of the Seal Beach victims are experiencing. “You’re trying to figure out, ‘What can I do?'” Jacobs says. “But you can’t do anything.” The process of working through such feelings, along with grief and anger, is “messy,” Jacobs says. It’s not, she says, as clean as grief manuals make it seem. *** Many Seal Beach survivors will be looking at the prosecution of Scott Evans Dekraai, 42 – he faces the death penalty, if convicted – as a milestone in their healing process. “People oftentimes look at a criminal prosecution as a goal; they think, ‘If I can just get beyond that, everything’s going to be OK,” Dion says. He and others say, however, that a conviction provides only partial comfort. “In working with other victims, a lot of outsiders think that what we want is vindication or punishment,” Jacobs says. “But I haven’t really found that to be true. “You can’t punish away the pain of what you’ve gone through. You carry it with you the rest of your life.” *** Murder trials such as Dekraai’s can drag on for years – disrupting the lives of the victims’ loved ones. “You become cynical,” Almazan says. “This happens, particularly, when there’s a long, drawn-out court case. “And every time (the killer or accused killer’s) name is brought up in the media, the victims suffer.” Whenever Allaway’s name in mentioned – as well as Dekraai’s – Almazan’s anger is palpable. “I don’t care if this (accused) killer is nuttier than a fruitcake or an evil coward,” she says. “He should be taken down like a mad pit bull. If you kill a bunch of people, you should get nothing. You should be taken out immediately – just like the victims were.” *** It’s difficult for people to know what to say to loved ones of a homicide victim. What can one possibly say, for example, to Sandy Fannin, who held her mortally wounded husband in her arms until help arrived at the Salon Meritage? Or what can one say to relatives of the other victims, including the lone survivor, Hattie Stretz, 73, who is Laura Webb Elody’s mother? “Only your closest family and close friends get it,” Almazan says. “Others want it forgotten as soon as possible to ease their own minds.” Loved ones of the Seal Beach victims need to brace themselves for a reality, Dion says. “People should not expect to reach a point where everything is going to be back the way it was.” He warns of triggers – a sad movie, a TV commercial, almost anything – that, years later, can take a person back to the day of the killings. Be aware of these triggers, he says. That can ease the traumatic memories. “Something like this shapes you,” Dion says. “The most important thing a survivor can do is focus on themselves and their own recovery.” Jacobs says fighting for treatment for the mentally ill has helped her cope. She advises loved ones of the Seal Beach victims to, eventually, embrace a purpose. “If there’s a way to help prevent the next episode like this from occurring,” Jacobs says, “well, that’s the only good that can come out of this.” Victims, witnesses and impacted community members who would like to speak to a crisis counselor and/or receive victim services should contact CSP Victim Assistance Programs – Crisis Response Team at 949-975-0244.

She recalled instances in which he cared for an  Irish setter and her pup after the adult canine was struck by a car on  the freeway. Another time he found an injured owl in the desert and  wrapped a T-shirt around his motorcycle handlebars so the bird could grip while he  drove to a raptor rescue center. The bird later recovered. Ritchie said his death was especially hard because her other friend  Lucia Kondas, who also worked with Oakleaf, was one of the victims in  last month's mass shooting in Seal Beach.

A note of gratitude is left for  Laura Webb-Elody at the Salon Meritage memorial in Seal Beach.  A note of remembrance is left for Laura Webb-Elody  outside the salon among the thousands of flowers.  A note that reads in part, ""To my Dearest Friend Laura Webb - I will love and miss you all the days of my life...Remember we are ""sisters. "" was taped to the outside of Salon Meritage.  A tribute to stylist Laura Webb-Elody was left at the memorial outside  Salon Meritage.  A note of sorrow was left at the memorial for Salon Meritage stylist Laura Webb-Elody.  A note to Laura Webb-Elody that reads, ""Dearest Laura, I will always miss your laughter, Love, Melinda"" , sits on a windowsill at Salon Meritage.  A photograph of Laura Webb-Elody was taped to the windows of Salon Meritage.  Laura Webb-elody was with family when she was shot. Her mother, Hattie Stretz, was in the salon, getting her hair done by her daughter, when the shooting took place. Stretz, 73, also was shot during the attack. Authorities said Thursday that Stretz's condition is improving and she is expected to survive.  The memorial for the victims of Wednesday's mass shooting has expanded greatly and wraps around the building at Salon Meritage.  Photographs of the victims of Wednesday mass shooting are beginning to be added to the memorial at Salon Meritage, including these of Laura Webb-Elody giving young clients their first haircuts. Webb-Elody was with family when she was shot. Her mother, Hattie Stretz, was in the salon, getting her hair done by her daughter, when the shooting took place. Stretz, 73, also was shot during the attack. Authorities said Thursday that Stretz's condition is improving and she is expected to survive.  A floral wreath in honor of Laura Webb-Elody was recently hung on the windows of Salon Meritage.  It was about 3 p.m. Wednesday when Patricia Eskenazi’s phone began blasting. She didn’t know it, but she was getting news – again and again – about a mass shooting that took eight people, including her friend and hairstylist, Laura Webb. “I’m so sad. I’m probably in shock more than anything, said Eskenazi, 74, president of the Los Alamitos Seal Beach Rotary Club. “I know it has happened, but I still don’t believe it.” Webb, who turned 46 this month, was Eskenazi’s hairstylist for the past 12 years. Police identified her as Laura Lee Elody, but Webb was married about nine months ago and used her married name. Webb was with family when she was shot. Her mother, Hattie Stretz, was in the salon, getting her hair done by her daughter, when the shooting took place, Eskenazi said. Stretz, 73, also was shot during the attack. Authorities said Thursday that Stretz’s condition is improving and she is expected to survive. Eskenazi remembers Webb being a big movie buff, a motorcycle rider and a “nice young lady.” “She was one of those happy people … never got angry and was a very nice person.” Eskenazi added that Webb was creative and seemed to enjoy her work. “Whenever you wanted to do something different, she would help you achieve that. “She had quite a following.” The hairdressers at Salon Meritage were a close-knit group who spent time together outside of work. Eskenazi said the salon owner, Randy Fannin, would throw Christmas parties for his staff. “He (Scott Dekraai) took all these innocent lives … It’s terrible that he killed his ex-wife, then he took all these people with him,” Eskenazi said. Eskenazi remembers seeing Stretz, who has two other daughters and a son, at a recent Casino Night event at the Los Alamitos Youth Center. “She was pretty involved,” Eskenazi said. “Hattie liked to travel to different places and was involved with schools.” Contact the writer: amolina@ocregister.com or 714-704-3794 Get the latest news delivered daily!

Follow @TIME Updated: 12:25 a.m. Sometimes, rumors of violence beget actual violence. Saturday's mass shooting at a Safeway on North Oracle Road in Tucson, which killed six and left Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others gravely wounded, may well be one of those occasions. It's impossible to know this early what the motivations for the attack were. Was the alleged shooter — who has been identified as 22-year-old Tucsonan Jared Loughner — angry about immigration? Or perhaps another hot-button issue? YouTube videos ascribed to him bore the mark of mental illness — they were conspiratorial, unintelligible, espousing no particular cause — but no matter his mental state, his crime took place in an overheated political environment. Last March, at the height of the health care reform battle, Giffords' office was vandalized. She mentioned in an MSNBC interview that a Sarah Palin graphic had depicted her district in the crosshair of a gun sight. ""They've got to realize there are consequences to that,"" she said. ""The rhetoric is incredibly heated."" The corner next to her office had also become, she said, a popular spot for Tea Party protests. (See ""40 Under 40: The Rising Stars of American Politics."") As Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik put it in an extraordinary and melancholic press conference after the shooting, ""we have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" He added that he's ""not aware of any public officials who are not receiving threats."" Another shooting victim, a federal judge named John Roll, had been placed under 24-hour security in 2009 after ruling in favor of illegal immigrants in a high-profile case. It's unclear why he was at the supermarket event. But for almost a year now, Arizona's leaders have been grappling with anti-immigration sentiments, inflamed by reports of crossborder violence. National media attention, with its attendant voices of hysteria, only added to the churn. Pundits spoke gravely about a wave of violence, born in Mexico and now flooding Arizona. Arizona's two most famous politicians fueled the fury. Republican Senator John McCain, facing an unexpected reelection challenge from the right, ran a campaign obsessed with crossborder crime. And GOP Governor Jan Brewer, who invited the national spotlight by championing strict anti-illegal immigrant legislation, talked of beheadings in the desert. The only problem with all this talk about a massive crossborder crime wave is that it wasn't true. Phoenix had not become one of the world's kidnapping capitals. Crime rates in Arizona had been steady or even fallen in some areas. There had been no beheadings in the desert. There were plenty of deaths there, but they were pathetic and meek tragedies: impoverished border-crossers, abandoned by their heartless guides, dying of exposure and dehydration. (See the top 10 American political prodigies.) But the idea of a state under siege took hold. When I was on the border last year reporting on the murder of rancher Rob Krentz, I talked to many who sincerely believed that they were under attack. Krentz's murder was a terrible event, but it was an isolated event. The relatively small number of home invasions, holdups and other crimes deeply disturbed border communities, but only because they had been living in such calm for so long. Their crime rates still don't match most cities in the states. The supermarket meet-and-greet where Giffords was shot was actually a testimony to just how safe southern Arizona is. As a press release from her office last week put it, ""'Congress on Your Corner' allows residents of Arizona's 8th Congressional District to meet their congresswoman one-on-one and discuss with her any issue, concern or problem involving the federal government."" Not exactly the kind of event a politician would hold in a war zone. (See TIME's complete coverage of the Tucson shooting.) It's true that Giffords was not a fan of the state's anti-immigration bill SB1070, but there were higher-profile opponents, such as her fellow Congressional Representative in Tuscon, Raul Grijalva. Yet the idea that Arizona is under attack has been pushed hard enough that it's very possible that the coward who shot her (in the head, according to a Tucson paper) believed that the 40-year-old Democrat, who had been tarred by some as soft on immigration because she didn't support SB1070, was contributing to larger-scale violence against Arizonans. If that is the case, it would only add to the tragedy. The fact is, that among all the overwrought promises and all the panic I heard last summer in Arizona, I found that Giffords was one of the few politicians offering concrete law enforcement steps that would actually work against the drug cartels and other smugglers. It's not just that she fought for more money and police for border protection, although she did that. She co-sponsored legislation last year with a California Republican that aimed to give law enforcement important new tools in cracking down on the cash cards that were a favored methods of money-laundering. It was one of the many sensible, pragmatic ideas she had for cracking down on crime. Whatever dark fantasies drove someone to try to take her life, Giffords is a sensible politician who was likely shot because she dealt with Arizona's reality, not its rumors.

          / AP WASHINGTON - Eighty-three victims and family members in the worst-ever mass shooting at a U.S. military installation are seeking $750 million in compensation from the Army, alleging that willful negligence enabled psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan to carry out a terrorist attack at Fort Hood, Texas. The administrative claims filed last week said the government had clear warnings that Hasan, who is scheduled to go on trial in March, posed a grave danger to the lives of soldiers and civilians. The government bowed to political correctness and not only ignored the threat Hasan presented but actually promoted him to the rank of major five months before the massacre, according to the administrative claims against the Defense Department, the Justice Department and the FBI. Thirteen soldiers and civilians were killed and more than two dozen soldiers and civilians were injured in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting spree. Fifty-four relatives of eight of the murdered soldiers have filed claims. One civilian police officer and nine of the injured soldiers have filed claims along with 19 family members of those 10. ""It was unconscionable that Hasan was allowed to continue in the military and ultimately be in the position to perpetrate the only terror attack committed on U.S. soil since 9/11,"" attorney Neal Sher, who represents the claimants, told The Associated Press. Fort Hood victims' kin holding private memorials ""We're aware claims have been filed, but we're not going to comment on it,"" Christopher Haug, chief of media relations for the public affairs office at Fort Hood, said Thursday. ""They'll be taken seriously and they'll go through the legal process."" Among the claimants is a civilian police officer who shot Hasan, Sgt. Kimberly Munley, who was hit in the leg and hand in an exchange of gunfire that has cut short her law enforcement career. She underwent a series of surgeries for her wounds and is on unpaid leave from her post as a civilian police officer with the Army. ""I brought this claim because I strongly believe this tragedy was totally preventable and that the Army swept under the rug what they knew about Hasan,"" Munley said in a statement. Munley and her partner, Sgt. Mark Todd, another civilian officer in Fort Hood's police force, are credited with shooting Hasan, ending the violence. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. U.S. officials have said they believe Hasan's attack was inspired by the radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and that the two men exchanged as many as 20 emails. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in late September. His name has not yet been mentioned in any hearings in the criminal case against Hasan. ""It is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed al-Awlaki, while Hasan was promoted in the Army which enabled him to carry out his murderous terror attack,"" said Sher, who for many years ran the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations that hunted Nazi criminals living illegally in the United States. He also is a former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. Evidence of Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism was on full display to his superiors and colleagues during military medical training, according to a Senate report issued in February and included as an exhibit accompanying the claims. In the events leading up to the shooting, an instructor and a colleague each referred to Hasan as a ""ticking time bomb,"" according to the report by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Susan Collins of Maine, the chairman and ranking Republican, respectively, on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In classroom presentations, Hasan repeatedly spoke of violent Islamist extremism instead of medical subjects and justified suicide bombings, said the report, which concluded that Hasan's superiors failed to discipline him, refer him to counterintelligence officials or seek to discharge him.

The attack occurred Nov. 1 when a transient, 47-year-old Richard Lawrence Kalfin, approached David Oakleaf in the store's sporting goods department and began beating him. Sheriff's officials said it did not appear Oakleaf had any warning of the attack. ""It’s one of the most brutal attacks I have ever seen,"" Sheriff's Lt. Ed Hernandez said at the time. In interviews with The Times, his friends said he was known as ""Daytona Dave""  and dedicated his time and  energies to the American Motorcyclist Assn., advocating for  off-road motorcycling interests as well. He was also an ambassador for  the sport in California, working out of the group's district office in  Glendale. ""Dave was a very active contributor and well-liked by his fellow    delegates. He was very   involved in local and state issues regarding  motorcycling,"" said AMA spokesman Pete Terhorst. ""His loss is a    terrible tragedy for the motorcycling community."" Clifford Cross, who co-owned a desert property and ran a business with Oakleaf, said he was stunned to learn of Oakleaf's death.

He had so many friends."" In a statement posted on the AMA's website, Jim Geddes praised  Oakleaf as a mentor and tireless advocate who worked ""to protect  competitive and leisure trail riding throughout California."" ""Without the efforts of Dave, competitive dirtbike racing in Southern  California would surely be a thing of the past,"" Geddes wrote. ""For  that matter, every off roader who enjoys recreating on two stroke bikes  owes Dave a great debt of gratitude.""  Oakleaf gained a  reputation for being an aggressive advocate for the cause. ""The off roading community was faced with very strict emission  requirements that would banish all two stroke bikes manufactured after  1997 off of public lands,"" Geddes wrote. ""Working with other  stakeholders and agency personnel, Dave would not sign off the plan  until they worked out what is currently referred to as the 'red sticker'  program. Thanks to his efforts, bikes with red stickers can compete in  any sanctioned off road event, and can trail ride during certain times  of the year throughout Southern California."" Oakleaf moved to the Long Beach area 45 years ago from upstate New  York. He took a job with the Los Angeles County's Department of Public  Social Services in El Monte. He retired 20 years ago. One of his former colleagues, Eileen Ritchie, described Oakleaf as a  kind and tenderhearted man. She recalled instances in which he cared for an  Irish setter and her pup after the adult canine was struck by a car on  the freeway. Another time he found an injured owl in the desert and  wrapped a T-shirt around his motorcycle handlebars so the bird could grip while he  drove to a raptor rescue center. The bird later recovered. Ritchie said his death was especially hard because her other friend  Lucia Kondas, who also worked with Oakleaf, was one of the victims in  last month's mass shooting in Seal Beach. ""It's cruel that two truly kind and nice people have been taken away from us by these violent acts,"" Ritchie said.

Gabrielle Giffords will speak publicly for the first time in months, describing with her husband the grueling 10-month recovery from an assassination attempt in January. ABC News’ Diane Sawyer interviewed Giffords and Mark Kelly for a special to air Monday night. It includes video footage of the Arizona Democrat through various stages of her recovery after being shot in the head from close range at a constituent event in Tucson. The network has released a brief excerpt showing Giffords saying only a few short phrases. “Pretty good,” Giffords says when asked how she feels. “Is it painful?” Sawyer asks. “It’s difficult.” The nation has seen only occasional glimpses of Giffords during the course of her recovery. Most prominently, she came to Washington in August to vote on the deal that resolved the debt ceiling crisis, a visit kept secret until she arrived in Congress for an emotional return. She made a second trip in October for a ceremony marking the official retirement of her husband, a Navy captain and shuttle astronaut. The man accused in the Jan. 8 mass shooting, Jared Loughner, faces 49 felony counts in the rampage that killed six bystanders and wounded 13 at a public event staged by Giffords. Prosecutors are expected to seek the death penalty. Experts have concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia. In May, U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns sent Loughner to a Missouri hospital after declaring that he was incompetent to stand trial. His attorneys have been battling in federal court over whether Loughner can be forced to take antipsychotic drugs to restore his mental competency to stand trial on capital charges. The Giffords interview is airing on the eve of the release of the couple’s book documenting her recovery. Kelly writes about Giffords’ anguish as she comes to understand what happened to her and other victims, including the six who were killed. The closing chapter was the work of Giffords, who writes: “I will get stronger. I will return.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Emmanuel Costas (myFOXorlando) ORLANDO, Fla. – An 18-year-old student has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after he allegedly threatened to carry out a ""Columbine"" type massacre at his Orlando high school next year. Lake Brantley High School student Emmanuel Costas was arrested Tuesday after posting multiple threats on Facebook and in text messages that he was going to carry out violence against other students. ""It was clear he planned on carrying out this attack in the school lunch room,"" Altamonte Springs police chief Michael Deal said. ""He admitted to sending these texts and he admitted to posting similar [messages on his] Facebook page. During his interview, he also made disturbing comments that he respected individuals that carried out the Columbine massacre."" Investigators released transcripts of the text messages on Wednesday afternoon. One message read, ""Everybody prepare yourselfs 4/17 let the carnage begin,"" while another read, ""A day of terror will strike upon everyone's soul."" Two days after these texts were received, a third message was sent which read, ""Damn 4/17/12 is going to be a day to remember dat day will bring joy to me and sadness to OTHERS."" Police say they also recovered papers from Costas' backpack and his home, which also documented his threats to carrying out a mass shooting at the school. Costas was charged with attempted felony murder and written threats to kill or do bodily harm. He is being held without bond at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, about 25 miles northeast of Orlando. Costas' older sister told myFOXorlando that she did not believe her brother was capable of carrying out a Columbine-style act. ""No not at all. He's not that type of person,"" she said. ""He just thought it was funny and stuff like that."" Twelve students and one teacher were shot dead by senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The pair, who had earlier made threats online about their violent plans, shot themselves before being caught by police.

Dekraai plead not guilty.  SANTA ANA – The disgruntled ex-husband charged with killing his ex-wife and seven others in a Seal Beach beauty salon in Orange County’s deadliest mass shooting pleaded not guilty Tuesday morning at his continued arraignment. Scott Evans Dekraai, 42, stood in a mustard-colored jail uniform in a courtroom holding cell as his lawyer – Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders – denied all charges and allegations and asked for a preliminary hearing for April 24. Dekraai, who is being held without bail in the case that could lead to a death sentence, was emotionless throughout the one-minute hearing before Superior Court Judge Erick Larsh, speaking only when asked if he agreed to postpone his preliminary hearing for five months. Nearly 30 friends and relatives of the slaying victims sat teary-eyed in the first four rows of Larsh’s courtroom. Several hugged each other afterwards with tears streaming down their faces. Later, several supporters talked with reporters. Paul Wilson, the husband of victim Christy Wilson, said the attention should be focused on the families and friends of the victims who continue to suffer in the aftermath of the killing spree, and not on Dekraai. “He is a coward whose soul has been in hell for a very, very long time,” Wilson said. Dekraai, who has grown a full beard since his initial court appearance, is charged with the special circumstances murders of eight people during a two-minute bloodbath at the Salon Meritage on Pacific Coast Highway shortly after 1 p.m. Oct. 12. Seal Beach police say he entered the salon armed with three guns after arguing with his ex-wife, Michelle Fournier – a stylist at the salon – over the custody of their 8-year-old son. Fournier, 48, was the first to die, shot at close range, according to authorities, as she attended to a longtime customer and friend. Dekraai then shot her customer – Christy Wilson, who also worked at the salon – and then Randy Fannin, the shop’s owner, according to police who said he confessed after his arrest. Dekraai then turned his guns on other employees and customers before he walked out of the salon and got into his pickup, according to police. He also shot and killed a man sitting in his parked Land Rover in the parking lot before driving away, police said. He was arrested about a half-mile from the crime scene after several witnesses pointed out his pickup to Seal Beach police, who were summoned by several 911 calls. Dekraai, a former tugboat crewman, surrendered without resistance to the patrolman who pulled him over, and quickly said, “I know what I did,” according to court documents. Before the day was over, Dekraai told Seal Beach police detectives that he had argued that morning with Fournier on the phone over their custody arrangement for their son, and then armed himself with three guns and drove to the beach to ponder killing his ex-wife. Dekraai confessed to driving to Salon Meritage, and launching the shooting spree, according to a detective’s affidavit in support of a search warrant. He told detectives that several of the victims were “collateral damage” after he killed his wife, according to the search warrant. He also admitted shooting Dave Caouette in his parked Land Rover because he thought he was a plainclothes or undercover police office, according to the search warrant. Several witnesses also indentified Dekraai – who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs more than 250 pounds – as the hulking gunman who systematically shot employees and customers. Sanders, whose office was appointed to represent Dekraai at the previous court hearing, agreed with Deputy District Attorney Scott Simmons to the April 24 preliminary hearing, which will test the evidence to determine of Dekraai should stand trial. But Sanders also told Larsh that he felt it was unlikely that he would be ready to proceed on that day Simmons said that the preliminary hearing was set five months off because of the complexities of the case, which have generated thousands of pages of documents and hundreds of interviews of potential witnesses. The prosecutor said his office is developing information in anticipation of an insanity defense, although Sanders has not mentioned that as a possibility yet. Several relatives and friends of Michelle Fournier told reporters in the impromptu news conference that they were angered over early media reports that appeared to criticize her parenting of Dominic, her 8-year-old son, with Dekraai. They said they were particularly upset over reports from the search warrant where detectives quoted Dekraai as claiming the boy would be covered in bruises after being with his mom. “That’s bull,” said Butch Fournier, one of Michelle’s brothers. “She was a terrific mom.” &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Contact the writer: lwelborn@ocregister.com or 714-834-3784 Get the latest news delivered daily!

45034185,2011-11-30 12:55:19,Santa poses with AK-47s at US gun club,http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/30/festive-firepower-santa-ak-47-us-gun-club,en,True,"firearms,children and youth",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"An Arizona gun club is offering a chance for children and their families to pose for photographs with Father Christmas while holding weaponry such as AK-47 rifles and grenade launchers. One image shows Santa Claus in a wingback chair with a snowflake background, a Christmas tree behind him and flanked by an $80,000 machine gun and a tripod-mounted rifle. Next to Santa is a man standing behind a boy, who is holding an unloaded AR-15 with an attached grenade launcher.  In another photo, Santa cradles a toddler dressed in camouflage, while a man and woman stand close by with rifles with foldable stocks. In another image, five young women pose with AR-15 and other rifles. Ron Kennedy, general manager of the Scottsdale gun club, said the business got the idea for the photographs last year when a club member happened to come in dressed as Santa Claus and other members wanted their picture taken with him while they were holding their guns. ""Our customers have been looking for a fun and safe way to express their holiday spirit and passion for firearms,"" said Kennedy, noting people have used the photos for Christmas cards and Facebook posts. About 500 people showed up to the first of two sittings on Saturday. Kennedy, whose facility offers guns for sale and to rent and has a 32-lane indoor shooting range, said the event was not aimed at children, but the club supports the right of parents to include children in the photos. The guns used in the photos are not loaded and have had their firing pins removed, and their chambers are regularly cleared to ensure safety, Kennedy said. To buy a semi-automatic rifle in the US, a buyer must be at least 18 years old and cannot be a convicted felon. The requirements for prospective buyers of fully automatic machine guns include being at least 21 years old, not being a convicted felon and getting a special license from federal firearms agents. Democratic state Representative Steve Farley, who proposed an unsuccessful ban on large-capacity gun magazines like the one used in the 8 January mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others, said the gun club's photo event was inappropriate. ""To involve machine guns and Santa in a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ is the worst kind of heresy I can imagine,"" said Farley. ""I would suggest that the people who created this read some of the New Testament."" Kennedy said the club is simply trying to provide a safe holiday event that's an expression of their passions. ""It's more of a celebration of their Second Amendment rights,"" Kennedy said. He said the club will continue holding the events in future years if there's a demand from customers for it."

",http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/dec/08/virginia-tech-says-shots-fired-campus/,en,True,"education and schools,colleges and universities,police,murders and attempted murders",56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"RICHMOND, Va. — A man killed a police officer and another person after a traffic stop Thursday at Virginia Tech, sending a shudder through campus as students and faculty were told to stay inside and police searched for the gunman, school officials said. It was the first gunfire on campus since 33 people were killed in 2007 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The deaths came on the same day university officials were in Washington appealing a fine that federal officials gave them over the school’s response five years ago. The campus was swarming Thursday with heavily armed officers walking around campus. Caravans of SWAT vehicles and other police cars with emergency lights flashing patrolled nearby. Students hunkered down in buildings. “A lot of people, especially toward the beginning were scared,” said Jared Brumfield, a 19-year-old freshman from Culpeper, Va., who was locked in the Squires Student Center since around 1:30 p.m. “A lot of people are loosening up now. I guess we’re just waiting it out, waiting for it to be over.” The school said a police officer pulled someone over for a traffic stop and was shot and killed. The shooter ran toward a nearby parking lot, where a second person was found dead. Various alerts were sent out to students and the university is sending updates about every 30 minutes, regardless of whether they have any new information, school spokesman Mark Owczarski said. “We deployed them all, and we deployed them immediately to get the word out,” he said. The shooter was described as a white man wearing gray sweat pants, a gray hat with neon green brim, a maroon hoodie and backpack. “It’s crazy that someone would go and do something like that with all the stuff that happened in 2007,” said Corey Smith, a 19-year-old sophomore from Mechanicsville, Va., who was headed to a dining hall near the site of one of the shootings. He told The Associated Press that he stayed inside after seeing the alerts from the school. “It’s just weird to think about why someone would do something like this when the school’s had so many problems,” Smith said. Harry White, 20, a junior physics major, said he was in line for a sandwich at a restaurant in a campus building when he received the text message alert. White said he didn’t panic, thinking instead about a false alarm about a possible gunman that locked down the campus in August. White used an indoor walkway to go to a computer lab in an adjacent building, where he checked news reports. “I decided to just check to see how serious it was. I saw it’s actually someone shooting someone, not something false, something that looks like a gun,” White said. Campus was quieter than usual because classes ended Wednesday and students were preparing for exams, which were to begin Friday. The school said those tests would be postponed. The shooting came soon after the conclusion of a hearing where Virginia Tech was appealing a $55,000 fine by the U.S. Education Department in connection with the university’s response to the 2007 rampage. The department said the school violated the law by waiting more than two hours after two students were shot to death in their dorm before sending an email warning. By then, student gunman Seung-Hui Cho was chaining the doors to a classroom building where he killed 30 more people and then himself. The department said the email was too vague because it mentioned only a “shooting incident,” not the deaths. The university’s police chief, Wendell Flinchum, testified Thursday there were no immediate signs in the dorm to indicate a threat to the campus. He said the shootings were believed to be an isolated domestic incident and that the shooter had fled. Since the massacre, the school expanded its emergency notification systems. Alerts now go out by electronic message boards in classrooms, by text messages and other methods. Other colleges and universities have put in place similar systems. Universities are required under the Clery Act to provide warnings in a timely manner and to report the number of crimes on campus. On Thursday, during about a one-hour period, the university issued four separate alerts. In August, a report of a possible gunman at Virginia Tech set off the longest, most extensive lockdown and search on campus since 2007. No gunman was found, and the school gave the all-clear about five hours after sirens began wailing and students and staff members started receiving warnings. The system was also put to the test in 2008, when an exploding nail gun cartridge was mistaken for gunfire. Only one dorm was locked down during that emergency, and it reopened two hours later.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. BLACKSBURG, Va. – The Virginia Tech police officer who was shot dead in his parked cruiser was a trained firearms and defense instructor with a specialty in crisis intervention. His death leaves investigators puzzling over how and why a gunman walked up to the patrol car during a traffic stop, killed the officer and wound up dead himself in a nearby parking lot. The campus shooting prompted officials to lock down the university for hours Thursday while police and SWAT teams searched the school, the scene in 2007 of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Authorities have in-car video from officer Deriek W. Crouse's cruiser that shows a male suspect with a handgun at the officer's car at the time of the shooting. But they have not identified the gunman and say they don't know what motivated the killing or whether there was any link between the shooter and Crouse. The shooter was not a student, university spokesman Larry Hincker said Friday. He declined to identify the suspect any more closely and said the information would come from state police, who scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. Crouse, an Army veteran and married father of five, was killed after pulling a driver over in a school parking lot. Police said the gunman was not involved in the traffic stop. Instead, he approached, shot the officer and then fled on foot before apparently killing himself in another lot. ""At this point, we haven't been able to establish any kind of immediate connection between the officer and the shooter,"" State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told The Associated Press late Thursday. ""That's obviously something that's being looked into."" State police said in a news release early Friday that ballistics tests confirmed Crouse and the deceased suspect had been shot by the same handgun. The tests have ""officially linked the two fatal shootings,"" the release said. The news release said clothing found inside a discarded backpack recovered by Blacksburg police seemed to match that of the male subject in the officer's video. Police said they were awaiting confirmation of the deceased suspect's identity as well as autopsy results from the medical examiner in Roanoke. The events unfolded on the same day Virginia Tech officials were in Washington, fighting a federal government fine over their handling of the 2007 massacre where 33 people were killed. The shooting brought back painful memories. About 150 students gathered silently for a candlelight vigil on a field facing the stone plaza memorial for the 2007 victims. An official vigil is planned for Friday night. Police would not rule out a connection between the shootings and an armed robbery Wednesday in Radford, about 10 miles from Blacksburg. According to media reports, Radford police were looking for a man they considered armed and dangerous after an armed robbery at a local real estate office. Police said Crouse called in the traffic stop at 12:15 p.m. After a few minutes passed without hearing from the officer, dispatch tried to get in touch with him, but didn't get a response. About 15 minutes later, police received the first call from a witness who said an officer had been shot at the Cassell Coliseum parking lot and the gunman had fled on foot. Authorities refused to say whether Crouse was able to defend himself or fire back at his assailant. Local, state and federal officials responded immediately. At 1 p.m., an officer saw a suspicious man in a parking lot. He had a gunshot wound and a gun nearby. This time, though, the school applied the lessons learned during the last tragedy, locking down the campus and using a high-tech alert system to warn students and faculty members to stay indoors. Heavily armed officers swarmed the campus and caravans of SWAT vehicles and other police cars with emergency lights flashing patrolled nearby. Crouse was an Army veteran and married father of five children and stepchildren who joined the campus police force in October 2007. He previously worked at a jail and for the Montgomery County sheriff's department. He was a jokester who enjoyed riding his motorcycle and rock music, his friend Aaron Proden told the AP. The two recently saw Metallica in concert in Charlotte, N.C. Crouse recently invited Proden to go on a ride-along ""just to see what he does, his job, his lifestyle,"" the friend said. ""He was a standup guy,"" said Rusty Zarger, a former neighbor whose two young daughters used to play with Crouse's sons at the townhouse complex where they lived. ""He was very mild-mannered, very confident. You could tell he was strong in believing in himself, but very comfortable."" Zarger said that after the Fourth of July, Crouse had leftover fireworks and went around the complex knocking on doors to get neighbors — especially the children — to watch him set them off. ""He came over and got all the kids to come outside and watch it — made it a very community thing when he didn't have to,"" Zarger said. A woman who answered the door at the Crouse home at the end of a three-unit townhouse building Thursday night said it wasn't a good time to talk, and they were trying to get the children to bed. A group of people were sitting around a table inside. Crouse was one of about 50 officers on the campus force, which also has 20 full- and part-time security guards. Crouse received an award in 2008 for his commitment to the department's drunken driving efforts. He was trained as a crisis intervention officer and as a general, firearms and defensive tactics instructor. ""In light of the turmoil and trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns, I can only say words don't describe our feelings and they're elusive at this point in time,"" university president Charles Steger said. ""Our hearts are broken again for the family of our police officer."" The school was a bit quieter than usual because classes ended Wednesday. About 20,000 of the university's 30,000 students were on campus when the officer was shot. Exams, set to begin Friday, were postponed until Saturday. The university also said its counseling center would be open all day Friday for students. ""A lot of people, especially toward the beginning, were scared,"" said Jared Brumfield, a 19-year-old freshman from Culpeper, Va., who was locked in the Squires Student Center. Harry White, 20, a junior physics major, said he was in line for a sandwich at a restaurant in a campus building when he received the text message alert. White said he didn't panic, thinking instead about a false alarm involving a possible gunman that locked down the campus in August. White used an indoor walkway to go to a computer lab in an adjacent building, where he checked news reports. ""I decided to just check to see how serious it was. I saw it's actually someone shooting someone, not something false, something that looks like a gun,"" White said. The shooting came soon after the conclusion of a hearing at which Virginia Tech appealed a $55,000 fine by the U.S. Department of Education in connection with the university's response to the 2007 rampage. The department said the school violated the law by waiting more than two hours after two students were shot to death in their dorm before sending an email warning, and the message was too vague because it mentioned only a ""shooting incident."" By then, student gunman Seung-Hui Cho was chaining the doors to a classroom building where he killed 30 more people and then himself. The school has since expanded its emergency notification systems. Alerts now go out by electronic message boards in classrooms, by text messages and other methods. Other colleges and universities have put in place similar systems. Andrew Goddard, who has crusaded for stiffer gun control laws since his son Colin was wounded in the 2007 shootings, said Virginia Tech's response seemed substantially better this time. ""It sounds like things moved very, very fast this time as opposed to the time before,"" said Goddard, whose daughter and nephew go to the school. ""That doesn't surprise me. Virginia Tech really did get the message in the sense that when bad things are happening, you have to ask quickly."" During about a one-hour period on Thursday, the university issued four separate alerts. Derek O'Dell, a third-year veterinary student at Virginia Tech who was wounded in the 2007 shooting, was shaken. ""It just brings up a lot of bad feelings, bad memories,"" said O'Dell, who was at his home a couple of miles from campus at the time of the shootings. ""At first I was just hoping it was a false alarm,"" he said. ""Then there were reports of two people dead, and the second person shot was in the parking lot where I usually park to go to school, so it was kind of surreal."" ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Kimberly Hefling and Ben Nuckols in Washington; Michael Felberbaum, Larry O'Dell, Steve Szkotak, Bob Lewis and Dena Potter in Richmond, Va.; and Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, Va., contributed to this report.

",http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/dec/09/motive-still-unknown-va-tech-officer-shooting/,en,True,"education and schools,police,murders and attempted murders",56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"BLACKSBURG, Va. — The Virginia Tech police officer who was shot dead at his parked cruiser was a trained firearms and defense instructor with a specialty in crisis intervention. His death leaves investigators puzzling over how and why a gunman walked up to the patrol car during a traffic stop, killed the officer and wound up dead himself in a nearby parking lot. The campus shooting prompted officials to lock down the university for hours Thursday while police and SWAT teams searched the school, the scene in 2007 of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Authorities have in-car video from officer Deriek W. Crouse's cruiser that shows a male suspect with a handgun at the officer's car at the time of the shooting. But they have not identified the gunman and say they don't know what motivated the killing or whether there was any link between the shooter and Crouse. Crouse, an Army veteran and married father of five, was killed after pulling a driver over in a school parking lot. Police said the gunman was not involved in the traffic stop. Instead, he approached, shot the officer and then fled on foot before apparently killing himself in another lot. ""At this point, we haven't been able to establish any kind of immediate connection between the officer and the shooter,"" State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told The Associated Press late Thursday. ""That's obviously something that's being looked into."" State police said in a news release early Friday that ballistics tests confirmed Crouse and the deceased suspect had been shot by the same handgun. The tests have ""officially linked the two fatal shootings,"" the release said. The news release said clothing found inside a discarded backpack recovered by Blacksburg police seemed to match that of the male subject in the officer's video. Police said they were awaiting confirmation of the deceased suspect's identity as well as autopsy results from the medical examiner in Roanoke. The events unfolded on the same day Virginia Tech officials were in Washington, fighting a federal government fine over their handling of the 2007 massacre where 33 people were killed. The shooting brought back painful memories. About 150 students gathered silently for a candlelight vigil on a field facing the stone plaza memorial for the 2007 victims. An official vigil is planned for Friday night. Police would not rule out a connection between the shootings and an armed robbery Wednesday in Radford, about 10 miles from Blacksburg. According to media reports, Radford police were looking for a man they considered armed and dangerous after an armed robbery at a local real estate office.

      Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset. Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Legal Statement. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Dec. 8: Authorities respond to reports of shots fired in the parking lot of Virginia Tech's Cassell Coliseum. (WDBJ-TV) BLACKSBURG, Va. -- The man who authorities say killed a Virginia Tech police officer was described as a typical college student in many ways, making it difficult to understand why he would commit an armed robbery and then, apparently at random, target the patrolman before killing himself. The gunman was identified Friday as Ross Truett Ashley, a 22-year-old part-time business student at Radford University, about 10 miles from the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg. He first drew authorities' attention Wednesday when, they say, he walked into his landlord's office with a handgun and demanded the keys to a Mercedes-Benz SUV. As investigators worked to unravel a motive, thousands of people gathered for a candlelight vigil Friday night on a campus all too familiar with tragedy. Those who knew Ashley said he could be standoffish. He liked to run down the hallways and recently shaved his head, a neighbor said. Virginia State Police said he walked up to officer Deriek W. Crouse after noon on Thursday and shot him to death as the patrolman sat in his unmarked cruiser during a traffic stop. Ashley was not involved in the stop and did not know the driver, who is cooperating with police, they said. Authorities said Ashley then took off for the campus greenhouses, ditching his pullover, wool cap and backpack as police quickly sent out a campus-wide alert that a gunman was on the loose. Officials said the alert system put in place after the nation's worst mass slaying in recent memory worked well, but it nevertheless rattled a community still coping with the day a student gunman killed 32 people and then himself. A deputy sheriff on patrol noticed a man acting suspiciously in a parking lot about a half-mile from the shooting. The deputy drove up and down the rows of the sprawling Cage parking lot and lost sight of the man for a moment, then found Ashley shot to death on the pavement, a handgun nearby. No one saw him take his life and he wasn't carrying any ID. State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Ashley appears to have acted alone and didn't know the slain officer: ""At this time we have no connection between the two of them, that they knew one another or had encountered one another prior to the shooting,"" she said. Ashley lived in an apartment on the top floor of a worn, gray three-story brick building in the small city of Radford, a college town. He lived above a yogurt shop, consignment store, barber shop and a tattoo parlor. On Friday night, students popped in and out of the building visiting friends. Mandy Adams, a Radford grad student, said Ashley had recently shaved his head. Other than running down the hallways, he was quiet, she said. ""He would just run down the hallway -- never walk, always run,"" said Adams, who was out on a rear fire escape with a glass of white wine and a cigarette to calm her nerves. ""It's going to be really creepy when they come to take his stuff out of here."" Neighbor Nan Forbes, a Radford senior, said Ashley was rarely seen or heard from. She said she knew he was in trouble when she saw two police officers guarding the door to his apartment ""It does freak us out because we live in this building, but there was not one peep of trouble, nothing unusual,"" she said. Ashley made the dean's list in 2008 at the University of Virginia-Wise, which is located in southwest Virginia. He took classes at Radford, a former state teachers college in the Blue Ridge Mountains that now has more than 9,000 students. Officials at Radford or UVA-Wise were not immediately able to talk in detail about Ashley. At the Virginia Tech campus, thousands of people silently filled the Drillfield for a candlelight vigil Friday night to remember Crouse, a firearms and defense instructor with a specialty in crisis intervention. He had been on the campus force for four years, joining it about six months after the April 16, 2007 massacre. Crouse was a member of the Army Reserves who served a year in Iraq beginning in March 2004, according to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command. He was assigned to active duty service at Fort Hood, Texas from October 1993 until July 1996, where he was listed as an M1 armor crewman, or tank operator. From July 1996 to May 2001, Crouse was listed as a motor transport operator with the 316th Sustainment Command in Galax, Va. Crouse's last rank was staff sergeant. For about nine months in 2007, Crouse worked as an officer with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office at the county's jail before leaving for the Virginia Tech police, said Capt. Brian Wright, a spokesman with the department. Those who worked with Crouse remembered him as a ""great employee"" and a ""hard worker,"" said Wright, who had worked security with Crouse at Virginia Tech football games. ""He was just very personable, easy to talk to,"" Wright said. ""Everybody liked him."" The Friday night vigil included a moment of silence and closed with two trumpeters stationed across the field from each other playing ""Echo Taps"" as students raised their candles. ""Let's go!"" one student then shouted. ""Hokies!"" everyone else responded. Kathleen O'Dwyer, a fifth-year engineering major at Tech, said it was important to come for Crouse's family. Crouse was married and had five children and stepchildren. ""Also it's for the community, to see the violence that happens isn't what we're about,"" said O'Dwyer, who will be graduating next week. Her plans when she leaves school? ""First, go home and hug my mom,"" O'Dwyer said. Nobody answered the door Friday evening at Ashley's parents' home in Spotsylvania County, along the Interstate 95 corridor between Richmond and Washington. The house was dark and no vehicles were in the driveway. The two-story, log cabin-style home in a semi-rural area sits about 200 yards off the road up a narrow gravel drive. Billie Jo Phillippe, who lives three houses down, said she didn't really associate with the family. ""They stay off to themselves a lot,"" she said. ""He was a clean-cut young guy but standoffish.""Authorities declined to answer some questions about Ashley, including whether he had any mental health issues or was licensed to carry a handgun. But Gov. Bob McDonnell commented briefly on the shooting while helping load presents into a van for the Marine Corps Reserves' Toys for Tots program. ""Some crimes, there's a relationship between a perpetrator and a victim, and some there aren't,"" said McDonnell, a former prosecutor and attorney general. ""There are random acts of violence, they involve either mental health issues, or robbery, or other motivations....Unfortunately in our society random acts of violence do occur, we unfortunately see it every day somewhere in this country."" He said there's an ""extra degree of scrutiny"" of incidents at Virginia Tech because of the 2007 mass shooting. ""It's just unfortunate and almost inexplicable that you could have a series of these events happen in a short four-year period,"" the governor said.

        Evan McMorris-Santoro Posted on December 5, 2015, at 7:37 p.m. ET KEENE, New Hampshire — Bernie Sanders vowed once again not to change his campaign focus Saturday after a week that saw the political conversation shift to ISIS after the mass shooting in San Bernardino and weeks after the attack in Paris. Sticking once again to his populist economic message in two speeches at New Hampshire universities, Sanders warned that the all-powerful ""they"" are using ISIS to distract voters away from America's systemic problems. ""As a nation and as a people, we have got to understand that our country faces a myriad of very serious problems... if you turn on the TV, what they now say is, 'Well we've got one problem, it's ISIS,"" Sanders said, launching into a sarcastic impression of the ""they"" on television this week. ""'We don't have to worry about old people not having enough to eat. We don't have to worry about having more people in jail than any other country. We don't have to worry about the disappearing middle class. We don't have to worry about economic and wealth inequality...we don't have to worry about institutional racism, or a broken criminal justice. We don't have to worry about that. All we should focus on now, 24/7, is ISIS,'"" Sanders said. ""Here's what I say,"" he went on, ""I say that ISIS must be destroyed and I say that we have got to build a coalition which destroys ISIS. But I say that we are a great enough country and a smart enough country that we can destroy ISIS at the same time as rebuild a disappearing middle class. We can do both."" The line was almost word-for-word what Sanders told voters in Cleveland last month after the attacks in Paris once again led to talk of ISIS on the presidential campaign trail. His campaign schedule Saturday made good on the promise. In Keene he talked about ISIS for a few minutes at the end of his standard long stump speech about income equality, election spending, climate change, immigration, universal health care, criminal justice, marijuana decriminalization and the nation's ""drift toward oligarchy."" Gun control, a major focus of Sanders' activities in the Senate last week, didn't get a mention in Keene. At Plymouth State University — the second stop of the two-stop day — Sanders did push for his standard gun control agenda, tying mention of San Bernardino into the larger conversation about gun violence. He also did the ISIS bit during the speech. The section includes shaming Middle Eastern nations like Qatar and Saudi Arabia for not doing more to fight ISIS and vowing not to send large numbers of American troops into the conflict. Sanders has repeatedly warned against a quagmire in the Middle East and citied his own vote against the war in Iraq. But it was clear ISIS — or gun control — is not going to be Sanders' rhetorical priorities after San Bernardino. The big news from Sanders' campaign Saturday was the opening rounds of a full-scale carbon emissions reduction policy plan rollout that will continue in the coming days. Sanders vowed to impose a carbon tax, reduce carbon emissions across the board by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Evan McMorris-Santoro is the White House correspondent for BuzzFeed News.

240399676,2011-12-08 12:00:00,"Virginia Tech police officer, one other killed on campus",http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/shots-fired-at-virginia-tech-campus/2011/12/08/gIQApjNafO_blog.html?hpid=z1,en,False,"education and schools,colleges and universities,police,murders and attempted murders",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"A Virginia Tech police officer was fatally shot Thursday during a routine traffic stop on the Blacksburg campus and a second person was found slain in a nearby parking lot after the gunman fled, the university reports. Law enforcement and government officials said that the person found dead in the parking lot is the gunman who killed the officer. At a news conference late this afternoon, neither state police nor university officials would confirm that the dead man was the suspect. But the authorities said there no longer was a threat on campus and they lifted an afternoon-long lockdown. Earlier, a campus-wide message warned students, “Stay indoors. Secure in place.” There are no classes today at the university, as students have a reading day to prepare for finals, which were to begin Friday. University officials postponed Friday’s exams.  The university said on its Web site that a routine traffic stop prompted the shootings. The gunman was not the person who was pulled over, state police said at a news conference. Authorities did not identify the officer, but said he was a four-year veteran of the department. Virginia Tech said in a statement that a weapon had been found by the second person found dead. Officials said at an afternoon news conference that a police officer first saw that person in the parking lot, and the person was still alive. They said the officer did not shoot him. Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said police were trying to identify the person and that no determination of suicide had been made. Geller said police believe only one suspect was involved in the shooting of the officer, and that the possibility that the suspect then killed himself is also being investigated. Jermaine Holmes, director of academic support services for student athletes, said the shooting appeared to be a traffic stop gone awry. “It’s right across from our building in the parking lot,” he said. “It didn’t appear to be just a kind of random shooting.” “The facilities folks locked down the building immediately,” he said. ”We’re not allowing any students or staff to leave.” The second body was found in a parking lot a short distance away from the original shooting, in the direction the gunman fled. Virginia Tech, a public campus of about 30,000 students, has one of the nation’s most advanced security alert systems, installed after the nation’s worst campus shooting, a 2007 rampage by student Seung Hui Cho that left 33 dead, including the shooter. University officials were criticized for taking too long to lock down the campus that day and have dramatically overhauled their alert system. The entire campus was on lockdown Thursday. In 2007, though, there was a two-hour delay from the discovery of Cho’s first two victims to the first e-mail alert to campus. Thirty others were killed in between, in an academic building. But on Thursday, alerts went out by e-mail, text-message, electronic message boards in classrooms and audible alarms on campus within minutes of the gunshots. Virginia Tech’s emergency response protocols are considered a model for other schools. “We deployed them all, and we deployed them immediately,” said Mark Owczarski, university spokesman, at a news conference. The shooting happened, by chance, on a day when Virginia Tech officials were in Washington to appeal a $55,000 federal penalty from the U.S. Department of Education over the university’s response to the 2007 massacre. Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum was among the scheduled witnesses, according to a report in the Roanoke Times newspaper. Today’s report of shots fired came in the noon hour. The first alert advised of gunshots reported at the school’s Coliseum parking lot, off Washington Street and Spring Road, in a southern section of campus devoted to athletics. It told the community to stay inside and secure doors. A second alert described a suspect as “white male, gray sweat pants, gray hat w/neon green brim, maroon hoodie and backpack,” and said he was “on foot towards McComas,” a facility housing health and counseling services. Matt Banfield, a senior from Williamsburg who is a representative on the board of visitors, said shortly after 3 p.m. that hundreds of students were still waiting in the Squires Student Center on lockdown. People were calm, he said, watching the news and checking their phones, or listening for updates from staff members. “The way the university staff is handling this … has been very comforting.” They’re handing out bottles of water and giving constant updates, he said. Students were alerted by the university in many ways, he said, including e-mails, phone calls, texts, Web site updates, and scrolling messages on the clocks in all the buildings. He feels safe, he said. “It is unfortunate that because of our past, I think people think that stuff like this happens here all the time. This could happen any place. I feel no less safe now than I have at any other point here.” Ankit Ahuja said he was among several dozen students studying at Newman Library when the campus was locked down. Told to stay away from the windows, students were staying calm and watching television for news updates, he said. “I’m just thinking about the repercussions of this,” he said. “I think for the next few weeks they’ll have stricter security on campus.” A 23-year-old graduate student from New Delhi, Ahuja said he chose Virginia Tech because of its reputation for high-quality research in his field, computer science. He knew about the 2007 shooting, but it didn’t concern him. “That was a one-off incident,” he said. “It could happen anyplace.” Shawn Ghuman, a sophomore at Virginia Tech from McLean, said that he got the first alert about the gunshots when he was in the dining hall next to his dormitory, Harper Hall, on the west side of campus near where the first shots were fired. And by the time he went outside to go back to his room, he said the campus already looked empty. “They did a really good job keeping us alerted and telling everyone to stay indoors,” he said The alerts go out via e-mail, text and robocall, he said. Students are in the middle of finals this week, and he has been going to study sessions. From the third floor window of his dorm, he can see police cars and TV trucks. I’m nervous about our reputation,” he said. “Tech’s a great school.” Freshman Miles Curley, 19, of Rock Hill, S.C., said he was leaving his dorm, Cochrane Hall, when he received a text message alert about the shooting. He had been headed for his car parked nearby in the Coliseum lot, where shots were fired. Curley said he immediately returned to his room, where he could hear sirens. He’s been checking Twitter and television news since then, he said, and fielding phone calls and texts from worried friends and family. “It’s what happened in ’07 — it’s kind of crazy to think that something even close to that would ever happen again,” Curley said. “I’m praying for anyone who’s affected.” Freshman Matthew Spencer was walking to a bus stop about 12:30 or 12:45 p.m. when he saw police running and driving by and paramedics running to an area near the bus stop. There’s a large parking lot between the stadium and McComas Hall, where students work out, he said. At least 10 police cars were in the area around Washington Street and the basketball arena, he said. That’s when he got the alert from the university to get inside. About 1:45 p.m., he saw officers racing to another part of campus. “At least 15 police and undercover cars took off on Washington Street and headed towards the town and or that side of campus where Torgenson Bridge is,” he said. “Everyone in the hallway is freaked out and stuff,” he said. He was in eighth grade when the mass shooting happened. “I lived in Christiansburg during the massacres, so it’s kind of scary.”  Staff writers Emma Brown, Michael Alison Chandler, Tom Jackman, Susan Svrluga and Clarence Williams contributed to this report.

          / AP WASHINGTON - Eighty-three victims and family members in the worst-ever mass shooting at a U.S. military installation are seeking $750 million in compensation from the Army, alleging that willful negligence enabled psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan to carry out a terrorist attack at Fort Hood, Texas. The administrative claims filed last week said the government had clear warnings that Hasan, who is scheduled to go on trial in March, posed a grave danger to the lives of soldiers and civilians. The government bowed to political correctness and not only ignored the threat Hasan presented but actually promoted him to the rank of major five months before the massacre, according to the administrative claims against the Defense Department, the Justice Department and the FBI. Thirteen soldiers and civilians were killed and more than two dozen soldiers and civilians were injured in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting spree. Fifty-four relatives of eight of the murdered soldiers have filed claims. One civilian police officer and nine of the injured soldiers have filed claims along with 19 family members of those 10. ""It was unconscionable that Hasan was allowed to continue in the military and ultimately be in the position to perpetrate the only terror attack committed on U.S. soil since 9/11,"" attorney Neal Sher, who represents the claimants, told The Associated Press. Fort Hood victims' kin holding private memorials ""We're aware claims have been filed, but we're not going to comment on it,"" Christopher Haug, chief of media relations for the public affairs office at Fort Hood, said Thursday. ""They'll be taken seriously and they'll go through the legal process."" Among the claimants is a civilian police officer who shot Hasan, Sgt. Kimberly Munley, who was hit in the leg and hand in an exchange of gunfire that has cut short her law enforcement career. She underwent a series of surgeries for her wounds and is on unpaid leave from her post as a civilian police officer with the Army. ""I brought this claim because I strongly believe this tragedy was totally preventable and that the Army swept under the rug what they knew about Hasan,"" Munley said in a statement. Munley and her partner, Sgt. Mark Todd, another civilian officer in Fort Hood's police force, are credited with shooting Hasan, ending the violence. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. U.S. officials have said they believe Hasan's attack was inspired by the radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and that the two men exchanged as many as 20 emails. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in late September. His name has not yet been mentioned in any hearings in the criminal case against Hasan. ""It is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed al-Awlaki, while Hasan was promoted in the Army which enabled him to carry out his murderous terror attack,"" said Sher, who for many years ran the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations that hunted Nazi criminals living illegally in the United States. He also is a former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. Evidence of Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism was on full display to his superiors and colleagues during military medical training, according to a Senate report issued in February and included as an exhibit accompanying the claims. In the events leading up to the shooting, an instructor and a colleague each referred to Hasan as a ""ticking time bomb,"" according to the report by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Susan Collins of Maine, the chairman and ranking Republican, respectively, on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In classroom presentations, Hasan repeatedly spoke of violent Islamist extremism instead of medical subjects and justified suicide bombings, said the report, which concluded that Hasan's superiors failed to discipline him, refer him to counterintelligence officials or seek to discharge him.
